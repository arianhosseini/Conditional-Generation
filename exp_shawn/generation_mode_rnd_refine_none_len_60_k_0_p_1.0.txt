They couldn’t answer simple questions coherently.
 They babbled and told those outrageous stories.
 They were sick.
 When my wife and I heard sirens or the phone rang late at night, we always thought the worst.
 Certain police or crime television shows would give us lumps in our throats as we would silently look at each other and know we were thinking the same thing… that might be our son.
 One afternoon while I was at work, Lisa was trying to help Brandon out by organizing some of his bills.
 Brandon told her that he needed to run a quick errand.
 She called me later that day and said she had lost track of him and he wasn’t returning her calls or answering his phone.
 All the usual horrible thoughts began to surface in our minds.
 The day turned into night and we still hadn’t heard from him.

“He was way ahead of all of us,” Skippy says.
 “His energy came from someplace else.” At any rate in early 1970, having witnessed the death of some of the gods, Buddy Gardner turned his back on Memphis, moved to L.A. with Lorelei, who then just as suddenly disappeared.
 Like a genii whose work is done.
 Some say she turned to making porno films.
 Some say she works in television.
 Some say she went back to perdition from whence she came.
 But it was in L.A. that Buddy transformed himself into a folk artist, a singer/songwriter with a heart on his sleeve and an ace up it.
 He was as mellow as yellow, as smooth as California sunshine.
 And as empty as a bird’s nest in December.
 His two albums, “I Was a Child When Smaller,” and “Rain and other Distractions,” were mega-sellers.

“Why do you think this happened to me?
 I mean, we’ve tried to figure out how I can get back, but we don’t even know why it happened.” “I don’t know, Marie.
 I still can’t really believe it happened.
 If you hadn’t been scared half to death, I would have thought you were playing a joke on me.” She smiled a bit.
 “If you’re playing a joke on me, I want to take one of your televisions home with me.”  Returning her attention to the mushroom, she frowned.
 “And that’s another thing—why 84 years in the future?
 Why not five years?
 Or 100 years—at least that’s a round number.
 Why the year 2011?” Her questions made him reflect uncomfortably.
 The fact that he’d read an article about her just days before she’d appeared couldn’t be a coincidence.

I pulled it down as I walked inside the house.
 Mom was gone, there wasn't any reason I couldn't read whatever was in the envelope in the living room, but I found myself quickly climbing up our creaky stairs and closing my bedroom door behind me.
 I tore the envelope open and pulled out a piece of heavy paper, almost like parchment.
 The writing was elegant, a kind of flowing script that was different from anything I'd ever seen, but which paled against the sheer artistry of the sigil positioned at the bottom of the note.
 Adriana, Your words of thanks were altogether unexpected, but decidedly appreciated.
 You're most welcome for whatever small part I might have played in helping events to unfold as they would have in a perfect world.
 My actions were not such as to merit any large boon from you, but still I must ask one.
 Please never show this note to anyone.
 I ask not for myself, but for the others such knowledge could affect.
 I hope your circumstances continue on much as they are now, but on the chance they do not, I can be reached by leaving a note in the hollow of the lightning-struck tree half a mile to the east of your house.

 Really, it’s in Pete’s hands, like I said.
 I’m not sure I’m even supposed to be talking about it.
 Have they ever convicted a bootlegger?
 I don’t think so.

Still the soft linen shirt of light brown, which he knew had been loose on the captain, was much more comfortable than the wizard robe he had been wearing.
 Unfortunately none of the pants would fit.
 Poir, though a large man, had skinny legs.
 Rodregas felt ridiculous wearing only a linen shirt and his coin purses as he stepped to the armory door.
 The door was built of massive slabs of iron oak.
 Rodregas reached up and pulled the emergency key from the crack at the right of the door.
 Due to his status as a senior sergeant, he knew where the key was kept.
 Once the door was open, he stepped inside.
 Immediately, his eyes went to a long side bench where several new pieces of armor were piled up.
 These would be some of the more recent pieces not yet sorted or sold off for not being of use to the guard.

Jim – (hands him a comic book) Sumo Assassin?
 Johnny – What do you think that’ll help?
 Jim – I find Skinny’s antics to be uplifting in times of sorrow.
 Well except for the time that he managed to run himself over with the Sumo-mobile.
 That was depressing.
 Johnny – How did he do that?
 Jim – Well he’s not the brightest side-kick out there.
 Johnny – Then why does would anyone keep him around?
 Jim – A couple reasons, first he can fit into places that a five hundred pound sumo wrestler would never be able to go.
 That and well just look at his costume.

It was hard to believe that it could stay up in the air.
 She'd seen airplanes before, but she'd never been in one.
 She didn't even know anyone who had.
 The plane began rolling forward!
 Squeezing Rick's hand harder, Marie listened carefully as the flight attendant explained what to do in emergencies.
 When she'd finished, Marie pointed to an overhead panel and asked Rick, "Is this where the oxygen masks fall from?"
 "I think so."
 "Haven't you ever put one on?"
 "No.
 Traveling by plane is really safe, sweetheart.

Art – That would most likely be genetic.
 Both your mother and I are reasonably smart individuals, as were our parents.
 If you’re dumb, well then your head must have been tampered with after you were removed from the packaging.
 Jim – Always possible, though I think if anything is wrong it’s because of designer flaws.
 Well, shall we get going ‘O’ he who understands women?
 Art – Listen and learn.
 First of all, I don’t understand women, nobody does, some of the time I feel that they don’t even understand themselves.
 Jim – If you don’t understand them, what makes you an expert?
 Art – Do you think all TV weathermen understand how weather is actually formed?
 Jim – Considering that ditzy blonde girl who does the weather for channel five, no I don’t think they understand the weather what-so-ever.

 Johnny – Why don’t you do something about him if he’s such an asshole?
 Eugene – What do you want me to do about him?
 Johnny – Why not report him to the police?
 Eugene – I don’t think that would solve anything.
 Johnny – Why not?
 Jim – Johnny remember the time when he called the police and told them that he was abducted by aliens?
 And that he wanted those aliens arrested and sent back to Mars because they were in the country illegally?
 Johnny – Yeah, so?
 Eugene – They have a picture of me posted in all of the local police stations.

Velixar roared, a sound that made Qurrah shiver and avert his eyes.
 His master’s back was to him, so he could not see the face that Dieredon saw, which was full of rotted skin and crawling, feasting things.
 Suddenly Dieredon pulled back.
 The blades in his bow snapped inward.
 “Arrows cannot hurt me,” Velixar mocked.
 “They did not the first time.
 Why do you hope so now?”
 “Because these arrows are different.”
 He fired three at once, all burying deep into Velixar’s chest.
 The man in black screamed as the sacred water burned his skin.

They had something on him because he would do whatever my stepfather told him to do.
 I remember going to the bank and walking in or out with bags of cash.
 The “Judge” was actually a Judge and he lived next door.
 He was a nice man.
 I babysat his kids and watched his house while he vacationed, and did some odd jobs for him.
 My stepfather and his associates spoke openly about their various girlfriends and the dual lives they led.
 Dino also had a girlfriend and a separate apartment in which he put her up.
 My brother and I were young and we were afraid of this man so we didn’t disclose what we knew to anyone.
 When I was about fourteen years old, I missed curfew, which I knew was a big mistake.
 I tried to open the door with no sound.

During recent decades, there has also been a marked movement away from subsistence level manual occupations, primarily in agriculture, to more skilled and remunerative forms of employment.
 Worldwide, the percentage of the work force engaged in agriculture has fallen by 24 per cent since 1950, from 67 to 51 per cent.
 Unemployment is of growing concern today primarily because population has expanded in recent decades even faster than job creation and because a larger percentage of the population, principally women, seek employment now than at any time in the past.
 The shortages of jobs and the resulting poverty represent the most pressing social problem in the world today.
 But viewed in historical perspective, it is clear that substantial progress has been made during the post-war period, making humanity as a whole more prosperous than at any previous period in recorded history.
 Over the past five decades, global GDP has multiplied seven-fold.
 In spite of unprecedented population growth, per capita income has more than tripled.
 Between 1965 and 1985, real per capita consumption in the developing world rose by 70 per cent.
 Despite the paramount concern raised by the persis tence of high rates of unemployment in recent years, available data do not confirm a long-term trend towards rising rates of global unemployment.

Maybe not so much at first, but I couldn't get you out of my mind.
 You were everywhere I looked.
 In my class, at lunch, even in my dreams.
 I couldn't get away from you."
 I felt my heart skip another beat.
 Everything good that I'd attributed to Brandon had been Alec all along.
 I didn't understand what I'd seen a few hours ago, but he wasn't a monster.
 The amount of hurt in his voice took him out of the category of frightening.
 I moved a little closer.
 "Do you still want me to leave?"

Rodregas knew that this was probably it.
 They had gambled and lost, there were just too many of them.
 But he did not want to die without taking out the Immortal Guards first.
 If he killed the slavers and the guards, there was a good chance that the slaves could escape.
 If Rodregas and his group died without taking the slavers and guards out, then they would have died in vain.
 Rodregas hoped Imeralda would get away.
 His shoulder jerked to the left, and he guessed that he had been hit by an arrow.
 Rodregas threw himself toward the last guard.
 He blocked the sword blow with his borrowed shield but did not have the angle to avoid a direct impact.
 The sword sliced through the shield and Rodregas jerked his arm back fearing that he would lose it.

What would possess him to go to the backdoor and not the front but being high and thus, stupid.
 Brandon had been arrested, he told us, in a set-up drug sting.
 He was in the local jail and had been calling friends to bail him out.
 Our son hadn’t called us for bail; I had told him that he shouldn’t bother me when he got busted, one thing I had said that had apparently sunk in to his thick head.
 He was alive—a relief—but we had no idea how much trouble he was in.
 The thoughts of trial and incarceration were unthinkable, but they were likely.
 The memory of accompanying my mother half way across the country to visit my brother in jail came back strong.
 I called the jail and received minimal information beyond his bail amount.
 We opted to leave Brandon in jail.
 He was released 23 hours later on his own recognizance.

People were starting to gather around us, Brandon's closest friends, the ones he ate lunch with every day, were all standing behind him, while everyone else filled out the circle.
 I looked around for some kind of support from the other girls present, but couldn't find even one sympathetic face.
 The next thing I knew I was on the ground with my ears ringing and Cassie standing over me.
 "...your stupid lies.
 If you repeat them you'll be sorry.
 Every single person here will vouch for Brandon."
 A couple of people flinched a little at that, like they weren't completely comfortable lying, but Cassie stared them down.
 Nobody would meet my gaze.
 I opened my mouth to protest, and Cassie grabbed me by the front of my jacket and dragged me the better part of twenty feet.
 My head was still spinning as she leaned down and hissed into my ear.

We contemplated the worst as we watched what was our son, our first-born, drive off into complete uncertainty.
 We didn’t know Brandon at all, and we really believed we might never see him again.
 On the day of his birth which seemed like yesterday, I had watched as his little body took its first breath and now I felt like I might be watching him take his last.
 We chose not to tell any of my wife’s family because we were quite frankly, embarrassed.
 My wife’s family was similar to the 1950s TV Cleavers, and we didn’t think they would understand, so for now it remained a family secret.
 I selfishly didn’t want their advice or opinions because I didn’t expect them to ever understand.
 In their defense, they grew up in such a pure family environment that they were ill prepared for the drama that surrounded my upbringing.
 I have come to understand their view of me as a shady character, and the unlikely marriage of my kind to their perfect daughter, and I have accepted the fact that my past was a freak show compared to their lives.
 Now I had a contemporary freak-drama in my home, and didn’t think they’d be much help with it.
 My family on the other hand, was pre-disastered.

Come on, let’s go.”
 They stopped twice for Qurrah to catch his breath.
 His weak body gasped for air, sweat lining his face and neck.
 In the starlight, he looked so pale, so frail, that Harruq wondered how his brother could be so fearsome in combat.
 When they neared the firelight, they stopped to plan.
 “So what should we do?” Harruq asked.
 “They are not asleep,” Qurrah said.
 “Something keeps them awake.
 I fear they know of our arrival.”
 “Velixar?”

He closed his eyes, letting his mind sink into the ether.
 Like scent to a bloodhound, Qurrah could sense the magic flowing all about him.
 The flame surrounding the skulls flared even brighter, but beneath their tails trailed long threads of silver.
 When Qurrah looked up, he saw hundreds of the threads twisting and curling together, coiling toward a hidden presence deep within the orc army.
 Taking in a deep breath, Qurrah pooled his strength and focused on the skull taunting his brother, visualizing the thread and seeking to sever it.
 There was a pull on his chest—the taste of copper on his tongue.
 When he opened his eyes, the skull fell to the battlements.
 The jaw snapped and rotting teeth clattered to the streets below.
 “You did it!” Harruq picked up the skull, frowning at its ordinariness.
 Shrugging, he flung it toward the distant army of orcs.

stare?"
 She blushed.
 "Oh, we stare.”  He grinned, but then his face grew sober; being able to see from her perspective made him realize that, as much as he enjoyed looking at women on the beach, the changes in modesty reflected a decay in morals that would probably make her uncomfortable.
 "Morals are one of the things that have changed a lot in the last 84 years.
 So I guess the 1920s have something on us."
 He swallowed the last of his tea.
 "Why don't we go buy you an outfit or two?"
 "I can't.
 I didn't bring any money with me.
 Would it be accepted now, anyway?"

"Run along, young lady, we wouldn't want you to be late for your next class."
 Spanish went about like I'd expected.
 There was a brief discussion on a new grammar concept, some vocabulary, and a whole lot of television.
 Britney caught up with me at my locker, still complaining that she was going to have to start doing her homework instead of trying to flirt with football players.
 "It's completely unfair.
 Nobody else's parents get called.
 It's like I'm back in grade school and have to deal with parent-teacher conference every month.
 I thought the whole point of high school was to give us the chance to start making some of our own decisions."
 I grunted something noncommittal as we turned the corner.
 It probably wouldn't have been good enough to save me from having to actually say something, but Brandon was leaning against a wall.

Jim – If he hadn’t then you would have never been born.
 Eugene – I know, it’s a paradox.
 Is it better to live, but to live through years of pain and misery?
 Or is it preferable never to have been born in the first place?
 Jim – That’s a hard one.
 I think I’ll go with having been born though.
 For me life is good, even when it’s a giant pain in the nether reigions.
 What do you think Johnny?
 Johnny – I choose C.

“We know council has bound you.” I waited for the next detail, my fingers curling into my palms.
 “And we know they must be the one or ones to unbind you.” Some part of me realized the seriousness of the conversation, but all I could do was listen.
 “They are, obviously… unwilling.” The breath I drew was too sharp.
 “I know some about the binding.
 I’ve studied it.” When he stopped, I said, “All right.” I didn’t know what he was getting at.
 “The problem is… meddling with the bindings, meddling with your mind is… well, it’s dangerous.” And there it was.
 “Dangerous,” I repeated.
 They let me consider that for a moment.
 They were being careful with me, didn’t want to upset me.
 I tried to ease them.

I am looking for one of two cars I believe they will be driving.
 Will it be the red Dodge Charger or the white Lexus sedan or perhaps a complete surprise?
 One way or the next, they know where I am and what I am driving and exactly where I am parked.
 I have met Ashley, so she should have no problem identifying me.
 I focus on the occupants of car after car.
 I am far too tense to be sleepy, but I am dazed by the constant parade of memories and possibilities that march through my head as I attempt to digest thousands of thoughts—hell bent on answering the question: Why do I sit here?
 It has been many years since I have been involved in a drug deal, and my assumption is that the process hasn’t changed much.
 My mother has been through too much pain and I can’t imagine what affect it would have on her to visit another family member in jail if things go badly tonight.
 I think about the deep secret I have now and what my mother would think, and those defining moments that led me here.

I kept the tears back until the door was shut, and then they came in a hot rush that left me depleted and sore.
 It was like Mom had already forgotten about the other half of our family.
 Chapter 2 The sound of my alarm pulled me from an uneasy sleep, full of dreams where I was running in terror from some unseen horror.
 I couldn't decide whether I was happy to be free of them, or mad I had to get up.
 My radio hadn't been in any of the boxes we'd unpacked last night, so I knew I'd have to get ready in silence.
 I forced myself out of bed regardless.
 Mom wouldn't be in to wake me up; she might not even be home.
 It still wasn't light by the time I finished showering.
 The fact that my body was, at least partly, still on Minnesota time should have helped, but the morning was just as unbearable as normal.
 Fighting back a yawn, I flipped on my bedroom light and examined the half-dozen boxes that might contain my clothes.

2.Establish macro-economic stability: The errors in earlier efforts at adjustment and stabilization have led some to argue for a series of compromise programmes that do not seriously ad dress the imminent dangers of hyperinflation and economic collapse.
 No transition strategy can be successful without first creating stable conditions for economic growth.
 No effort to improve agricultural production or the availability of food will be successful so long as the currency is not accepted as a stable means of exchange.
 This is the ultimate justification for the insistence of the international lending community on harsh measures to stabilize the economy.
 If the previous stabilization programmes have not proved politically viable, socially acceptable or economically effective, alternative programmes similar to the Yugoslav strategy must be attempted without further delay, backed by the full commitment of government.
 In some cases, it may be necessary to temporarily reintroduce controls on wages and prices as an interim measure to stop the free fall of the currency.
 But whatever the method, it is essential that this effort be combined with simultaneous implementation of other essential policies.
 3.Eliminate crop losses: In Russia and the other republics of the former USSR, highest priority in agriculture must be given to efforts that will increase the availability of food and reduce the huge crop losses and massive food imports.
 These losses vary by crop and region but average between 25 and 50 per cent of total field production for major crops.
 A reduction in crop losses could completely eliminate millions of tons of grain imports.

And her own drawings, little line drawings of dwarves and headless figures and skulls and djinns.
 And poems, typed and tacked to the wall.
 I remember one, in particular, an Aztec poem, and it began, “Rejoice, rejoice, my flower king, you own many jewels—“ and I thought, wow, that’s for me, man.
 It was an egotistical reaction, I know.
 Where “Flower King” comes from.
 And there were these little altars she had constructed, with tiny clay figures and candles.
 And the floor—what there was of it (laughs)—like I say, was awash in album covers and books.
 Books stacked in these tottering towers.
 Names I’d never heard of, at that time: Kis, Malcolm Lowry, Svevo, Madame Blavatsky, Fludd, Dee, Goncharov, Bruno Schulz, Philip Wylie, Whatsername Yates, Blake, Maturin, Borges, Marie-Louise von Franz,  a book called History of Secret Societies, one, I think called On the conjuring of angels.
 It was mind-boggling.

“Stay calm, and do not move from where you stand!” he shouted.
 The men quieted and listened to their commander.
 “I do not know what blessing we have received, but when it ends…”
 His voice drifted off.
 Movement behind his army caught his eye.
 He shoved a few men aside, tore through the center of his army, and then emerged at the back.
 Far down the street, his robe flowing in a nonexistent wind, walked a pale man dressed in black.
 His low hood covered all but the chin of his face.
 His gait was slow and steady.
 He kept one hand outstretched, and from it flowed a black river that branched out to form the shield that had kept the men alive.

While there was a bunch of fruit trees and berry bushes, most were the descendants of the original orchard and it was hard to find anything that reassembled a straight row.
 The apples trees were in fruit and they all started grabbing a few of each to eat as they went.
 Rodregas was not much of a farmer and did not know what the different types were named, but he liked the small green ones with the yellow splotches; they were sweet with a wonderful tang.
 “You know,” said Doi’van, “Hiding on a ley line definitely makes sense for keeping the Immortalists off our back and these apples are delicious.” Rodregas stared at him as he ate.
 Humans ate around the core, but Doi’van was eating the whole apple as he talked.
 “And I love the feel of all the magic.
 My body was meant to live in a place that has more magic than our world does, but the lines are chaotic.
 It is hard to sleep on a wild line.
 It is going to be hard to stay here for long.” Doi’van’s deep voice had the tone of making a simple observation, not conversation.
 Rodregas nodded; he had been waiting for the comment, but he had thought it would be Imeralda who brought it up.

"Did you enter the drawing for Les Misérables tickets?"
 I looked over to find Rachel sitting in the middle of the seat, happily leaning forward so she could talk to us.
 "Yes, but so did everyone else.
 My chances are so dismal they're not even worth mentioning."
 Rachel looked like she was going to argue, or say something cheerful, but the back of my mind had been trying to figure out how she could be even with us, but still sitting in the back seat.
 I did a quick check to verify my suspicion.
 "Rachel, you should be wearing your seatbelt."
 "Why?
 It isn't like anyone is going to pull us over and give us a ticket."
 It was more difficult than I expected to formulate a coherent answer while fighting off the first quivering indications of another attack.

I think that they’re still looking for me.
 Art – A lot of your stories seem to end like that.
 Eugene – Yeah they do, but I feel that running till I pass out and then hiding in a basement for a month, is a better way to end a story than ‘they tore my arm off and beat me with it’.
 Less pain, and the running is how I manage keep slim.
 Art – I’ve seen you eat two entire large pizzas, and then sit down on the couch and watch television until you fall asleep and not gain a pound, exercising can’t be much of a consideration for you.
 Eugene – Where did you think I burned off all those pizza calories?
 The Gym?
 Ha!
 I run, a lot, it’s kept me out of trouble on more times than I can count.
 Art – Well considering you can only count to ten that fact doesn’t impress me all that much.

The high rate of violence in Washington DC and other American cities, and the internecine conflicts of the Mafia and other criminal operations, all depend on the use of these deadly weapons, of which there are more than 200 million in the United States alone.
 Coping with this threat is made more difficult because, more often than not, such weapons in the hands of non-state actors, especially militants and terrorists, are superior to those available to security forces and law enforcement agencies of the state, and because detection and control of their distribution pose serious problems.
 No serious efforts are being made to stop this cancerous proliferation.
 In fact, many states have actively fostered proliferation as an instrument of their own policies.
 One of the most serious consequences of this trend is the linkage between small arms proliferation and the drugs trade.
 The use of and trade in narcotics represents a menace not only to the health and well-being of individuals and societies, but also to international security.
 The scale of the problem can be judged by the reported fact that Americans, who represent five per cent of the world’s population, consume fifty per cent of the world’s cocaine.
 In Pakistan, where there were virtually no drug addicts a decade ago, it has been reported that as many as 3 per cent of the population are addicted and thrice that number use drugs frequently.
 The CIS has now been added to the traditional drugs routes emanating from the Peru–Colombia–Panama, Pakistan–Afghanistan, and Myanmar–Thailand–Laos regions.
 The drugs menace is transnational in character with far-reaching implications for societal and international peace and security.

“I don’t know Jazell, they aren’t here.
 They’re just gone.” My stomach twisted into a knot.
 We had always been a group of four and now it was just the two of us.
 The ghost girl’s words came back to me.
 The four of you were chosen because of your unbreakable bond, but even that can be broken.
 You are strongest when you are together, but don’t let yourselves be separated.
 Kojas had separated us because he already knew that.
 The girl had warned us for a reason.
 She had known that Kojas was going to try to split us up into groups so that we would be weak.
 I watched Seth pace back and forth, nervously running his fingers through his hair and drumming the hilt of his sword.

To his dismay, he found her huddled in a corner of the sofa, still wearing her 1927 clothes.
 “Hi, sweetheart,” he greeted her, going to sit beside her.
 “Are you feeling better?” “I’m all right.” “I brought you something.”  He handed her a plastic bag.
 She took it and reached inside.
 “Wow!” she exclaimed as she withdrew the 16-ounce Hershey bar.
 “I’ve never seen a chocolate bar this big.” “Me either.
 It was part of a promotional display.” She tore it open, breaking off a chunk.
 “Mmm—this is so good.” He smiled.
 “Better be careful, or you’ll ruin your appetite for dinner.” “I’m starved—I didn’t have lunch.” His smile disappeared as he reached out to stroke her hair.
 “Have you been sitting here all day?” She nodded.

But Jesus in the night you are my nightlight.
 You are my nightlight.
 Good night, good night, good night.
 For several years, I wrote a weekly column for the San Diego Reader.
 The nominal topic was people and their cars.
 One story was about Olga: Lately even George Bush talks of conservation and cutting our reliance on middle east oil.
 So I’m convinced it’s time we ask ourselves if living more like Olga Savitsky wouldn’t be preferable to the way we are living.
 Olga is a minimalist.
 Though plenty educated (holding a Master of City Planning degree) and able to follow a more lucrative career, she chooses to work cleaning houses.
 She shares an apartment and pays less than $400 for rent and utilities, in a pleasant neighborhood near a commercial district.

She watched a strange creature fly over to her tree and hook itself on a branch near her.
 It looked like a butterfly with only one set of wings, which were transparent and seemed to glow.
 It had a tail and curled around the branch so it could rest its middle.
 Emily watched it and its beauty; she didn't think that something this pretty could be found in a place so dark and full of death.
 “Hello,” it said.
 Emily propped herself up on her elbow.
 “Hi, what are you?” “An augothas.” it replied and fluttered its wings.
 “Are you a half-ling?” “Yes, how did you know?
 Is it that obvious?” The augothas seemed to cock its head.
 “Well you can't be a faery because you don't have the ears and you can't be a pixie because they're always giggling around.

“A buffet?
 With lots of desserts?” He chuckled.
 “I know just the place.” Rick’s attentiveness calmed her, and she went to bed that night with a full stomach and an odd sense of security.
 Nothing about what had happened to her made sense, but Rick was right.
 If she had to walk out of 1927 into another time, she was fortunate she’d walked into his time.
 The week went by quickly.
 Marie always began the day with a walk in the garden, and Rick always hugged her and dried her tears when she returned.
 When he left for work, she'd exercise and watch movies he'd rented for her and clean the house with the supplies she'd discovered.
 In the evenings they'd eat and talk and watch TV, but he promised to take her to the shore Saturday.
 "The first thing we have to do is buy you a bathing suit," Rick told Marie as they strolled through the mall after dinner Friday evening.

His guess was that her connection with the forest had somehow warned her that something was coming.
 Doi’van and Rodregas looked at each other as they squatted down in the shrubs.
 Doi’van had one of the Black Yew bows out, with arrows at hand, if needed.
 It would not be surprising if a patrol of the Immortal Guard would be on the road.
 The road was the main route from the port city of Chrisana Stone to the Menagerie of Sky, Earth and Water; the slave city run by the Immortalist Taiga.
 Most likely what Imeralda sensed was simply a trade caravan running a regular route from Chrisana Stone to any of several of the Eastern Realms cities.
 If it was a light scouting patrol of just two or three guards that was coming; it would be the best case scenario for them to take on some Immortalist Guards and gain better weapons, armor and horses.
 Of course, if it was a slave caravan then they would simply sit and watch, as it would be suicide to do anything against a full patrol.
 Rodregas heard a rustle in the brush and glanced over to make sure it was just a squirrel or the like.
 He started to jump up as a humanoid shape appeared out of the trees, until he saw that it was just Imeralda.

 (Gets up and stumbles off stage)
 Cindy is waiting for the bus.
 Still dressed in summery type clothing.
 Still smiling and enjoying the weather.
 Greg walks up to her, looking unkempt and hunted.
 Greg: I’ve seen every episode of the twilight zone now.
 Cindy: hello
 Greg: I still haven’t been able to find the announcer.
 Cindy:  oh it’s absolutely beautiful.

My mom’s warnings could not deter me as I was a teenager and we all know teenagers are smarter than everyone else.
 I have a theory about teenagers; basically they could be walking off a cliff towards a canyon and you could yell and scream warnings all you want but your time would be better spent packing them a lunch so they could eat it on the way down.
 Numerous attempts to let Richard in our lives always ended in disaster.
 I know it is natural to want to know who your father is.
 Unfortunately sometimes he is a complete jerk.
 Richard is just not a good person; actually he is quite the opposite.
 It was difficult for me to discover that my father’s lifelong friends didn’t even know he had sons.
 Besides being an alcoholic his whole life, I found out he was a first rate con-man.
 He was a womanizer, with a taste for young girls, and a big time loser.
 When I did try to let him into our lives, he was verbally abusive to me, my wife and even my children.

The tension grew.
 A group of men, not daring to admit where their pay came from, built sturdy palisades between the two halves of town.
 Everyone knew why but none spoke of it, at least outside of a whisper.
 Two weeks after Harruq and Qurrah had slaughtered the messenger from Veldaren, the burning lights of an army encampment filled the fields north of Woodhaven.
 Soldiers of Neldar had arrived.

 Antonil Copernus was quiet as he gazed at the town.
 The wind teased his long blond hair, never letting it rest as he stood.
 The moonlight cast an eerie glow on his gold-tinted armor, which was carefully polished.

Then Billy Graham came to town.
 The Light
 While working at Coffee Dan's, on breaks Cliff and I consorted with the waitresses.
 Reba, a truck stop veteran, had eyes for Cliff, though she was twice his age.
 She was toying with his hair when sweet Helga came in and gasped.
 She fetched a Bible from her cubby and read aloud, “Her lips drip honey, but in the end she is a bitter fruit.
 Her steps lead straight to the grave.” Reba laughed and sat in the chair between Cliff and me.
 She arched her back so her breasts swelled.
 “Helga, last night I took your advice.
 I said, ‘God, help me out here.

I made an effort to consider possible responses in my head, but was coming up blank.
 The nerves were gone.
 I found myself wanting Steed to win and leaned with his strikes, tensing as if they were my own.
 Grey bounded through the air once more, showing off, confident in his evident lead, and then a small rock rose at chest height in front of Steed.
 I was trying to figure out who had lifted it when Grey flashed back into view, hesitating only a moment as he considered the rock.
 At once, his face changed; he knew he’d been beaten.
 As he’d paused to study the floating rock, Steed had immobilized him and, just like that, the match was over.
 Ruby leaned into me, voice soft.
 “Steed is stronger than Grey.
 He only needed to catch him.” Grey conceded, his walk slower, movements no longer jerky as he made his way out of the makeshift ring.

I kept looking at the clock, and the later it got, the more certain I was that Principal Gossil was just about to get on the loudspeaker and call out the winners of the drawing.
 The last two minutes of lunch dragged on forever, but then the bell rang and I was left sitting stunned as Brandon and his friends stood to go.
 I let Brandon help me to my feet, hardly noticing the way his touch left my hand tingling, and headed off to class.
 It was stupid, but I couldn't help feeling this was yet another sign I wasn't going to win a ticket.
 I tried to shake the feeling during History, but was still fighting it when I walked into Physics.
 In a departure from his normal routine, Alec was already seated when I arrived.
 I flipped open my notebook and tried to distract myself with a brief sketch, only to tear the page out and ball it up as the bell rang.
 I looked up to see Alec staring at me, which just made me mad.
 It was completely unfair.
 I wasn't going to get to go to Les Misérables, but he was rich enough to fly to New York and book the whole theater.

"Just wait.
 If one of these set-ups ever works out, you'll see what it's like when your wife hounds you to pump your best friend for information."
 "That really inspires me to want to get married."
 The phone rang, and Ted left as Rick picked it up.
 “Ward and Lee Realty.” “Hi.
 What’re you doing?” “Working.
 How come you’re not?”  His sister Teri was an office manager in Charlestown.
 “I am.
 I meant to call you last night and forgot.
 I wanted to tell you about a party we’re having in two weeks, and I don’t want you to say I didn’t give you time to find a date.” “Who—you and Jeremy?” “No—it’s a benefit for the children’s hospital.”  She was on the board.

He sat up, arranging his pillows behind him.
 "That looks great."
 She was happy when he began eating with gusto.
 "What are we going to do today?"
 "I don't know.
 Whatever you want."
 She smiled.
 "Go to the shore again?"
 He groaned, pulling the blanket just low enough for her to be able to compare the skin his swimming trunks had covered with the red skin above it.
 "I don't want to even see the sun."

Sadness, not just disappointment over Hollywood—-because she'd miss Rick.
 "Afraid of what?"
 Rick stroked her cheek with his thumb.
 "Hmmm?
 Oh.
 Nothing."
 Standing on tiptoe, she kissed his cheek.
 "I'll go change clothes and be right back."
 She wished she could wear her sneakers, she mused as she roamed through the garden in her bulky black shoes.
 But she couldn't very well walk into her house wearing shorts and sneakers.

“Can you help Emily, she's trying to release the trapped dragon,” I whispered to him.
 Jason nodded.
 “Will do Jazell.” He stood up and walked over to Emily.
 I sat on the ground next to Seth.
 His eyes were closed and he looked dead.
 His blue hair was ruffled up in all directions.
 I was so sure that he might be dead that I placed a hand on his chest, feeling for a heartbeat.
 I felt the steady thump under my fingers and I sighed in relief.
 I removed my hand and looked over at Emily.
 They had freed the dragon and they both were petting its head.

"You didn't think I'd forget, did you?"
 "Not forget, no, just maybe be a little late."
 As abruptly as that, the interplay between the two siblings ended, leaving an uncomfortable silence as odd as the affection from a moment before.
 We walked to Alec's car in silence, the pair of them apparently lost in their own thoughts, and me wondering why Alec had agreed to give me a ride home.
 I wasn't enough of a car aficionado to recognize the vehicle other than the fact that it was a matte gray and had the kind of smooth, exotic lines all of the high-end vehicles seemed to be striving for right now.
 Rachel slipped in the backseat while I was still wondering how this seemingly low-profile ride matched up against Brandon's Mustang.
 "Did you enter the drawing for Les Misérables tickets?"
 I looked over to find Rachel sitting in the middle of the seat, happily leaning forward so she could talk to us.
 "Yes, but so did everyone else.
 My chances are so dismal they're not even worth mentioning."

"This is fun.
 Why don't we get you one of these?"
 After buying Rick a baja, they bought a multi-colored blanket and a leather purse.
 Marie loved bargaining, but the only other thing she saw that she wanted was a little glass carousel that she managed to get from ten dollars down to five.
 "Can't we eat here somewhere, Rick?
 I'd like to try the food."
 "No, you wouldn't," he said as they approached customs.
 "The water down here is contaminated.

 "What?"

Instead, he wanted to see what kind of training Doi’van had.
 But he had never been able to turn down a beautiful woman.
 “Sure,” he said walking back to the barn and the wagon.
 Rodregas jumped on the back, making the wagon squeal in alarm at his weight, and opened ‘his’ trunk and pulled out the last blanket left in it, the one he had wrapped the books up in.
 Rodregas unrolled the blanket on the back of the now mostly empty wagon showing the dozen books that he had saved from Ravenhurr’s library.
 Imeralda reached out for one of the closest, but then stopped as her fingers touched them, as if a spark of lightning had hit her.
 Obviously, she could feel that same power Rodregas had.
 That was interesting.
 She then ran her hand from one to the next until she had touched all twelve books.
 Then, she looked up and her expression reminded Rodregas of some girl who had gotten the perfect mid winter gift that she had been dreaming of.

I don’t pry, so I can’t be sure what goes on inside him, but I have no reason to think he believes in God, or that he doesn’t.
 But whether he believes or not, Cliff has gotten well blessed since our evening with Billy Graham.
 He has four wonderful kids, and Toni, who is one of those rarest of people who appear to grow brighter, stronger, and more beautiful every year.
 Cliff and Billy's dad, Cliff Senior, invited me to dinner not many years ago.
 The evening became an in vino veritas experience.
 After some cups, he said, “Ken, you should know it was me that hounded my son into serving in Vietnam.” I held back from saying, Yeah, I know.
 “So he goes over there, fighting in a war that was all wrong, and he saw things nobody should have to.
 He comes back drinking hard.
 And then, thank God, he met Toni.” The man from whom Cliff and Bill Torrey inherited their reserved and stoic characters snuffed and wiped his eyes.
 “I’ll tell you, that girl saved my son’s life.

I must be out of my mind not to run for the hills."
 "You don't like it when I spend money on you and the more involved you get with me the less likely it is I'll be able to protect you."
 "If I let you buy me something will you quit trying to scare me off?"
 "No, but it would make me feel better."
 He said that last with his heart stopping blue eyes gazing directly into mine and I nearly stopped breathing.
 Somehow he hadn't realized yet that when he looked at me like that there wasn't anything I could deny him.
 "Ok, you can get me a present, something small and relatively inexpensive."
 Alec smiled and reached over to the backpack as he sat up.
 I let him pull me up and then felt my face freeze as he pulled out one of the largest velvet boxes I'd ever seen.
 "Alec, no."

I will answer a question of yours every time that you answer one of mine.” Van’dret expression darkened and he almost hissed his outrage, “You would bargain with me, with your life held by a string?” For some strange reason that Rodregas was sure reflected a very deep character flaw, he felt his face break out in a very large toothy grin as he said, “And I have what to lose?” Van’dret stared at him for several long minutes before he shrugged and said, “Very well, ask me your question, but then you will answer mine or you die.” Rodregas simply nodded.
 He had no lack of questions, but was not sure which to ask first.
 He decided going small first would cause a less violent reaction.
 Rodregas said, “How did you find us down here?” Van’dret’s expression at the question was like he had asked why is the sky blue.
 He nearly sneered his answer, “Through magic, of course, a simple tracking spell.” Van’dret did not go small, “Are you three responsible for the death of the Immortalist Sorcerer Ravenhurr?” “Yes and no,” responded Rodregas.
 He almost left it at that, but decided to continue, “I killed Ravenhurr during the Ceremony of Ascension.
 I threw him into his own consuming flames.
 The other two I did not meet until afterwards.” At Rodregas’ response Van’dret stared at him, “You killed an Immortalist Sorcerer by yourself in his tower?
 You truly claim that?” Rodregas almost laughed.
 He did chuckle a bit as he said, “First, you want me to admit that I killed an Immortalist Sorcerer, and when I do, you don’t believe me.

When I go back, I'll be miserably lonely for you.
 But if I were to stay here, I'd miss my family, my home, my roots.
 I'd feel misplaced.
 I'd worry about my family and how upset they are and how they'd always wonder what had happened to me."
 She took her toothbrush and put toothpaste on it.
 "I understand.
 But that doesn't make it any easier."
 Tossing his washcloth into the clothes basket, he picked up a brush, and when she straightened after having brushed her teeth, he began smoothing her hair with long, slow strokes.
 Marie closed her eyes, tears seeping from them.
 She stood still for as long as she could, but finally, unable to bear the tenderness of his touch, she turned around and took the brush from him.

In the open central area, he saw both the small carriage and the supply wagon that Ravenhurr used for traveling and carry supplies back and forth to the keep.
 He looked at it and smiled.
 With the carriage horses and wagon he could strip a lot of useful items out of the keep.
 He went next door to the smith’s and started gathering up tools, and loading them up into the smith’s travel trunk.
 The nicest tools were in a cabinet, and with a grunt (it was heavy even for him) he picked it up and loaded it into the cart, along with some other useful implements.
 He would need to carry as much food as possible as well.
 He quickly went back into the main keep and wrapped up the mattress from Captain Poir’s bunk and started carrying barrels of flour and other foodstuffs to his pile next to the front entrance.
 The drudge stared at him with a strange look but did not question his actions.
 He then realized that he should go up and check out the laboratory for anything else of value, and check out the dungeon to make sure all the prisoners had been freed.
 He had brought a proper crow bar from his visit to the smith’s and made short work of the laboratory door.

For maybe the first time I'd ever seen, Jessica was happy.
 She seemed completely in her element, utterly oblivious to the number of people watching her every move, and I felt just a little of my resentment dissolve.
 "You're all such good dancers.
 How did that happen?"
 Alec released my waist and spun me out and back in without missing a single step.
 I wished I could be so lucky, only the fact that his arm was like an iron bar allowed me to keep my misstep from resulting in a fall, or possibly a sprained ankle.
 "Donovan has very inflexible standards when it comes to some things.
 Dancing happens to be one of them.
 In fact, I don't think I'll ever forget the expression on Jasmin's face when he told her she could go clubbing all she wanted after he judged her suitably proficient in real dancing.
 He said he wouldn't have her 'seduced by throbbing beats and soulless contact' before he'd at least exposed her to proper dance steps."

Together they encompass the two basic components of all development personal and institutional, individual and collective.
 The challenge is to develop simultaneously both individual and social capacities and utilize their potentials in a complementary manner.
 For the individual, development involves acquisition of greater know ledge, more progressive attitudes, improved skills and higher values.
 For the collective, development involves establishment of more useful and productive institutions, systems, organizations and cultural values.
 The conventional view that development is essentially a function of scarce economic inputs must give way to the perception that the opportunities and potentials for rapid development far exceed actual achievements in every country.
 Looking back over the past few decades, we realize that the speed of social progress could certainly have been much greater than it was.
 The tremendous potential for accelerating development is most easily illustrated by in stances in which actual achievements substantially excelled expectations, such as the enormous leap in world agriculture during the 1960s and 1970s and the phenomenal growth of incomes, employment and exports in East Asia during the last ten years.
 These unforeseen accomplishments reflect the magnitude of potentials that these countries possessed but had not previously utilized.
 The untapped resources of the society can be categorized under several headings:
 Knowledge of the process of development and the factors that stimulate it.

Rodregas had an urge to leap from his branch to the other like a cat.
 Maybe he could have made it, but if he missed it was at least a hundred feet down.
 So he climbed the bark over to the other branch and then walked on the top, which was very easy.
 He followed Imeralda out on the branch until it started getting thin and began swaying.
 Then he sat on the branch.
 He did not know what to do next.
 His body relaxed when he heard Imeralda’s voice.
 “Are you trying to kill me?” she asked, “and are you really trying to rescue a Forest Nymph from a tree?” The laughter that followed was pure and open and even he had to laugh with it.
 “So,” he asked, “what are you doing?” “Well, I decided that if this was a greater sigil I should touch it.
 Even though I do not want a greater sigil to consume my magic, this is the One Tree.

"Why?
 It isn't like anyone is going to pull us over and give us a ticket."
 It was more difficult than I expected to formulate a coherent answer while fighting off the first quivering indications of another attack.
 "She's right, Rachel.
 You should be buckled in."
 I expected her to argue with him.
 No girl on the planet liked it when her older brother sided with her friends against her, but Rachel just frowned a little before scooting back so she could do up her seatbelt.
 Was she really that scared of him?
 I stole a glance at him out of the corner of my eye.
 He didn't look threatening, well, at least no more so than usual.

"Fine.
 I'm doing the laundry."
 "I have a blue shirt hanging on the bathroom doorknob--" "I found it.
 It's in the dryer."
 "Thanks--you're terrific.
 Listen, I called to tell you that I may be a little late tonight."
 "Why?"
 "I have a lot of things to wrap up before the weekend.
 But I have a surprise for you that'll make up for it."
 "It will have to be a really special surprise."

And then it occurred to me.
 The horse.
 I had thought he had shown up because I’d impressed upon him to follow before I blacked out, but I had already been bound again at that point.
 Should I tell Chevelle?
 I didn’t know why I felt so protective of this secret.
 Chevelle drew a section of moss from one of the stones on the wall and it replaced the pebble.
 “Try this.
 They shouldn’t have bothered binding you from growing.” I concentrated on it.
 Nothing.
 But I was never good at that anyway.

The only thing that's kept me sane has been your behind-the-scenes help.
 I want to stay with you.
 I want to be with you."
 Alec studied me for a moment longer, and then nodded, a short, choppy motion with little if any of his usual grace.
 "Very well then.
 It's just after ten o'clock.
 Your mom is about to pull into the driveway.
 Do your best to convince her you spent the night safely at home.
 We'll stay here and watch over the two of you.
 Also, if you can convince her it's safe to leave on an extended trip, that would be very helpful.

“Oh but you will care, half-ling.” The dwarf was now whispering and all the others had fallen silent so they could hear.
 “You will care because in the end, he will destroy you once he’s done using you.” My arms were still tense and my muscles whined in protest as I held my arrow back in full draw.
 “Use me to do what?” I spoke, using the same tone as him.
 The dwarf’s eyes were twinkling in happiness.
 He seemed happy to tell me the answer.
 “To take over the gift-less ones’ world, why else half-ling?
 You’re the connection between Igneeria and your world.
 He needs you and he has made that clear.” The world had fallen to silence.
 I spoke in barely a whisper, “Igneeria, that’s your world isn’t it?
 What does Kojas want?” The dwarf seemed to be getting extremely excited now, “He wants your world and all other worlds because he is a mighty king who wishes to expand his kingdom.” “So how would we help him do that?” I asked, stalling.

He weaved it through the air, his mouth agape at the ease in which it glided.
 “They are not as long as your previous weapons,” Velixar said, “but you will adjust.
 These blades will make you faster and more skillful than ever before.
 Forget everything you know about yourself, and know only that you are unstoppable.”
 Harruq took the other sword and held both in his hands.
 He noticed the writing that flared on each hilt, one red, the other gold.
 “What do they say?” he asked, staring at them in wonder.
 “Condemnation and Salvation.
 You are judgment, Harruq.
 May it be swift and merciless.”

She watched as Harruq struggled through some sort of internal debate.
 His brown eyes finally rose to meet hers.
 “Qurrah’s like you, but not.
 You can cast magic right?” Aurelia nodded.
 “Well, he can too.
 But he…‌ he’s different.
 When we were kids, he found a little mouse.
 It was dead as dead can be.
 He closed his hands around it, just like this, and then whispered some words he learned from secretly watching Master.”
 “Master?” Aurelia asked, interrupting him again.

I smiled at Rachel and then flipped open my math book.
 Everything went just like normal, and promptly at five I closed my binder and started stuffing books into my backpack.
 I looked up to find Rachel standing in front of my table.
 "Are you ready?
 James had to leave early, but don't worry, we've still got a ride home."
 I think I managed to keep the disappointment off of my face.
 Rachel at least didn't seem to notice.
 Somehow I'd lost track of the fact that it was a Wednesday, and Brandon therefore wouldn't be taking me home.
 "Great.

It seemed as if he feared that if he moved, his inclusion in the discussion would be challenged.
 Jordaan, apparently satisfied with their attention, continued “Our ability to manipulate the sources of mana seems to be a relationship of our blood connection to a realm.
 Mortals, to a greater or lesser extent; have an ability to tap into the mana that has overflowed into our realm from the Celestial, Infernal and Elemental Realms.
 I, for one, believe that if our connections to these realms were cut,” Jordaan made a motion like knife cutting a loaf of bread, “that in a few years there would not be enough magic for us to use.” “Luckily, I can think of no way for such a thing to happen.
 But a mortal’s ability to use mana that has spilled into the mortal world is very limited.
 The Immortalists have overcome this limitation by incorporating certain people’s direct connection to these realms.
 “So,” Jordaan continued, “if a mortal can add a Celestial’s ability to directly tap the Celestial power, he becomes far stronger.
 If the magic user can also tap into the Elemental powers, he again becomes far more powerful.
 Of course, the end goal of the Immortalists is to become a god.
 There are limitations; if an Immortalist were to incorporate a celestial ant’s connection to the Celestial, he would gain in power.

I’d been staring right at him and had no idea where he’d gone.
 I was just beginning to doubt whether I’d seen him at all when I spotted him standing across the circle, grinning fiendishly while he dangled an object from his hands.
 It was the feather Ruby had tied in my hair.
 I’d forgotten about it.
 I reached up to feel for it and it was gone.
 I started to get irritated but then the feather was in my other hand and he was back, his hands now empty.
 And then, for no apparent reason but amusement, he did a few somersaults and landed in the center of the circle, smiling.
 I could only shake my head as Ruby clapped beside me, clearly thrilled with the show.
 I thought I must have missed something.
 Grey bowed out of the circle and was replaced by the two tall, silvery elves.

Rodregas stepped out of his room which, unlike a normal room in a human house opened directly outside.
 He ducked under a branch and bolted through the two trees and through a bush and to the door to Doi’van’s room.
 Doi’van was standing up, his walking stick up ready to fight at Rodregas’ bellow.
 “What alarms you?” he asked.
 He seemed to be listening for attack.
 “These bastards are trying to take our armor and swords!
 We nearly died because it was the right thing to do to rescue the Nymphs, especially with the children being part of the caravan.” Rodregas added in a growl, “There were probably Dire steeds as well.” “By the Infernal Daemons, I might be as strong as a Celestial Lion, but we are going to get chopped to little pieces until we have decent armor and weapons.” “But why would they keep the armor?” growled Doi’van.
 “These people do not seem to be warriors.
 What good would it do them?” Doi’van tossed his wild black mane of hair and his eyes lighted with rage.
 Rodregas suddenly realized that he better not feed the Hellborn’s rage.

I couldn’t seem to stop.
 My mouth opened to speak once more but I was suddenly swept up, off Steed’s lap and into Chevelle’s arms.
 I managed fear for half a second but then lost the feeling to dizziness, followed quickly by only dull numbness.
 Chevelle was laying me on my bed.
 “Stay here.
 It will pass.” His words were gentle now, the anger gone.
 “I’m sorry,” I whispered.
 He didn’t respond.
 He leaned over me to straighten the bedding, his face close to mine.
 I stared at his mouth, wondering briefly what it might taste like.

she gasped.
 "Just wait until we're above the clouds.
 They look like a bed of cotton."
 She was quiet until they were flying through the clouds.
 "They don't look like cotton.
 I can't see anything--how can the pilot see where he's going?"
 "He has instruments to help him.
 We'll only be in them for a minute.
 Then you'll see what I mean."
 She did, marveling at the beauty of perfectly clear blue skies above and white powder puffs below.

"I've been thinking about the fact that I didn't really give you young people a chance to ask any questions that might have come up during the course of your work on our section regarding light.
 Now's your chance, please ask away.
 If I don't know the answer, I'm sure that together we can find an adequate explanation for whatever you might have come across."
 The class was quiet for several seconds, before a hand finally shot up.
 I could have predicted who it would be.
 Every class has at least one teacher's pet.
 Some of the kids end up that way because they have this bizarre thirst for knowledge, some go that route because they like to make everyone else look stupid.
 Sammy was in the latter group.
 She'd probably been saving a question about light since we'd started the unit.
 Just in case an opportunity presented itself to earn some brownie points.

We were teenagers and we had these other guys, girls, coming up to us, asking about Dickinson and what I meant by “hoodoo on the bloody muddy” or some shit, something they heard on the album.
 It was weird.
 But, you know, I was kind of lost at that time—this was right before Lor came into my life—and I had all these groupies, all these chicks, and I’d ball them, right?, but really I’d be thinking about the music, about what’s next, musically, about soloing, about getting my axe to sound like a sax.
 I was way gone on the music, man, and it just shoved everything out of me, everything else.
 I didn’t know then, that I was unraveling, like an old sweater.
 I mean, I loved the chicks, you know, I loved them.
 But, they knew I was nowhere man, after we’d do it and I’d be lying there, I’d be a million miles away and they’d get this sad look.
 In the morning they’d be all like, let’s go to Barksdale’s for breakfast, and, well, I was using some speed at the time and my appetite was nil.
 So, they’d go off and I’d pick up the guitar.
 That’s just the way I was then.

Probably because I didn’t sleep enough, my emotions had shut down, and every day I sensed impending doom.
 Something had to change.
 My kids didn’t deserve a catatonic dad.
 One late afternoon as I sat on the grass at the University of San Diego, overlooking the harbor and wondering how I could fix my emotions, I mumbled, “Okay, where should I start?” Then I remembered advice Master Jeong, our Tae Kwon Do instructor, often gave.
 He told us, "Everything begins with the spirit.
 From the spirit come the thoughts.
 From the thoughts come the actions.
 From the actions come the habits.
 From the habits comes the character.
 And from the character comes the destiny.” Stupefied by stress as I was, I sat a while wondering where on that continuum I should start trouble-shooting, until the obvious made itself clear.

It opened up an insular society and exposed it to an avalanche of new information, new ideas and new possibilities, which released a fervent aspiration in the people for a better life.
 Over the last few years, democratization has been especially dynamic in Africa, where it has been dubbed Africa’s Second Liberation.
 During the first three decades of post-colonial independence, almost all of the continent’s 54 states had come under either single-party or military rule.
 The preference for authoritarian rule was often justified by the need for rapid economic development, which could be impeded by opposition to government policies and by the need to contain regional and tribal conflicts.
 Neither of these claims has proven true.
 Living standards have actually declined in most African countries during the last two decades.
 Regional and tribal politics have flourished.
 Dozens of civil and inter-state wars have been fought, accounting for millions of lost lives.
 Food production and employment have lagged far behind population growth.
 In the absence of legal channels of protest, opposition parties have frequently resorted to violence.

 Mrs. Tranton managed to maintain a pensive expression for a few seconds but then smiled at her daughter.
 "Yes.
 And I think a September wedding would be perfect."
 They discussed bridesmaids and flowers and gardens.
 Marie would wear her mother's wedding gown, which had been carefully stored away for the last 28 years.
 Marie's grandmother had worn it as well, and when Marie took it off after her own wedding, it would go into storage for her daughter.
 Davis chose the next day to approach her father.
 "Come in, my boy," Jefferson Tranton told him, waving the young man into a large, comfortable chair opposite his own in his den.
 "You seemed rather anxious when you telephoned last night."

Even if it was, it wouldn't matter because spending the last two weeks with you would've been more than worth the price."
 Chapter 29 The dress hadn't entirely been real inside my mind.
 Even after Rachel finally admitted she'd purchased the dress from our Vegas trip, and had it sent here, it'd been hard to believe I was really going to be wearing it at the dance.
 It was hard to still be disbelieving when it was hanging from the door just a few feet from me, but I was giving the effort my best shot.
 Its green, silky beauty seemed to be mocking me.
 There was no way I was going to be able to pull off a dress like that.
 Even assuming it didn't fall off of me, I was still going to look like a walrus.
 "Stop fidgeting, Adri.
 It's just a dance, not a funeral, and if you don't hold still your makeup isn't going to turn out right."
 Rachel poked me in the ribs, and then went back to work on the last few details of my 'new and improved' look.

Next to the open windows was a very nice desk with a very comfortable looking chair; next to the fireplace were several larger overstuffed and even more comfortable looking chairs.
 There were not as many books as Rodregas had thought there would be; only one wall was covered in shelves and miscellaneous piles of scrolls and other items.
 Next to the desk there was a fancy set of shelves with glass covers to protect them.
 He went over to the glass enclosed shelves; the books looked richly made but old.
 Books of sorcery would sell very well indeed.
 The glass covers were locked, so again he muffled the sound with the blanket and forced the cabinet doors open.
 With each cabinet door the glass broke.
 He tried to open the cabinet doors without breaking the glass.
 But, whatever magic locks were in force were just too secure.
 So, he had to use brute strength to shatter the doors one by one.

We could hear him approaching the bedroom as the volume of his voice increased.
 We watched through the slats in the closet door as he would open her dresser drawers and rummage through her belongings, including her undergarments, while looking around over his shoulder, still yelling her name.
 Eventually, he would leave and somehow mom would come up with the rent to keep a roof over our heads for another month.
 We were getting old enough to know that we were different than most families in many ways, but we always knew we had a loving mother.
 Thomas and I also knew that the only other consistent thing in our life was each other.
 We were very close in size and we were often mistaken as twins although I had blond hair and he had brown.
 We fought like all brothers did, but we had always shared a bedroom and we talked each other to sleep every night.
 I never remember my mother dating much, so I think she was careful not to introduce us to any suitor until it was more serious.
 She eventually met a man who she was serious about, Dino.
 He would sometimes bring food we were not accustomed to eating, like steak.

And he wasn't nearly as handsome as Rick.
 Rick had beautiful blue eyes and-and a broad, muscular chest that she got to see every morning if she woke up before he did.
 In her dreams, he never had on a shirt, and he was always smiling.
 That dream might change now.
 Right now the image in her mind was of his face as it had come closer and closer to hers.
 She'd wanted him to kiss her.
 But she was going to marry Davis--she couldn't kiss another man!
 "Are you hungry, honey?"
 Rick asked when "I Love Lucy" went off.
 "No.

 I mean, a new species.
 A new breed.
 And lethal.
 Poison to her mother.
 They couldn’t even know that was what had happened until the others.

Just before I left elementary school someone had read us a newspaper article about some poor guy being pushed over a railing and falling to his death.
 I'd had nightmares for months.
 Dreams where the stairs had turned slick and I'd slid all the way down them.
 Dreams where the banister hadn't even been there and the stairs had become impossibly narrow, and nightmares where I'd somehow stumbled and started to fall over the edge of the railing.
 This was like all of those dreams put together, only happening to someone else.
 A couple of kids reached out, but the only people who could've really stopped him had already been bowled over.
 Time slowed down for me as he hit the railing and started over it.
 His feet came up and his torso was hanging in the void when someone reached over and grabbed his arm.
 I heard a grunt of effort, saw him stop moving, and only then realized it was Ben who'd nearly died.
 In the split second between Ben being gently placed back on the stairs, and everyone starting to breathe again, I followed the arm that'd saved him back to see who the hero was.

I thought I recognized Chevelle’s voice and tried to focus on it, to understand the agony.
 “Frey,” he said, and something brushed my cheek, warm and feather light.
 The distant impression that it might have been the brush of lips had me drawing in a sharp breath, and I coughed, gasping to fill my lungs.
 The air shifted as those surrounding me moved in response.
 I forced my eyes open and found Ruby, Steed, and Chevelle.
 They looked for a moment as if they were suffering my pain… and then I realized the pain was gone, the siren was silenced.
 My breathing steadied, the fear abating, and their faces relaxed.
 Relief washed their expressions, but their postures remained stiff, alert.
 I pushed up to find the source of the danger and dizziness incapacitated me.
 They rushed to kneel beside me and I could see that was how they had been before my gasp had moved them to standing.

Help me, so I don’t do something out of order, hurt myself?” His eyebrows drew down, coming together as he began his reply, but a fallen branch cracked at the edge of the clearing and his head snapped toward it.
 I sucked in a harsh breath as Chevelle strode toward us.
 The elf who had been sitting with me was now in a fiercely protective stance in front of me.
 I leaned around him to see, placing my hand on his leg as I angled my head past it.
 That broke his stare and he glanced down at me.
 I watched Chevelle, still walking casually toward us, as if there weren’t two angry panthers preparing to pounce on him.
 But I must have appeared about as threatening as a kitten, because the leg I was gripping shook with laughter.
 My angry gaze turned on my new acquaintance and he raised his hands in surrender, still chuckling.
 “I take it you know him?” he asked.
 “He’s following me,” I announced, too loud.

A place as bright as Sun, as holy as Stax.
 It is where Black Lung was born.
 Today it is a Taco Bell.
 But some know.
 Some still pass it by and cross themselves, hearken back to the days of divination, the days when music could save a dying nation, a nation bent on its own self-immolation.
 That was the sixties.
 Even in Memphis, an outpost planet.
 A tributary, if you will.
 That first session, so it is told, was as if energy itself had been created in that concrete empty shell, where grass pushed through the floor, straining to catch these new vibes, this new electrical Jubal.
 Buddy cut loose as if he had been formerly playing in a straightjacket.

I examined their wide noses, rounded ears, and stubby fingers.
 Those who wore no shoes had short, thick toes like trolls.
 The men had patches of hair curled on their chests and forearms and some even grew it around their chins like goats.
 Their clothes were tattered and ill-fitting rags.
 They moved about the camp slowly.
 Clearly they had no magic, and they definitely were the owners of the crude tools we had found.
 They spoke to each other often, their voices like the protest of an old hound.
 I watched until nightfall, when they settled into tents and lean-tos.
 They seemed to assign a watchman, wielding only a torch lit from the central fire.
 I slipped down from the tree and returned to the castle.

He showed me nothing but kindness.”
 “Then it is a false kindness,” Dieredon said.
 He paused for a moment, grabbed his chest with his healthy arm, and then looked at her again.
 Pain was evident in his eyes.
 “That man has an army of undead.
 I barely managed to hide until daylight.
 Woodhaven is in danger, and so are you.”
 Aurelia stepped back, frowning.
 “Are you sure it was Harruq?”
 “I saw the warrior with my own eyes.

Saucy at ten.
 Hey, that’s a great song title.
 Wait a minute.
 Ok, yeah, so I was playing this Elvis song for my friends and some teacher heard it and blew a gasket.
 (laughs)   I mean, I guess “Baby, let’s play house,” is not something you expect a little boy to sing to a little girl.
 And I got my uke taken from me and a call was made to my parents.
 My mom hit the roof—she was the kind that got embarrassed by such things and that, to her, was the ultimate disgrace, to be shown up in front of other grownups.
 My mom threatened to smash my uke and Dad had to cool her down and, I think, it was later that night I got it back.
 I started right in, learning new songs.
 Thinking up new songs.

Chapter 28 Alec was completely drenched in sweat, and I still wanted to throw myself at him so badly my teeth hurt.
 It shouldn't be possible for someone to look so good dressed in what amounted to little more than loose, extra-stretchy sweatpants.
 "How was training?"
 It was hard to sound casual.
 The urge to kiss him had become almost overpowering in the last few days.
 He knew me better on every level imaginable than anyone outside my immediate family ever had, and all I could think about right now was how much I wanted to touch him.
 "Fairly well, all things considered.
 We took it easy though..." I'd gotten used to the idea that he left a substantial number of thoughts unsaid out of a desire to protect me from knowing too much.
 I didn't like it, but I'd learned to accept it.
 He didn't need to finish that particular sentence though.

She watched as the actors climbed towers, rode hand trolleys on cables, jumped from shattered platforms into the water.
 And when the heroine shot the villain, causing his jacket to catch on fire, Marie screamed.
 It was so real, and she gripped the edge of her seat as she waited to see what would happen after he fell into the water.
 The villain jumped up on the platform to make his bows with the rest of the cast.
 Marie raised wide eyes to Rick's face as they stood to leave.
 "Was that man who was on fire hurt?"
 "No.
 He'll do another show in a couple of hours."
 "How do they do that?"
 "The jacket is made out of some kind of special material."

The symbols on his body faded until they were but faint scars.
 “Give him his clothes,” Velixar ordered his student.
 Qurrah fetched a pair of black pants, a red shirt, and a black cloak, all of which Velixar had prepared before the brothers had brought the bloodless body to him.
 “Dress,” the necromancer ordered.
 Ahrqur growled some inane argument, but a glare from Velixar sent him cowering.
 “You must obey my every command, wretch, before you may return to the peaceful death you left.
 Fight me and you shall find your stay here lasting longer than your rotting body’s.”
 The undead Ahrqur whimpered.
 Qurrah watched the display, fighting against feelings of jealousy.
 He had commanded Ahrqur’s spirit to speak truthfully, but Velixar’s very glare sent him groveling to his knees.

We'll escort you to school, stay just long enough to ensure we don't get in trouble, and then hurry back to our territory.
 At least if Brandon's pack does come after us there, we're within our rights to do something about it."
 I opened my mouth to comment on the fact that Brandon's pack was roughly twice the size of ours, only to realize that scurrying back home kind of precluded continuing to help out at the tutor lab.
 "What about helping Mrs.
 Campbell?"
 It shouldn't have surprised me that Alec thought it over for several seconds before shaking his head.
 Whatever else he was, he wasn't the thoughtless jerk Brandon had proven himself to be.
 "I'm sorry, Adriana.
 I wish we could, for Rachel's sake as well as yours, but it's just too risky.
 Fewer witnesses means more chance Brandon's people will try to arrange for something to happen.

 BG:  	Naw, it wasn’t that simple.
 I mean, Lorelei reached down into the cosmic soup and pulled me out.
 But I was still a mess, you know?
 I was wrung out, without hope or talent or release.
 I was limp, like a rope, see, like a rope that formerly held such tension, then snapped—I was that rope.

Oh.
 Oh, no.
 No, no, no.
 My head cleared, but Chevelle still held me around the arms.
 My neck flushed, my eyes shooting to my lap.
 I couldn’t look at him.
 What am I doing?
 The door opened and Chevelle’s hands dropped as he stood to face the newcomer.
 “They are here.” It was Steed’s voice, but I didn’t raise my head, the blood still hot in my cheeks.
 “Take her to the ridge, I will meet you after…” Chevelle stopped midsentence.

She kept all the things I wasn’t allowed to touch in that room; it was supposed to be off limits.
 Not that I’d bothered trying much, because there was a large flat stone—covering where it hid in the floor—that I’d never been able to move.
 But that was before.
 I wasn’t sure how the magic had worked with the bird, but I knew it had, so I dropped to my knees, held my hands above the stone, and closed my eyes, concentrating with everything I had.
 Nothing happened right away, and my mind wandered a bit with thoughts of what might be inside, how I wanted to see and needed to touch my family heirlooms.
 The things that belonged to my mother.
 The stone lid scraped across the floor as it shifted.
 It didn’t go far, but I hadn’t needed much.
 I reached down and drew out a small leather pouch, its bronzed decorations weathered and worn.
 I laid it aside, reaching back in.

“See the torches?” Harruq asked, pointing.
 His brother nodded.
 “Velixar’s nightmares have pulled them from their slumber.
 It would be too easy otherwise.”
 “It’s going to be easy anyway,” Harruq said, drawing his blades.
 The soft red glow splashed across their faces.
 “Are you ready, brother?”
 “I am,” he lied.
 “Let’s go.”

 I wish I would have watched that show more often, then I would know what to do now.
 God why couldn’t I have been more forward thinking?
 Why did I have to waste all that time watching car racing when I could have been preparing?
 Why was I so blind?
 (Gets up and stumbles off stage)
 Cindy is waiting for the bus.
 Still dressed in summery type clothing.
 Still smiling and enjoying the weather.
 Greg walks up to her, looking unkempt and hunted.

I sifted through the dream—the memory—searching for a way to explain so she would be stunned and infuriated.
 They stared at me, and I was suddenly sure they were the reason I was lying on the ground incapacitated.
 They had control over me.
 My thoughts shifted, running through it again, going backwards from where I was.
 Their faces, the chanting from behind me, Chevelle backing away, the dream.
 The water.
 I remembered being trapped underwater just before waking, but I hadn’t been drowning.
 It wasn’t a dream.
 I was horrified as more of the memory returned.
 The cloaks who had surrounded my mother, killed her, had been circling me.

She kissed Marie's forehead and left.
 Marie curled up next to Rick's t-shirt still clutching his handkerchief.
 She felt so empty.
 She didn't sleep well that night but woke up early nevertheless.
 After bathing, she put on her emerald underwear and a simple white dress and went out into the garden.
 It didn't look so different from Rick's, she decided.
 They didn't have any white roses like he did, nor an electric fountain, but they had red roses and azaleas, just as he did.
 She wished she'd brought back a picture of him.
 But a picture wouldn't help much, she knew.
 She wanted to be in his arms, kiss him, touch him.

Surely you have seen them.
 Slip past their defenses and wait.
 When the battle comes, slaughter the elves from behind.
 You must weaken them enough so that Vaelor’s army has a chance at victory.”
 “We will not fail,” Qurrah promised.
 “Where will we meet you?”
 “Listen for where the screams are at their worst,” Velixar said as his shadow began to fade.
 “There shall I be.”
 A pale hand reached inside his robes and pulled out five glass vials.
 Qurrah knelt and accepted the gifts.

He drew out his sword, grimacing at the sick wet sound it made.
 “What do we do about all the blood?” he asked.
 “We will clean it, but first we must drain the body.”
 The two dug through dressers upstairs, grabbing old and expensive robes and shirts.
 They then dragged the body outside to where the deceased elf had kept a private garden.
 Thick brick walls guarded against any prying eyes.
 They dug a large hole in a corner and then bled the body dry, letting the fluids soak into the dirt.
 Occasionally, they would halt and listen, worried their violent struggle had reached unwanted ears.
 No curious investigators arrived, however, and they continued with their dark deed.
 When the blood dripping from the elf’s wounds became but a trickle, they filled the hole and moved on.

Leave now and I won't follow you."
 The anger was still there, but now there were other emotions, one of which I could identify, one of which I knew how to handle.
 "It was you the whole time, wasn't it?
 The bank.
 The mayor.
 Were you responsible for the Les Misérables tickets too?"
 "Why?
 What possible difference does it make one way or the other?"
 The words had lost most of their force, but none of the feeling behind them.
 "Because I want to understand.

You finished eighth overall in the tournament, with a second place white ribbon for the joust.
 Several of those who would now be higher are too injured to continue.
 So you are now in fourth place overall.
 Geriodon and Nordien were the top two finishers,” said Doi’van.
 Rodregas nodded.
 The pain was easier to manage knowing that at least he was still in the running for the tournament championship.
 Imeralda stepped into his sight shaking her head, “You men are crazy sometimes; you actually look pleased!
 If your armor had not held you would be dead now.
 And it is not like you are fighting someone who deserves to die.
 Most of these men are honorable warriors.” Rodregas nodded.

"Mmm."
 Her hand slid to the nape of his neck, gently pulling his head closer.
 He kissed her again, enjoying the sweet warmth of her lips, the eagerness of her response.
 He felt her slender fingers stroking his neck, and remembering how she'd run her hands over his chest yesterday evening, he wished he'd taken off his shirt.
 Marie sighed into Rick's mouth.

Now it was sounding like it'd been too good to be true.
 The move had been something I'd opposed and then ignored when my opposition hadn't made any difference.
 I didn't know anything about grown-up things like mortgages.
 I'd been too self-absorbed to learn.
 For the first time I felt guilty about making things harder for Mom.
 Surely there was something I could have done to help out, even considering the attacks.
 "They can't do that, can they?
 I mean, if they told you that you had the job they can't take it away, can they?"
 Mom rooted around in a half empty box until she found some tissues, it wasn't the first one she'd been through this afternoon.
 "I didn't think so, but Mr. Peters claims there was never any contract signed and I can't find our copy in any of the boxes."

I could just make out Isaac's towering form across the pavilion in the corner where they'd apparently gone to find room for some of their more impressive moves.
 It seemed amazing to me that they were willing to move so quickly around normal, uninformed humans, but apparently they figured professional dancers were at least as quick.
 I shook my head and turned back to Rachel, only to feel my throat constrict as I saw Britney.
 Not only was she wearing a tight, black dress that made her look at least twice as hot as me, she also happened to be draped across Brandon's arm.
 I was so caught up watching Britney that it took me several seconds to notice the differences in her date.
 Brandon had always exuded a sense of confidence, but sometime since I'd last seen him, it had morphed into something even more aggressive.
 He still cut through crowds, but people weren't moving out of his way out of deference anymore.
 Instead they were dodging away to avoid being run over.
 I felt the fine hair on the back of my neck stand on end, but was distracted by Alec's return before I could figure out what else had changed about Brandon.
 Jasmin pulled Rachel to her feet, and gently pushed her towards Alec before casually taking a seat next to me.

Pete and I sat in the back of this police car on our bound hands in silence.
 They eventually pulled us out of the car and beat the shit out of us.
 They undid our handcuffs when they were done, emptied our pockets of every dollar, and even took the pot we had.
 They left us in the field and all we knew to do was to walk back the way we came.
 We hitchhiked to the airport and stood outside where the planes were de-boarding.
 We hustled an unsuspecting tourist into buying our surfboards so we could return to California.
 I collect-called my mother from Waikiki once we knew what flight we would be on and she was surprised to hear my voice since we hadn’t talked in months.
 She picked us up at the airport and I think her head almost turned in a circle when she saw us.
 Our hair was down to the middle of our backs and we were as dark as natives.
 It was crazy times then.

“All things are for a reason.
 Even those who dwell in the darkness such as I will not deny this truth.
 You were meant for me.
 I will train you, and you will aid me in sundering all that brings false stability to this chaotic world.”
 “For death and power,” Qurrah whispered.
 “For Karak,” Velixar corrected.
 “When can I meet your brother?”
 The half-orc shrugged.
 While he seemed calm, the man in black did not miss how his eyes still refused to meet his.
 “Give me time,” Qurrah said.

Reducing the quantity and des tructive power of weapons arsenals will certainly reduce the actual and perceived risks of conflict.
 But, at the same time, a tendency is emerging to perpetuate the ‘we–they’ syndrome of competitive security by shifting the axis from East–West to North–South.
 This has resulted in increasing pressure on developing countries by multilateral and bilateral aid agencies seeking to bring down military expenditure among aid-dependent countries even further.
 In doing so, it ignores the right and responsibility of these nations to provide for their own legitimate security needs at a time when no alternative mechanism exists at the international level to ensure the inviolability of their borders.
 There is truth in the claim that military spending by developing countries has increased dramatically during the past 30 years.
 This increase is partially explained by the fact that more than 100 new sovereign nations have emerged, many of which were protected, prior to independence, by the colonial powers that have now withdrawn.
 The acquisition of even modest defensive capabilities may consume a significant portion of national income when the economic base is small, as it is for many of these nations.
 In addition, the increasing incidence of war, terrorism and drug-related violence in the developing world has heightened the sense of insecurity among these countries.
 However, a closer analysis reveals that half of the military expenditure of the developing world is incurred by a small number of oil-exporting countries in the Middle East and North Africa, and another quarter is incurred by other high-income developing nations, mostly in East and South East Asia – whereas the 84 developing nations with lower and lower-middle incomes, including such large nations as China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Bangladesh, comprising 72 per cent of the world’s population, incur roughly 6 per cent of global military expenditure, on average less than 3 per cent of the total GDP of these countries.
 International pressure for defining acceptable levels of military expenditure and reducing defence budgets is entirely warranted, provided that it is applied equitably to all countries, takes into account the varying conditions between regions and nations, and places corresponding limitations on arms exports by industrialized nations.

 “Well,” Seth stated, “maybe we should ask the dwarfs where he is.” “That’ll be hard.” Emily pointed out.
 “They hardly tell us anything as it is.
 You try squeezing out information from one of these pests.” “I did.” “Whatever guys, we’re getting nowhere.
 Hey Emily you want to sleep over tonight?” I asked.
 Emily frowned, “It’s my turn, Jazell, and you’re coming over my house.” “Honestly, Em, just come over…” “No,” she said and crossed her arms stubbornly.
 I sighed and ran a hand through my hair, knowing it was useless to argue with her when her mind was made up.
 “Fine, I’ll call my parents.
 But next time you’re coming to my house.” She nodded, her curls bobbing.
 “Fair enough.” “Okay then, see you two later.” Jason turned around with Seth on his heels.

At the same time, the democratic tendency is strengthened substantially by rising standards of living.
 As democracies distribute political power, they also tend to distribute the benefits of science, technology, information and education, which are the essential building blocks of economic development.
 Democracies provide greater access to resources, permit greater social mobility, and encourage institutional innovation.
 Not surprisingly, today all of the high-income industrial nations, as well as the top 25 ranked nations on UNDP’s Human Development Index, are liberal democracies.
 In contrast, only eight of the 43 poorest nations have multi-party democratic political systems.
 Even among the poorest countries, democracy has served to protect the population from the worst scourges of war and poverty that have ravaged many authoritarian countries.
 Economist Amartya Sen was one of the earliest to observe that no country with a democratic government and a free press has suffered from famine during the last four decades.
 India, the world’s most populous democracy, suffered its last major famine prior to independence in 1943.
 Although a major famine threatened ten million lives in India during the mid-1960s, it was averted by the government’s emergency measures and timely launching of the Green Revolution.
 In contrast, as many as 30 million persons may have died of famine in China during the late 1950s.

Davis always had to work during his lunch hour.
 Go to a picture?
 Davis thought they were a waste of time.
 Marie climbed into bed with a frown.
 She and Davis were going to have to have a serious discussion.
 She didn't intend to have a husband whom she saw only at meals and at bedtime.
 CHAPTER SIX
 Marie awoke at dawn the next morning and jumped into her clothes.
 She was halfway down the stairs when she remembered she'd promised Rick that she'd wake him up so that he could stay within earshot of her.
 "Rick," she called, tapping on his door.

 I imagined I could hear him smile.
 "Thank you.
 I'm afraid mostly all I see is the flaws.
 Even with the most perfect subjects, I still generally fail to capture their true essence."
 "But not all?"
 "No, not all of them."
 It was getting harder and harder to string thoughts together in a comprehensible manner.

They fought with their heads, and such foolishness could not be tolerated.
 “Fine, I’ll show you a real warrior,” he said.
 His muscles tensed, his legs bulged, and then he charged the two, oblivious to his own safety.
 Overwhelming any of their attacks, he was a moving mountain of muscle, dangerous and powerful.
 The meager defenses of the guards faltered.
 One tried to block as Condemnation came for his head.
 The blade broke through and cleaved his skull in two.
 The other brought his sword down too late.
 Salvation tore through his chainmail.
 Harruq whirled on him, a quick double strike knocking the sword from his hand.

I'm not going to move.
 She doesn't mean anything to you.
 What about me?"
 Jasmin stopped moving.
 She was still shaking, and when she looked up at me, her eyes still bubbled with hate, but they were human again instead of the pale, ice blue from a moment before.
 With a visible effort of will, Jasmin closed her eyes, calmed her shaking body, and then turned and quickly walked out of the room.
 I was just tall enough to see over Rachel and take in what was going on in the rest of the room.
 James' eyes were still yellow, and he was still inching his way towards me, obviously undeterred by Jasmin's defection.
 The Hispanic girl carefully closed the distance between them, and then placed her slender, perfect dark hand on James' arm once again as she leaned in and whispered something in his ear.
 For a moment it seemed he was going to shake her off again but then he shuddered, shot Alec another dirty look, and stormed out of the room.

There was probably money in the purser’s office, but he knew that the door, as well as the room was rigged with poison needles and other traps, both mundane and magical.
 Rodregas had the impression that Ravenhurr had spent most of his wealth of late on the Dire Cats.
 After Rodregas’ recent generosity, he did not want to take the risk of dying for a nearly empty treasure box.
 He looked out of the entrance, over to the gate and up to the top of the wall where a small tower provided cover.
 There, one of the few guards left should be watching the front gate.
 Also kept in the tower were two of the nicest weapons Rodregas had ever seen: a pair of recurve bows of Wood Nymph created black yew.
 There was no way they would have been taken.
 There were standing orders to kill anyone who tried to remove them.
 Rodregas was not a very good bowman, but he was definitely going to try to bring them with him.
 He peeked out of the main doors and looked around the open keep.

"The plane goes really fast down the runway until the air lifts it."
 "It's so big and has all these people in it.
 How does it stay in the air without falling?"
 "I don't know much about aerodynamics."
 "About what?"
 "What keeps the plane in the air."
 Marie couldn't wait to feel the airplane move.
 It was hard to believe that it could stay up in the air.
 She'd seen airplanes before, but she'd never been in one.
 She didn't even know anyone who had.

There was no point in pretending that she was in 1927.
 The clothes couldn't change what had happened.
 Even getting home tomorrow wouldn't change what had happened, what she’d finally realized tonight.
 She went downstairs and turned on the TV, wondering where Rick was.
 She felt bad for running away from him.
 She knew she must have hurt him, and the last thing in the world she wanted was to hurt Rick.
 He was the sweetest, kindest, most wonderful man in the world, and he couldn't help it if his kisses confused her, made her .

Can he ki...beat Brandon?"
 Isaac's sigh was eloquent.
 "I'm forbidden to speak on these things.
 To do so risks no small amount of Alec's displeasure."
 "But you're going to anyways, aren't you?"
 "It is right that you know the sacrifice undertaken on your behalf, both by Alec, and by the rest of our family.
 The one because of his feelings for you, the other because of our respect and love for Alec."
 "It's true then; he can't win."
 "While it isn't impossible, it's unlikely.
 Alec is a remarkable fighter, to hear Donovan speak of it, he's possibly even almost the equal of his father, but Brandon's strength and speed have not seen a match in centuries.

“Get back you smelly thing,” the other guard said.
 Both stood to face him as other guards stirred from their blankets and bedrolls.
 They still wore their chainmail, proof something had disturbed them greatly.
 Sleeping in armor was far from comfortable.
 “Me only a little smelly,” Harruq slurred.
 “Do you have any food, me be starving, and me brother no be feelin’ too good.
 Just look at him!”
 Qurrah chuckled at the act while his concealed whip writhed about his arm.
 “What is going on?” asked a whiny little voice.
 From the lone tent, a skinny man in purple and red emerged stinking of perfume.

I heard Emily yell the first curse words I’ve heard her say in a while.
 I spotted her red arm just before my body felt like fire.
 I closed my eyes and blacked out.
 I didn’t really black out but that’s what I thought at the time.
 I opened my eyes to find I was sitting on the ground next to my sleeping body.
 I saw Emily sitting there, saying nothing for once.
 Something fell off my back and I picked it up.
 It was a wooden bow, and when I reached behind my back I felt a quiver full of feathered arrows strapped there.
 I ran a finger over the smooth, dark wood and turned to see Seth crashing out of the woods.
 I smirked at him and pointed at his head.

It was scary.
 Right then, right at that very moment, I knew something was terribly wrong.
 They all stopped in front of us, all those pairs of angry eyes staring at us.
 They made me confused, from the warm feeling the Frost Beasts gave me to the cold feeling the Thrashers inflicted.
 They exchanged some sort of signal, including grunts and yips, and slowly advanced on us.
 The dogs stalked toward the four of us looking like a animals about to attack their prey.
 The cute look was gone and all that was left was hunger.
 The dog nearest to me jumped at my chest and landed on my stomach.
 I managed to push it down before it breathed on me.
 My legs froze in place.

“Well, he caught my brother practicing a spell once.
 Qurrah was forbidden from ever casting magic, yet he tried anyway.
 He’s like that, always been, always will.
 Anyway, his master took a hot poker and shoved it down his throat.
 Said that way he’d never cast again.”
 Harruq chuckled.
 “He was wrong, obviously.
 Qurrah was stuck talking like that.
 Like a snake hiss or a raspy whisper.”
 “Or a dying man,” Aurelia whispered, so soft that Harruq could not make out her words.

The euphoria of those heady days generated high expectations of a peace dividend that would help to wipe away much of the world’s suffering.
 At the same time, the withdrawal of the confrontation between East and West resulted in a gradual shift of attention from the threat of imminent global self-destruction to lesser but very real problems, among them – the unresolved danger arising from huge stockpiles of nuclear weapons; some 26 on-going localized military conflicts within and between developing nations, aggravated by increased trafficking in small armaments; the persistence of hunger and malnutrition, especially among the poorest populations of South Asia and politically unstable regions of Africa; progressively rising levels of unemployment in both industrialized and developing countries; and the turbulence and hardship of political, economic and social transition in post-Communist Eastern Europe.
 These challenges, coupled with the outbreak of the first Gulf War, the disintegration of Yugoslavia, and the horrendous civil wars that wracked Somalia and Rwanda, clouded the world’s vision of a brighter future.
 It was in this context that the Commission undertook five years of research that led to the publication of its report in the fall of 1994.
 The report was released at official functions at UN headquarters in New York, UNESCO in Paris, a global congress of the World Academy of Art and Science at Minneapolis, and in the restored capital of a reunited Germany at Berlin, then formally presented to the UN Secretary General and to all UN member nations by a member of the Commission, Her Majesty Queen Noor on behalf of the Government of Jordan.
 In the decade since then, much has happened to belie the expectations of post-Cold War optimists and pessimists alike.
 On the positive side, the sudden emergence and explosive growth of the Internet and the World Wide Web have fuelled a global revolution in communication, education, economy and a wide range of human activities reaching from corporate board rooms in North America to rural towns and villages on every continent, abridging the time, distance and differences separating countries, classes and people.
 The end of Apartheid in South Africa completed a century-long struggle, ridding the world of a horrible scourge.
 Democratic systems of governance characterized by the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free media replaced dictatorships around the world.
 The establishment of the World Trade Organization paved the way for expanded markets for both developing and developed countries, fuelled a rapid expansion in World Trade, and wove strong bonds of interdependence between erstwhile antagonists across the globe from the Chinese mainland to North America.

Despite Britney's best efforts to distract me with a point-by-point analysis of what was going on with someone named Sandra, and the two boys she'd been leading on for the last month.
 I followed Britney through the lunch line, gripping my meal replacement drink with both hands.
 We sat down at our usual table, only to be surrounded a few seconds later by an energetic mob of familiar-looking people.
 It wasn't until Brandon slid into the seat next to me that I realized who everyone was.
 "We thought maybe we'd come join the two of you today.
 That shabby little corner where we always sit was getting a little old."
 Brandon's voice was smooth and flawless as always, but even that couldn't distract me enough to miss the flash of dislike in Cassie's eyes as she sat down next to Britney.
 Nobody talked about anything important, which was good since I couldn't focus on anything other than the fact I'd just been given one more sign, a really big one, that Brandon was interested in me.
 A couple of minutes before the warning bell rang, I looked up from the group and saw another familiar face leaving the lunchroom.
 Everything suddenly dropped into place, and I grabbed Brandon's arm.

"I'm exhausted," she told him, dropping onto the bed.
 "So am I."
 He took her wrist.
 "Lie down here with me and watch this `Mad About You' rerun."
 His arms went around her when she settled down beside him.
 She sighed and was instantly asleep.
 The last thing Rick remembered was Murray, the dog, drinking out of a toilet.
 When he opened his eyes again, the news was on.
 He yawned, wanting to stretch but finding that Marie lay on one arm.
 He looked down at her, smiling.

The information should be shared with the UN Environmental Programme and the Sustain able Development Council.
 In each case it will be necessary to show how action implemented by the military will be more cost-effective than using traditional resources.
 3.A UN International Force for Development should be constituted under a democratized UN structure, consisting of demobilized military personnel and young professionals from different countries, which will be trained and equipped to promote people-centred, environmentally sound development initiatives that integrate political, social, economic and cultural factors.
 4.Global security is threatened by mass population movements, potential changes in sea levels, drought and famine.
 Greater international cooperation is needed in the sharing of national military manpower, under the auspices of a new UN Earth corps.
 Article 43 of the UN Charter, which was originally drawn up for dealing with the threat of conventional war, can be interpreted to apply to threats to environmental security as well.
 In parallel to a UN Earth corps, national Earth corps units should be constituted to operate within each state and for service internationally under the UN.
 Vocational skills imparted through these agencies will be of subsequent use to the community at large.
 5.A greater degree of cooperation in the sharing of environmental data is essential if global security is to be enhanced, particularly that gained from military remote-sensing devices.
 This is especially relevant to the majority of nations which do not have such equipment at their disposal.

“Found him,” she whispered.
 !
 [section break](break.png)
 A blue portal ripped through the air before Qurrah, beckoning him.
 He looked through but saw only mists and distorted landscape.
 Seeing nothing to lose, he got to his feet and stepped inside.
 He felt the sensation of traveling a great distance yet his mind insisted he had taken only a single step.
 He could see the orange glow of the great pyre several miles away.
 “Brother!” Harruq cried, wrapping him in a hug.
 Qurrah endured it, keeping his hands at his sides.

But Marie clung to him, rubbing her face against his neck.
 "Kiss me again, please," she murmured, raising her head to press her lips to his.
 He couldn't resist her, and his mouth began moving over hers again.
 But at last he forced himself to break away.
 "Marie, we have to stop," he told her, literally holding her at arm's length.
 "Why?"
 she panted.
 "Why don't you want to kiss me any more?"
 "I want to--I just can't.
 Let me cool off a minute."

“Achoo!” “Choo!” “Hachoo!” My ears popped as I burst out with laughter.
 Evelyn began to run toward town and I couldn’t stifle it, despite the fact that it was absurd something as insignificant as a sneeze would give me such pleasure.
 I wondered briefly how I’d delight in a choking fit and then tugged the lobe of my ear as it popped again.
 Apparently I wasn’t used to laughing.
 I strode off toward home, taking the long route despite my good humor.
 As I approached the old tree, its twisted and gnarled limbs reaching into a cloudless gray sky, I caught sight of an aged elf leaving.
 My stomach dropped; it was a Council member.
 Tassels hung around his neck depicting lines and accomplishments: sky blue for receiving the calling, deep crimson for service to the guard.
 His chest bore a personalized crest, an oak leaf on an unbroken shield of gold and acorn brown.
 I watched from the trees as a rainbow of a half dozen tassels fluttered behind him where he rushed down the path toward the village.

Marie caught her breath, clutching at Rick's shoulders.
 Her fingers dug into them as his tongue traced a path up her throat to her chin and then to her mouth, teasing her lips until she gripped the back of his head to pull it to hers, needing his mouth hard on hers.
 Rick's kiss was passionate, possessive.
 Alternately he savored the taste and feel of her and then devoured her, feeling her passion and hunger grow.
 Almost without thinking, he slipped his hand inside her blouse just to touch the soft skin of her midriff, but he withdrew it when he heard her gasp.
 “I’m sorry,” he whispered.
 “No .
 .
 .
 no,” she breathed.

 He isn't what you think, you really shouldn't trust him."
 Now she'd gone too far.
 "Brandon didn't put me up to anything.
 Unlike you, I can actually think for myself.
 I don't know what kind of sick hold Alec has over you, but until you do something about it, you'll never have any real friends.
 He won't ever let you have one."
 She wiped away a pair of tears before they could escape from the corner of her eyes.
 "You don't know what you're talking about, Adri.
 You really can't trust Brandon.

When I finally surfaced from abeja, camisa, and reloj it was just five minutes before I was supposed to close up for the afternoon.
 Rachel pulled her things together and left while I was straightening up the chairs.
 It was petty, but I waited inside the room until the clock showed exactly the time the lab was supposed to finish, and then joined Britney outside in the oppressive heat.
 The air was so dry I could nearly feel it pulling the moisture out of my body as we started around the school towards where Britney had parked her car.
 As we reached the west side of the building, the high-pitched growl of a performance engine tore a hole in the relative silence.
 The edge of the student parking lot was just barely in view now, but it was enough to see the source of the noise.
 A tiny figure barely recognizable as Rachel, was walking towards a dark-blue bullet bike, which had just roared to life.
 We had to walk several more steps before I recognized the leather-clad, dark-haired figure on the bike as Alec.
 My feet must have unconsciously slowed because Britney was now several steps ahead of me and looking back impatiently.
 I tried to catch up, but Alec chose that moment to look up and stare in our direction.

So when I arrived in my jeans and flannel shirt at a party to which they hadn’t invited girls yet they still dressed in alligator shoes and polished chino slacks, at least a few of them took offense.
 The Polish fellow began goading me, first about my clothes, then about the beard I had grown, then about what losers were all us from California.
 I attempted patience, since I was their guest and because I remembered Tony’s stories that placed him in the low range of this crowd’s toughness.
 But at last I mouthed a comeback.
 The Polish fellow threw a punch that landed square on my jaw.
 I staggered.
 He tackled me.
 I fell and my head whacked the concrete floor.
 The next I knew, several guys were pounding various parts of me.
 I couldn’t seem to move from the waist up.

We hadn't gone more than a step or two before his grip on my arm grew painful.
 I hissed in discomfort and he released me, but not before I noticed that his other hand was white-knuckled and his jaw was clenched.
 "Sorry, I just don't like to see that kind of needless destruction.
 It makes everyone look bad and costs the town a lot of money."
 Brandon's smile was back, but it didn't have his trademark easy carelessness.
 "Now you sound like my mom."
 We rounded a corner before Brandon could say anything else and nearly ran into Britney.
 "Guys!
 Did you see the back door?"
 I could almost see the wheels turning in Britney's head.

As she walked out with him, she waved goodbye to me.
 Earlier that day, I had noticed a Kitchen Help Wanted sign in a coffee shop.
 Since I hoped to become an instant father, in order to show the waitress my responsible side, I inquired about the job.
 The manager said, “Not your kind of work.” “Why not?” I asked, and explained that I had enjoyed last summer washing pots in a similar establishment.
 “The kitchen’s all colored help,” he said.
 “Fine with me,” I countered.
 He sighed.
 “See, we only pay Negros a quarter an hour.” Minimum wage was $1.25.
 We had noticed other outrages.
 The man, woman and colored rest rooms.

“We may have to leave,” a voice growled into her ear, “but I’m not leaving without something to remember.”
 Aurelia felt her stomach churn.
 Her assailant turned her around and flung her back against the wall.
 She glared at a pock-marked soldier bearing the crest of Neldar.
 “You’re a pretty one,” he said, his smile missing several teeth.
 He yanked at his belt while his other arm pressed against her chest and neck.
 “And you’re an idiot,” she spat.
 Much of her magic was gone, but not all.
 Her hand brushed his, and a small shock of electricity crossed between them.
 The soldier instinctively pulled his hand back, giving Aurelia the opening she needed.

A thunderous crack and excruciating light flew from both of his outstretched hands, slammed into a tall pine, and snapped the top third of the tree off.
 Several limbs splintered and popped as it crashed its way down.
 I stared in open-mouthed astonishment.
 Sweat glistened on the large man’s forehead and his breath was a little labored, but still, he stood.
 Understanding came slowly.
 He had shot lightning from his hands.
 The others nodded appreciatively, but I was having second thoughts about friendship with this man.
 Though not being his friend was probably more dangerous.
 I was shaking my head in disbelief as he turned back to me and bowed.
 He stepped back, taking a seat as the wiry man stepped inside the circle then.

CM:  	Tell us what you know about them.
 BG:  	(sighs)  Ok.  Let’s see.
 From the taping session there’s a version of “I’m Not Your Stepping Stone,” which we used to use to warm up.
 It’s raw—actually not bad for all its rawness.
 Sometimes overcooking leads to worse performances.
 There’s a live version of “A Marriage of Rue,” which is just horrendous.
 I’m not sure which concert it comes from but I’m guessing an early one.
 It doesn’t sound like we’re even playing the same song.

He was very impressed by the quality of the archery on display.
 Clearly everyone knew what they were about.
 He ended up being behind a tall young man.
 Rodregas almost thought he might have some AElf blood.
 It also looked like he might have a broken nose from the previous day’s competition.
 The young man did very well, hitting all five targets.
 His shot on the moving target only nicked the edge, still impressive.
 Rodregas stepped forward and picked up the bow.
 It felt light and a little awkward.
 Rodregas focused on his breathing.

You are a very powerful magician now.
 You could probably take one or even two of the greater sigils and still have more power than you had before, and as a warrior the enhancement from the sigil would make you an even more powerful fighter.” Rodregas nodded, “I have thought about it.
 In fact, I am sure given the opportunity that I would take on one of the greater or several of the lesser sigils.
 I am a warrior first, not a mage.
 Of course, leaving a little magic left over would be great if I can, but you never really know until after the searing.” Rodregas paused and then added, “The problem is that only two groups in the Eastern Realms have the knowledge to do the searing.
 The first, of course, is the Guild of the Celestial Path.
 I think we all agree they are not sharing it with me soon,” Rodregas continued with a smile.
 “And the second is the Knightly Order of the Soaring Heavens, who are reported to have the greatest collection, and they only let their knights be seared.
 I don’t think they are going to be sharing anytime soon either.” Imeralda looked at Rodregas.
 She knew that the Order of the Soaring Heavens was the order that Rodregas had belonged to as a squire, but his taking on of another’s body was anathema to the teaching of the order.

I can’t tell you how much I owe that girl.” Toni teaches nursing at Cuesta College.
 She knows most everything about nutrition and raising kids.
 Before Cliff and I go out to slug golf balls into the trees, Toni and I talk in the kitchen.
 After a wandering conversation about food, kids and baseball somehow leads to spiritual matters, Toni mentions that she has always supposed people turn to God for comfort.
 What I don’t know about people in general could probably fill all the world’s libraries.
 But I can offer that I have turned to God at various times for a variety of reasons.
 In hopes of gaining understanding.
 To lessen my likelihood of hurting people.
 Out of fear.
 On account of worries about my kids.

The tournament draws the powerful and those who wish to be powerful.
 I would simply suggest that you keep your eyes open, and keep your  mind a little more focused both on your journey and at the Cathedral,” Van’dret’s tone almost dismissed his own comment as a simple chatter of no import.
 Accept Van’dret had been invited to have lunch with one of the most powerful people on the planet to drop the simply suggestion that he should keep his eyes open for something unusual at the Cathedral of the Heavens.
 The rest of the dinner quickly wrapped up, and Van’dret soon found himself caught up in thought as he journeyed down several floors to the Great Hall that served as the gathering place for the other Immortalist in residence in the city.
 His questing mind was rudely interrupted by a woman stepping to his side and asking him, “so did you ask him?” “Ask him what?” Van’dret asked.
 The Immortalist Sorcerer in the form of a tall athletic human female with spectacular long red hair and blue eyes gave Van’dret a silent glare before responding.
 “Last night at the arena party you agreed to ask Van’dret where Oreintvenir is,” She replied in a clear clipped voice.
 “Actually,” Van’dret responded, “I think I said that my visit to his solar would be a perfect opportunity to ask him if he knew the location of our missing Grand Master.” “So why did you not take advantage of the opportunity?
 If anyone knows where Oreintvenir is; it is Taiga” “My lovely Gracella, you are an Immortalist of impressive power and intellect.
 But we are Immortalist, time is on our side and Grand Master Oreintvenir has been gone for less than a year.

Jim – Hate to break it to you, but Eugene doesn’t inspire fear into anyone.
 Well maybe girls who might one day marry a guy with the name Eugene.
 In fact I bet mom’s all over the country use that as a threat ‘eat yer peas or else maybe you’ll end up marrying a guy named Eugene.’  I bet it works too.
 I’d be afraid.
 Eugene - Shut up dude.
 Jim – So, what’d you do to get your butt almost handed to you this time?
 Eugene – Nothing.
 Jim – Even wannabes don’t usually beat people up for no reason.
 What’d you do this time?

We only had a moment before I was torn away from her, yet I feel I got the message through.
 ~ She came to see me last night.
 I don’t know how she got past the guards.
 But I begged her to keep our secret, for her protection…
 And then several pages were torn from the diary before it continued.
 It was an accident.
 A product of her temper, her human emotions.
 They were testing her, a servant told me.
 Anvil was holding her back, Rune with magic.
 She snapped and they saw her power.

At each stage of this evolution, society discovered the power of knowledge to increase further the productivity of the material, technological and organizational resources at its disposal.
 A knowledge of weather patterns boosted productivity in agriculture.
 A knowledge of astronomy enabled sea-worthy vessels to travel across the oceans to distant lands.
 This led to the invention of systematic education as a method to pass on acquired knowledge and skills to the next generation and thereby continuously increase them.
 The Ultimate Resource
 These rich and varied discoveries came as the result of a careful observation and analysis of the external world around us, an infinite exploration and experimentation with things, an endless trial and error blending of minerals and plants to forge metals and produce medicines.
 As a result, for millennia we have tended to overlook or, at best, grossly underestimate the greatest of all resources and the true source of all the discoveries, inventions, creativity and productive power found in nature – the resource that has made minerals into ships that sail the skies, fashioned grains of sand into tiny electronic brains, released the energy of the sun from the atom, modified the genetic code of plants to increase their vigour and productivity – the ultimate resource, the human being.
 World Food Prize recipient and father of India’s milk revolution, Dr V. Kurien, has decried the tendency to credit external factors for the accomplishment of people.
 ‘It is the farmer that has produced this miracle, not the cow.’ And so it can be said of the Industrial Revolution and the Green Revolution.
 Looked at from a different perspective, the entire evolution of civilization is a progressive act of humanity’s self-discovery.

"How about me knowing Britney left you high and dry after school today?"
 "Please.
 That just makes the humiliation more painful."
 Brandon shook his head as we pulled to a stop in front of my house.
 "No, that means I can do something about you losing your ride."
 I suddenly felt like there was a joke I was missing out on.
 "How do you propose to fix that?"
 "It was my fault so I'll be your ride back and forth from school every day."
 "I don't know about all of that, but thanks for the lift just now."
 I fumbled for a minute with the unfamiliar latch, and then invited the blistering heat into the cool interior of the car as I swung the door open.

His touch lingered and I glanced down, surprised to see he had a firm grip on the necklace but wasn’t lifting it, couldn’t lift it.
 I looked to the council leaders as the guard turned toward the table and decisively stepped away from me.
 “The crystal will not be removed,” he said.
 Though he spoke only to the elders, it set into motion behind us a wave of murmurs that filled the room, reverberating up the high ceiling.
 A council elder silenced the witnesses and then trained on me.
 “Who instructed you in fusion?” I didn’t have an answer.
 I’d never heard of fusion.
 I wasn’t sure what to do, and I looked toward Chevelle out of desperation.
 He was watching me, surprise clear on his face.
 Whatever I’d been accused of, he hadn’t expected it.

I gasped as I realized what Alec must have suspected for quite some time.
 "You mean that was really him in my dreams?"
 "Indeed.
 That's part of why he was so concerned you might be a powerful Fir'shan posing as a normal human."
 A tiny sound just outside the door preempted my next question.
 Alec carefully maneuvered a pair of huge metal baskets in through the door.
 I felt my eyes go wide as I realized that they were full of hundreds of cans of food.
 I didn't even want to guess at how much weight was in each basket, but as Alec cleared the door it was obvious that the slow speed that he'd been moving at had only been due to him not wanting to hit anything.
 He moved like they weighed no more than a couple of pillows as he crossed the cabin and set them down in front of what must be the food pantry.
 "That was almost as quick as normal."

“Grab my wrist,” Qurrah said as the dark cloud arrived that night.
 Harruq did so, and together they stepped inside.
 He felt an unseen hand grab his chest, and then they were running blind.
 The minutes crawled, their frantic breathing the only audible sound.
 Qurrah lagged further and further behind, unable to keep the pace.
 Harruq tightened his grip on his wrist and pulled him along.
 The terrain sloped beneath them as they climbed a hill.
 Another quick shift and they were stumbling down that same hill.
 The cold hand vanished.
 The cloud dissipated.

I had a moment to realize I was still going to die all alone, and then the blackness came for me.
 Chapter 21 I woke up expecting to see pale blue eyes burning a hole through me.
 Haunting eyes set above terrible fangs.
 Instead I found myself lying atop a gigantic bed in a room I didn't recognize.
 The sheer shock at still being alive prevented my mind from working very well.
 It took several minutes before all of the other relatively inconsequential details started filtering in.
 My hands were bandaged, as was my elbow and right calf.
 My dirty, ripped jeans and shirt had been replaced with clean clothes that were only a little too small.
 That last fact should have alarmed me more than it did.
 Somehow being stripped down by a stranger paled in comparison to a near-death hallucination involving wolves and a monster straight out of a science fiction movie.

He took up the chase.
 !
 [section break](break.png)
 An elderly man and woman, propping each other up as they ran side by side, refused to turn when Harruq barreled toward them.
 Salvation took the woman’s life, Condemnation the man’s.
 The two bodies collapsed, their lifeless limbs entangled.
 Not far ahead of them, a woman ran in only her shift, a child clutched to her breast.
 “Why do you flee?” Harruq roared when her crying eyes glanced back at him.
 “This life is pain, suffering!
 I’m here to end it, end it all!”

 Do you have any pocket change to spare?"
 She received a nice allowance, but she knew she could always count on her father for a little extra.
 "Let's see."
 He took out his wallet and pulled out a ten.
 "How's this?"
 "Thank you, Father."
 She kissed the top of his head.
 "Who are you going shopping with?"
 "No one, but I'm meeting Mother for lunch.

My questing hand finally found the tiny, hard-plastic package, and I grabbed on with all of my fading strength.
 The darkness was still beckoning, but alternating images of Jasmin and Alec flashed before my eyes.
 I was so confused that I couldn't make sense of the flood of emotions that accompanied the pictures, other than the fact that terror came to the forefront as they sped up.
 Faster and faster the two figures changed places, and then they disappeared.
 It was like my mind was a computer that'd overheated and had to reboot.
 I opened my eyes and met Rachel's worried gaze.
 My pulse was still elevated, and I was breathing too hard.
 It seemed impossible for Britney and Jackie not to hear and realize something was up, but a quick look verified that they were still lost in their respective inner worlds.
 "You just had another fainting spell, didn't you?"
 I felt my eyes go wide.

He even seems to be angrier than usual.
 Jim – I’ve noticed that he’s been in a worse mood than normal, but what do you want me to do about it?
 He doesn’t like me any more than he likes the rest of the world.
 I can’t think of anything I can really do for him.
 Art – Maybe not, maybe not.
 He may hate us all for all eternity, but I’m going to try anyway.
 I can’t just let him waste away like this.
 I’ll do my best by him.
 That is about all I can offer him.
 It’s all I could ever offer him, and it was never enough, your mother saw to that.

 Even after I dropped the bowling ball on the doll.

 Jim – Maybe you didn’t do it right.
 Johnny – Hey, I followed the instructions that came with it to the letter.

I wasn’t doing anything wrong, but I didn’t want to flaunt it.
 I had no good reason for researching Chevelle Vattier, except I had been thinking about him all day.
 You just met him this morning.
 Not even met.
 Stared at.
 Heat crept into my cheeks for no good reason, and I picked up my pace to the old tree that housed the library.
 I knew my shoulders were drawn in and I was glancing around too often, but I couldn’t seem to help it.
 It felt illicit.
 Twice I imagined a set of dark eyes on me, a pricking sensation running over my spine.
 I was going to have to pull myself together.

“That’s all I own.
 They’re comfortable, they last.
 I just bought two new pairs of jeans for $16 each, and they’ll last two years.
 To me, the key to living well is living in a way that gives an opportunity for appreciating nature and friends and taking time for prayer and writing and helping people.
 And unless you inherit a pile of money, the way to live like that is to not want a lot of stuff.
 Most stuff is just clutter.
 But our culture feeds the desire to own or consume until what we think we need makes us greedy.
 “The Bible says that we should work so we’ll have something to share with people in need.
 I can work for a few days a week and by not letting myself want a bunch of stuff, I can have money to give away.
 So I’m careful about what I buy, and I pick the things I do buy for durability and longevity.

Regardless of how the fight turns out, you'll need to be well-rested."
 My best longing look didn't seem to be having any effect on him, so I finally nodded and relaxed back onto the bed.
 "I guess I did promise to behave myself.
 I don't think I'll be able to sleep, but if you'll tell me another story I'll at least try..." Apparently satisfied by my promise, Alec joined me on the bed and pulled me close.
 I was still chilled enough from being outside for the warmth of his arms to feel good.
 "Adjam and Inock found that the dayborn had lost all knowledge of their loving mother, and that they reacted poorly to Inock's plague form.
 Neither brother was able to maintain their original forms for more than a few hours at a time, and although Adjam was able to blend in with the animals found in the area, there was nothing like Inock's feline body nearby, and he was chased and hunted by many of the dayborn, for they thought him a demon."
 Alec's breath caressed the back of my neck even as his quiet, velvety baritone reached inside my head and smoothed away the tensions that'd been keeping me from seeking sleep.
 I knew there'd been a reason for being so scared, but I just couldn't bring myself to care about it now.
 "The brothers watched the dayborn for many turnings, but although they learned many things, they found themselves unable to learn the dayborns' language.

He grinned at her.
 She smiled a bit, her eyes on her knife as she spread the butter.
 "I wanted you to kiss me then."
 "I know."
 When she looked up in astonishment, he explained, "I wouldn't have kissed you if you hadn't wanted me to.
 Like I told you that night, I'll never do anything you don't like."
 "But how did you know I wanted you to kiss me?"
 "By the way you were looking at me."
 "How was I looking at you?"
 "Like you wanted me to kiss you."

The pace of human development continues to accelerate.
 The world has changed more during the present century than in the previous nineteen centuries combined – economically, socially, politically, scientifically and technologically.
 In recent decades humankind has been buffeted by a bewildering array and intensity of transforming powers – democratization, decolonization, demilitarization, globalization, universal education, scientific advances, information, successive technological revolutions brought about by the automobile, telephone, radio, television, jet aircraft, computers, satellite communications and genetic engineering.
 Coping with such rapid change has not been easy.
 It has brought in its wake a broad array of problems – a widening gap between the most advanced and least developed sections both within and between nations, a disequilibrium between growth of population and economic growth, rising unemployment, alienated youth, increasing violence and crime, depletion of natural resources, degradation of the environment, overcrowded cities, mass migrations of talent from South to North, displacement of millions of political and economic refugees, the breakdown of the family and the erosion of traditional social institutions.
 Although much has been learned about the various stages of social and economic development, much less is known about the actual process itself by which societies transit from one stage or level or form to another.
 As a result, our efforts to speed the transition are often haphazard, stumbling and fraught with difficulty.
 Today former colonial nations such as Vietnam and Zimbabwe strive to catch up with countries that have never been subject to foreign rule.
 The tribal nations of central Africa struggle at great cost to transform themselves into modern states.
 Even within the prosperous West, the speed and extent of progress is uneven, leading to the emergence of ‘developing countries’ within developed nations, of poverty-stricken families in inner cities with rates of chronic unemployment as high as 50 per cent or more.

Rick kissed her cheek, his heart aching for both of them.
 "I understand, sweetheart.
 But I want you to know that I love you and that if you ever change your mind, I'll make you my wife and make you so happy you'll never regret your decision."
 He kissed her then, but she found the pleasure too painful to bear and ended the kiss, pressing her face into his shoulder as she cried.
 His declaration that he wanted to marry her had torn her apart.
 She loved him so much.
 But she didn't belong here!
 She had a home, a mother and father and brother and friends .

“Will that be a problem?” Alvrik asked.
 “Up to all the others you hire,” Harruq said.
 “But I’ll be fine.
 I don’t start much, but I always finish.”
 Alvrik laughed.
 He nudged the man next to him, who grabbed the quill.
 “Give me your name,” he asked, dabbing the tip into the ink.
 “Harruq,” he said.
 “Harruq Tun.”
 “Well, Harruq,” Alvrik said, slowly nodding his head.

There was an abundance of streams running through the hills, and a few patches of fat, amethyst berries along the way, so I couldn’t complain.
 And the route was undemanding; the ground was smooth, nothing too overgrown to make passage difficult, none of those nasty snarls that could form from a maze of thorn trees or the network of vines that could tangle your legs.
 The grass was tall, but soft, so it rolled over, hiding no more than the occasional field mouse or vole.
 Sporadic wildflowers dotted the hills, small sprays of pinks or spiky yellowbird.
 The sky was cloudless and blue, the sun a constant companion as I carried on through the days and hills.
 Each new day was something unexpected, and the trip became less daunting than it might have otherwise been.
 I was moving every moment of light, and so exhaustion pulled me into sleep every moment of darkness.
 I concentrated on each step, breathing in the new scents, counting trees, anything I could to keep myself on task and the past out of mind.
 I was counting fallen catclaw seeds when I crested another hill and spotted a bridge in the valley.
 I hesitated, slowly making my way down.

Did you ever get to sit in with the Hi Rhythm Section?
 These are the questions I wanna answer.
 So, like, I remember the whole Wattstax thing—it was all so casual in Memphis.
 It was like, you wanna go, you wanna play with us this weekend?
 No one understood what it all was gonna mean.
 How could they, right?
 How could they?
 Of course, this was while it was spinning out of control for me.
 Slowly spinning out of control, like I could chart it.
 Like I could write it out on a graph—the Venn diagram of how to have a nervous breakdown.

“You should see some of the horses!” said Imeralda.
 “They are beautiful.” She smiled but at her words Doi’van clearly did not see beautiful animals but a problem.
 “She is correct; most have trained war horses and a few are Dire Steeds.
 I will be honest Rodregas, I am not sure that this will work.
 These warriors are trained in the use of the lance and their war horses will negate your personal advantage in physical might, as your horse is a trail mount.” Doi’van paused and said, “But, the real problem is that you are without plate armor.
 I am not sure how you can survive such a competition.
 The competition with mace or hammer will be only marginally better for you.
 Your body is far stronger than theirs, but not as strong as Night Bronze or Mithril.” Doi’van shook his head.
 “I don’t know how you can compete with simple steel!” “Rodregas,” Doi’van said, “I think you should give up on this task, the Cathedral is busy; and none will know if we simply leave.” Imeralda nodded, but something about the way she stood told Rodregas that she knew he would not do this.
 “So have you done the math?” Rodregas asked.

During this entire time since Brandon was busted, my wife and I had been working to detox him.
 We had him on complete lockdown at the house with no visitors allowed.
 His room and the entire house were still searched daily, including the CD cases and every nook and cranny.
 We used the professional drug tests and we tested him randomly.
 Hopefully he hadn’t found a way to get this drug into our home (again).
 He finished the worst of the drug withdrawals a couple of days after the disastrous intervention.
 When Officer White called, the bust was on.
 I hugged and kissed Brandon and Lisa as if I was about to ship off to a war.
 I felt guilty that I couldn’t say something to my younger son Bryce but he was now back at college and we hadn’t told him what I was doing for Brandon.
 I didn’t want him to worry and I didn’t want him to hate his brother for putting me in this situation.

That would be stupid.
 I stole them, or just read them in the checkout line.
 And about Godzilla being feared, well I was talking to Rusty down the street.

 The one who got thrown into the school dumpster every day at lunchtime by the girls chess team?
 Eugene – That’s the Rusty and it’s called Anime.
 Well Rusty was telling me about how it’s illegal to yell ‘Godzilla’ in a Japanese theatre, like how it’s illegal to yell Fire in an American theatre.
 He says that it’s because the Japanese are that afraid of Godzilla.
 And who can blame them after he ruined Tokyo so many times.
 But anyways Rusty said that most older Japanese people will just soil their shorts even at the mention of their old nemesis.

He smiled.
 "You might have a hard time explaining that."
 Taking her face in his hands, he wiped her cheeks with his thumbs.
 "We'll try again tomorrow, OK?"
 "OK." "I need to go get dressed now--I have to go to work."
 "To work?"
 "Yeah.
 Come on--I'll make you some breakfast, and you'll feel better."
 He took her hand and led her back to the house.
 Her fear had returned.

She’d do well to stick around you.” I frowned.
 “I’ll keep an eye on her,” he promised.
 “You?” I asked, remembering Ruby’s announcement.
 “You’re traveling with us?” “You don’t mind, do you?” “No, of course not,” I gushed.
 It was too eager, so I explained, “Chevelle’s been training me.” “Well, we can certainly help with that.” I grimaced at the thought of Ruby’s training methods.
 “Don’t fret.
 She’s actually very talented.” His smile warmed.
 “An asset, you’ll see.” An asset?
 Ruby came through the door, in a movement that could nearly have been classified as whirling.
 “Come on, Steed.

He was alone.
 He kept walking as he looked my direction, surveying the damage from the fire.
 I was convinced he would know it had been me, but he didn’t stop or even slow.
 It made no sense.
 Why hadn’t he investigated further?
 Was he not here looking for me?
 He was my watcher and I was missing.
 So where else would he be going?
 Before I had, regrettably, torched the documents, I had seen Junnie noted as his contact.
 My pulse sped at the idea that he might be going to her, to get her help in finding me.

Where shall we start?
 Karen – Why don’t we start with your favorite piece of Elizabeth’s?
 Art – That would be difficult, since that particular honor is taken by her rendition of Dog’s Playing Poker.
 Karen – She did a version of Dogs Playing Poker?
 Art – She did indeed, put her own little spin on it.
 Karen – Where is it?
 We should start there.
 Art – That’s the problem, it’s handing from the wall in my living room.
 She gave it to me as a birthday present a couple years ago.
 It was all done in spray paints.

Sweat glistened on the large man’s forehead and his breath was a little labored, but still, he stood.
 Understanding came slowly.
 He had shot lightning from his hands.
 The others nodded appreciatively, but I was having second thoughts about friendship with this man.
 Though not being his friend was probably more dangerous.
 I was shaking my head in disbelief as he turned back to me and bowed.
 He stepped back, taking a seat as the wiry man stepped inside the circle then.
 He nodded to me.
 Grey.
 He was thoughtful for a moment, deciding the best way to display his skill, before finally approaching to offer his hand.

Thank you so much, Rick."
 She flung her arms around him.
 She packed for both of them and finally, unable to find anything else to do, dropped onto the sofa beside him.
 "I'm excited."
 "I hadn't noticed."
 He squeezed her shoulders.
 "Are you ready to watch `E.T.'?"
 He'd rented the movie because of the "E.T."
 ride they'd see at Universal Studios.
 "Yeah.”  She sighed, snuggling closer to him as he pressed the remote button.

Vincent, the other hybrid, attacked with the strength and fury that'd earned him the position of second in his pack, but he hadn't been expecting to face me in this form.
 As a wolf I weighed in at a solid two hundred pounds, but would've still given up more than a hundred pounds to him.
 Now I had at least six inches and seventy-five pounds on my side of the equation, and he was the one pressed onto the defensive as the fight progressed.
 I caught flashes of action from the other fight as we circled each other.
 Jasmin sprang at her opponent, catching her behind the shoulders as Vincent reeled away from me in a shower of blood.
 I'd finally managed a deeper strike on his arm.
 The high-pitched scream of pain as Jasmin began trying to crush her opponent's spine was answered by rapidly-approaching howls.
 Vincent attacked with renewed strength at the promise of reinforcements.
 I was bleeding in a dozen places now, but the rage insulated me from pain and weakness.
 Both sides of my nature were united in hating Vincent.

I need you, Lizzy.” The yearning in his voice was clear on the last part and I was surprised that I ached for him a little, felt for his pain and need.
 He touched me then and I thought I understood when he continued, “We could be together…” Marriage.
 Yes, he wanted to join us.
 I bit my lip, undecided.
 Curiosity was there, too.
 And I couldn’t help but imagine.
 He was unmagical.
 He had no idea what I could do to him, for him, in such an intimate setting.
 What could it hurt, really?
 Sure, I could marry him, but it wouldn’t be real, I knew that.

Might as well enjoy the journey,” Steed said, throwing me a private grin.
 We stopped under the canopy of a red oak and Steed grabbed me as I slid awkwardly from the horse.
 “You may ask him to kneel, Elfreda.” Not that he appeared to mind handling me about the waist to help me down.
 Looking up at him, I pushed the hair away from my face.
 “Yes, well, I guess I should start practicing.” Heat brushed my skin as the fire Chevelle was building flared.
 It returned to its proper size and Chevelle commanded, “Sit, Elfreda.” Steed followed as I walked to a fallen limb by the fire and settled atop the widest part, drawing my legs up from the ground.
 He sat as well, apparently not concerned about who was finding us breakfast.
 Irritation rolled off Chevelle as he ran into the thick line of trees that bordered the clearing.
 In only a moment he was back, carrying three large, white birds.
 “Where is your bow?” I asked.

But by themselves these steps will only mitigate the most pernicious threats to international security.
 They will not provide an effective system for ensuring the peace and security of all nations that is so vitally needed, and now so imminently possible, as a basis for accelerating the political, economic and social development of humankind.
 The end of the Cold War provides us with the opportunity, and pressing global issues provide the urgency, for more significant measures.
 These measures cannot be conceived within the perspective of international security that has dominated our thinking in the post-war period, or from a half-hearted desire to modestly improve what to some still appears an adequate and acceptable system.
 This is an occasion that demands visionary and courageous leadership to usher in a better world.
 The children of the next millennium will judge us by our response.
 Historically, all landmark changes in the international political and security system have been the result of armed conflicts, wars and revolutions.
 In each case the victors who emerged from the ashes of war sought to build on a static formula for enforcing peace in a dynamic world.
 In each case, the arrangements for conflict termination contained a dynamism that would produce the tensions, disputes and conflicts of the future.
 These in-built limitations and imbalances resist adjustment until a new round of fighting sweeps away the old frame work and replaces it with another, fashioned in much the same way.

The man in black nodded, going over the memory in his mind.
 “Could be darker, though,” he said.
 “You need not use memories, but they are easier to project.
 Any thought can be sent to those who slumber.
 After you have practiced, we will try with images you created on your own.”
 The half-orc pulled his robes around him and looked back to the city.
 “When will we assault Woodhaven?” he asked.
 Velixar’s face was an unmoving stone.
 “When did I say we would?”
 “When we first met,” Qurrah said.

“Come on,” Jeremiah said to himself.
 “Hang it all, come on!”
 The half-orc held both swords out wide and roared at the remaining three facing him.
 When they held their ground, Jeremiah could bear the sight no more.
 He charged, screaming the cry of one expecting to die.
 He did not get far though, for a sharp burning pain enveloped his wrist.
 His arm jerked back, and the sudden force spun him to his knees.
 As he knelt there, a voice spat down at him.
 “Pitiful.”
 Jeremiah looked up to see another half-orc clad in ragged robes.

Rodregas knew it would be hard, but he was a hard man and he would have to manage.
 Doi’van nodded, then glanced over to see Imeralda walking over with several of the Grimoires and he added, “I was not angry, in fact, by my people’s standards I was being very easy on you since you are human and can’t handle pain like an Orqui.
 Without pain, you will not reach your potential for quickness and reflexes.
 On the practice field such quickness means fewer bruises.
 On the battle field such reflexes means life and death.” Rodregas nodded, his words held the ring of truth, but he was not looking forward to days of practices and days full of bruises.
 The pattern of their days changed.
 Now after prayer and meditation came first the practice of the Kata, and then the staff and then finally the books.
 The true change came in the evening, the nights were full of such pleasure and joy such as Rodregas had seldom known in his life.
 The rest of summer passed as the most joyful that he had known, as the three started to the Kata and the staff.
 After the staff they moved to the bow where Imeralda became the master.

NO, Seth!
 I saw Seth squirm as Kojas walked towards him.
 I heard him chuckle.
 “Seth,” Kojas said.
 “Seth, oh when will you learn?” Seth groaned and grabbed at his sword, but Kojas kicked it away.
 Then he slashed his sword across Seth’s face.
 I saw the thin blue line well up on his cheek.
 Kojas laughed.
 “You can’t beat me; you can never be safe.” Seth pushed himself up and dove for his sword, which was off to the side.
 Kojas flicked his sword down and I saw Seth flinch.

But I can't go to her.
 And when I can finally run to her, I won't be wearing this ring."
 Slowly she removed the ring from her finger.
 "I love you, Rick.
 I feel torn apart.
 But I have to go home!"
 Rick drew her into his arms, feeling torn apart himself.
 He couldn't bear the thought of losing her.
 But he hated seeing her miserable.
 "Marie," he said softly, stroking her hair, "you've been here for over five weeks.

Yet at the same time, we know that cultural factors can also be a barrier to rapid progress.
 Clinging to the external forms and norms of behaviour which distinguish one culture from another generates resistance to progress, whereas the inner content of culture is a powerful engine for collective achievement.
 Customs are the external form of culture, values are the inner content.
 The customs vary widely, but the values are universal.
 The controversy over the relationship between culture and development is complicated by the fact that development both creates and destroys cultural forms and values.
 Every developmental achievement results in an abandonment of old behaviours and attitudes, and the acceptance of new ones.
 Development destroys survival-based, traditional values and creates achievement-oriented, progressive values.
 Over the last two centuries in countries around the world development has strengthened expansive values that encourage greater freedom, tolerance, individual initiative, self-confidence and self-respect, dynamism, risk-taking, efficiency, punctuality, organization, communication and cooperation, open-mindedness and respect for new ideas, innovation and creativity.
 At the same time development has weakened values that support respect for tradition and hierarchy, seniority and authority, self-effacement and humility, patience and perseverance, generosity and self-sacrifice.
 The nineteenth century tolerated values based on the exploitation by people over people through slavery, colonialism and war, and the domination of nature by man.

“It’s the public art piece we use to climb.” “That makes sense.” She paused.
 “I have to go, dinner.” “Bye Emily,” I whispered.
 “See you tomorrow.” “Bye.” She clicked off.
 After dinner I was laying in bed, my mind spinning.
 I still couldn’t believe where I was going tomorrow.
 To Igneeria.
 Chapter 6
 I opened my eyes the next morning, the sun’s rays shinning through my bedroom window.
 I didn’t roll out of bed for a minute; instead I lay staring at the ceiling trying to prepare my brain for the day ahead.
 I heard my mom and dad walking downstairs, talking excitedly about where they thought I was going to go today.

The old kitchen drudge was still peeling the same potato when he left the kitchen.
 Freshly fed and feeling better for it, Rodregas went across the main hall and entered the door opposite the kitchen into the barracks section of the keep.
 The place was about as messy as he had ever seen it; the normal tidiness demanded by Captain Poir had apparently been put aside in excitement over the chance to take some time off for the celebration.
 His personal bunk and trunk were a mess.
 His good blanket was missing, as was his spare pair of boots and most of his other belongings.
 Clearly, the rest of the guards had thought him dead and made free with his stuff.
 Rodregas reached into the trunk but all that was left in there were a few bits of trash, a few candle stubs, some scraps of paper and a bit of cloth.
 He reached down and picked up the small piece of cloth and held it up.
 He stared for some time at the design sewn into it, and then stuck it into his outer purse.
 He had a strong urge to clean up his bunk and leave the area in the order it deserved, but that would be too big of a hint of what had happened.

All that mattered was the story and the warm drowsiness that increased with each breath.
 "Adjam saw his brother's frustration grow, but he never suspected just how strong it'd become until two hunters brought Inock to bay, and he turned on them.
 Inock killed the first hunter and would have done likewise to the second, but Adjam sprang upon his brother, knocking him away before the second man could be harmed."
 Alec's fingers slowly caressed my stomach as he spoke.
 It should have tickled, but instead it lulled me even further towards oblivion.
 "And thereby the full effect of the Earth's curse was felt.
 Trapped as they were in their beast forms, neither brother could talk to the other, and the resulting confrontation quickly spun out of control.
 Hours later Adjam was left bleeding and broken as his brother disappeared into the night."
 Alec's soothing voice continued on, but I'd lost the ability to listen.
 My mind floated off into visions of a battered wolf who dragged himself over to a brook before collapsing on the bank, streaked with mud.

Was I losing my mind?
 My head came up once more, and the woman gasped.
 It was Junnie.
 Her cloak had fallen, her golden curls a welcome sight.
 Relief flooded me.
 “Junnie!” “Freya,” she murmured, reaching out to stroke a strand of my black hair.
 The shock of seeing her disappeared at the reminder.
 “Are you here for council?
 To collect me?” My voice was colored with the shame of being a criminal.
 Bird-killer.

 She felt guilty for spying on him, but Aurelia was convinced she had no other choice.
 Over the past month, she had grown close to the half-orc Harruq Tun, and with that closeness was danger.
 She saw only a goofy young man while Dieredon swore she met with a killer.
 Only one of them could be right, but who?
 Perhaps not, she wondered.
 Perhaps she saw the elf in Harruq while Dieredon saw the orc.
 The kindest man might become a brute when surrounded by other brutes.
 When Harruq was with his brother, or the strange man in black, how then did he behave?

“How much I wish for your pride to suffer.” Magical energy rippled out of him and tore across the air.
 The elf whirled, sensing the incoming invisible blow.
 Only a tiny part hit his shoulder, immediately encasing it in ice.
 Then Harruq was upon him, slashing recklessly.
 Ahrqur batted his sword left and right, then jumped as Harruq swung back in a scissor-cut that should have shredded his waist.
 The elf landed atop one of his couches, balancing with ease.
 “What reason do you have to kill me?” the elf asked.
 “Are you here for money?
 I could pay you twice the pittance you work for.”
 “Just shut up,” Harruq said, hurling Salvation across the room.

We'd partially unpacked things to get my bedspread out, so everything else went pretty quickly.
 My room wasn't particularly large, but someone had put a long shelf around the top of the room, and the closet had more storage space than my room back home.
 My meager belongings quickly found new homes.
 I looked one last time at the box holding my clothes, and then sighed and shoved it under the bed.
 My unpacking was all done, which meant I had to go back to my homework.
 At least now I could listen to my music while I studied.
 Fifteen minutes later I was safely ensconced in my room listening to the London Cast version of Les Misérables as I tried to work through my backlog of Algebra assignments.
 When I finally surfaced from orders of operation as the sun started setting, I was pleasantly surprised things had gone so well.
 As masochistic as it sounded, I actually enjoyed settling down with a set of academic problems, and working my way through them.
 Sometimes I entered a Zen-like state where everything else in the world just dropped away.

His face was masked with one emotion, one that made me vow to myself that I would find out what he was hiding, what he was keeping a secret.
 That emotion was not Seth, not the one I knew.
 It made me feel the same way and I didn’t know why.
 Fear.
 Chapter 5
 The water war continued with us getting them and them getting us.
 We attacked them with a pool, and they threw water balloons at us while we were on bikes.
 It was pretty simple, but the whole time all I noticed was Seth.
 He wasn’t the same to me anymore; he always had this mask on his face, hiding himself from the rest of us.
 I had to find out what was wrong, and soon.

Shivers ran down my spine.
 3… I felt cold, like being dipped in ice water.
 The breeze picked up even harder.
 2… I was hollow and could probably see my own body if I opened my eyes.
 But I could never get the courage to do that.
 1… The wind died.
 My body felt normal except it was different.
 I opened my eyes and looked over to where I just had been or still was.
 My human body slightly glowed as it sat in meditation under the tree.
 It didn’t move.

There was an awkward moment until Doi’van appeared at the door.
 He walked with the help of a tall walking stick.
 His arm and side were both covered in bandages.
 Durien followed him in with a heavy stool, which Doi’van quickly sat down on.
 The old healer immediately left the room.
 “Rodregas, you look much better than last I saw you.
 But what is so important that it takes me away from a very important nap?” Doi’van’s body looked worse for the wear, but his eyes showed his natural curiosity and intelligence.
 Rodregas did not think he actually minded coming over to his room.
 Rodregas smiled and thought that given the way Doi’van talked about pain when training them with the staff, that he must be immune to mere pain anyhow.
 Imeralda repeated Jordaan’s question.

 These guys were great about showing you the chords, showing you how to use your tuning to get a personal sound out of your instrument.
 I advanced rapidly.

 I mean, I was 12, 13.
 And I was playing the blues,  A better education I cannot imagine.
 I started buying all the blues records I could find.
 There were great outlets for records back then.

 The string vanished from the bow, spikes pierced the front, and out came the long blades at each side.
 “You foolish mortal,” Velixar said.
 His voice was far deeper than before, less like a man and more like a demon.
 “I do not fear your steel.”
 Pale hands shot upward, hooked in strange formations.
 Dieredon stabbed a long blade straight at the man’s throat.
 The blade halted halfway there, crashing against an invisible barrier.
 The elf struck again, this time lower.
 Velixar’s image rippled as if beneath water, his body protected by some unseen wall.

It was dark, but he could see in the dim light of the moon that someone was shoving a knife into his belly.
 He knew that in the next couple of seconds, his actions would decide his fate.
 He was bleeding, so he would be losing strength as well.
 Whoever his assailants were, they had him trapped.
 Rodregas violently kicked out with one leg, but his stabbing attacker avoided the blow.
 He did let up on the knife for a second though.
 Instead of following up, Rodregas used the momentum of his kick to swing his body sideways.
 Skilled, close up fighting was all about leverage.
 Instead of resisting the attacker’s strength Rodregas pushed down on the earth with his hands and lifted his body up and to the side, curling the leg he had kicked out underneath.
 He planted his foot under his body.

He knew that the Guild had a representative at the Cathedral but had not expected him to be so closely watching the registration table.
 Rodregas fell into old habits of survival.
 He kept his eyes to himself and let himself feel the tiredness of travel on the road.
 When it became his turn, Rodregas stood there silently.
 The knight, an older man with a short gray beard, who was missing his left hand, waved him forward.
 The Knight Captain slowly looked up at the tall figure before him and after a quick examination went to the oddly mismatched pair that stood at each shoulder.
 “You are a squire who wishes to register for the tournament?” asked the Knight Captain.
 While the Knight had probably asked this to a lot of people that day, his tone suggested real curiosity.
 Rodregas grunted acknowledgment and dropped his hand with the Patch of his Knightly Chapter in it.
 The Knight Captain picked it up and studied the detailed patterns woven into the fabric.

Restoration of a common economic space – which is being criticized internationally as a surrender of sovereignty to Russia at a time when both Western Europe and North America are striving for closer economic union – could immediately restore most of that lost output.
 The advantages of cooperation between republics needs to be care fully examined.
 A study should be conducted by a credible institution to estimate the economic losses incurred by the break-up of the common economic space between the former Soviet re publics and to assess the benefits of restoring an economic union in some form.
 It should estimate overall economic growth and living standards for each republic over the next five years operating within and outside the economic union.
 This study can serve as a powerful argument for closer cooperation among the republics.
 The study can be undertaken at very low cost by a consortium of researchers from different research institutes within the Commonwealth of Independent States.
 5.Privatize and develop road transport: Transportation is a major bottleneck to development of a market economy in much of the region.
 Under the centrally planned system, most freight was hauled by trains over main routes to large cities for distribution in bulk by huge government procurement agencies.
 Under a market system, millions of small producers and consumers must be free to buy or sell wherever the price is most attractive.
 This requires a vast proliferation of small goods transporters in the private sector, which are rare in many countries today.

“Should I order the birthday celebration milord?” asked the captain.
 The coming celebration had been the talk of speculation for months as well as the object of more than a little betting among the guards.
 Rodregas nodded, his thoughts swirling as he realized that he could use the celebration to his benefit.
 Without looking at the captain he walked toward the stairway, and the captain followed close behind him.
 At the door Rodregas took a deep breath and said, “Captain, that ceremony did not go smoothly, but the gods once again proved to favor me, and I wish to be generous with the birthday ceremony.
 Tell the purser to pay everyone an extra month’s wages today and give everyone a week off to spend as they wish.
 Make sure you tell Purser Stevents to be generous.
 I want all staff rewarded, even the kitchen drudges.” He finished, hoping it did not sound as halting and made up as he knew it to be.
 “Yes, sir,” replied Captain Poir, his expression going from a guarded concern to enthusiasm.
 He seemed reassured when Rodregas mentioned Stevents.

For the first time I felt guilty about making things harder for Mom.
 Surely there was something I could have done to help out, even considering the attacks.
 "They can't do that, can they?
 I mean, if they told you that you had the job they can't take it away, can they?"
 Mom rooted around in a half empty box until she found some tissues, it wasn't the first one she'd been through this afternoon.
 "I didn't think so, but Mr. Peters claims there was never any contract signed and I can't find our copy in any of the boxes."
 "Mom, what are we going to do?
 Where will we go if they kick us out?"
 She smoothed my hair back from my face.
 "Don't worry about that, sweetie.

My equilibrium seemed to have returned, so I took a few unsteady steps around to the back of the truck.
 If I didn't return with a box soon Mom would rush out expecting the worst.
 Unless she got caught up visualizing some new project, in which case it would be hours before she thought to come check on me.
 We'd moved the beds and most of the other heavy items in earlier, which helped explain my exhaustion, but that didn't make the pile of remaining items in the back of the truck any less foreboding.
 I decided to take the easy way out, and picked up a couple of blanket-wrapped mirrors.
 I didn't unwrap either of them.
 That was dangerous too.
 The face that'd look back out of the glass would look almost more like hers than mine.
 Shoulder-length blond hair and blue eyes still seemed to be all the rage, but mine were ruined by pale skin that burned instead of tanning, and a build that had retained its baby fat long after most of the other girls had started slimming down.
 Those extra inches had evaporated recently, but of course it couldn't be a cause for celebration.

“Well, he’s dead now, so we’ll never know,” Harruq said, tossing the blade onto the floor.
 Qurrah, however, was far from dismayed.
 He grinned at his brother and then spoke in his hissing voice.
 “Would you like to have a conversation with our dear old dad?” he asked.

 The body of Ahrqur Tun’del lay atop several strange markings and shapes drawn in the dirt.
 He remained wrapped in the blankets and sheets the two half-orcs had used to smuggle him out of his house.
 The wrappings provided a bit of relief against the growing smell of death that already permeated their home.

Rick took both her hands in his.
 "I would never do anything to hurt you."
 "I know."
 He raised her hand to his lips.
 "I just can't imagine not having you here with me."
 She squeezed his hands.
 "I don't belong here, Rick.

The great Lion twitched his ears to the right.
 He had expected his nemesis, the White Stag, but instead walked a woman.
 Her long legs somehow managed to keep pace with him.
 Her hair, as golden as his own fur, rained down her curved back; she wore a glowing short white shift adorned with many pouches.
 “Why do you hunt with me, Goddess?” The Lion growled.
 The Goddess Blodeuwedd answered, “I am proud of you.
 I will be truthful, I shared my favor with you simply as a matter of convenience.
 I hoped you might succeed.
 I did not think you would live, much less add to your power and gather more hunters to our pride.” The great Lion shook his head, the ways of the winds and the speech of gods were the same, fickle and not to be truly understood.
 Yet he sensed that somehow the words sounded fair and right in some way that he could not really explain.

I was just self-aware enough to hope I'd remember it all when I awoke in the morning.
 Chapter 5 It was a good thing I'd started school in the middle of the week.
 If I'd gone to school the next day after all the drama of learning about our mortgage problems I probably would have had a nervous breakdown.
 As it was, I was essentially worthless all weekend.
 I tried to warn Mom about the animals that'd mauled the kids from school, but she told me she was already aware of the incident and left before I could draw her into a discussion of what we should do about the bank.
 I saw her for maybe a total of three hours during the entire two days.
 Even I knew it was wasted effort.
 If Mom somehow beat the odds, it still wasn't going to result in the kind of money we'd need to save our house.
 Not in the next two or three weeks at least.
 It felt like my whole world had just disappeared down a drain.

A surge of guilt splashed around inside me at the thought, but it was a realization I'd made weeks ago.
 By now some of the sharper edges to the emotion had worn away.
 I shrugged, dropping my book and binder on the floor next to my bed.
 Dwelling on the guilt would just make me think about why I felt guilty in the first place.
 I'd find myself on the floor with no memory of how I'd gotten there.
 By the time I'd brushed my teeth and finished the rest of my nightly ritual, my mind was wholly in the present, and I was starting to get a little depressed.
 I'd never particularly fit in back home, but there'd been enough other people in various fringe groups that I'd always felt like I had somewhere to go if I ever wanted more friends.
 I would've had to play a role to a certain extent, which was why I'd never made the effort, but the option had always been there.
 It didn't look like that'd be a possibility in Sanctuary.
 In an entire day I'd had exactly one person try and befriend me.

It was inside, a screaming, terrible howl coming from my ears.
 I tried to force my eyes open, hoping someone would help me, but they were just standing there, chest to chest, arguing.
 Did they not see me?
 I ached to scream for help, but couldn’t get a sound out, couldn’t breathe.
 They leaned toward each other, oblivious to anything else.
 My eyes closed as I curled into a ball.
 The seconds dragged on and I began to wonder if I would die.
 And then it stopped.
 I sucked in a ragged breath, then another.
 I seemed fine, maybe a little dizzy, but otherwise it was gone.

She said she's already arranged for a charter plane out of St. George.
 If I leave in the next ten minutes, we can make the flight out of Salt Lake International with something like half an hour to spare."
 We both sat there in silence for a few seconds as everything sank in, and then Mom exploded into motion.
 She ran downstairs to repack her photography equipment, all the while yelling upstairs to verify that I'd packed all of the other essentials she was going to need.
 Almost before I'd even finished assimilating how quickly Alec had pulled everything together, Mom was backing down the lane as I waved goodbye.
 Alec appeared within thirty seconds of Mom's departure, Isaac close behind him.
 "We need to go.
 One of Brandon's people just got close enough to smell us.
 They left before we could tell for sure who it was, but the odds of them coming back with lots of help just went through the roof.
 If we're still around when they do, things will get ugly."

If a book proves difficult, like Kierkegaard's Works of Love, all the better.
 My brain needs the exercise.
 Since reading and wrestling with Brother Lawrence, I often I feel like a wanderer whose spirit longs for home, the way I felt upon waking long ago in the Desert Inn from a vision of heaven.
 I tried to drop writing a couple priority levels, but that move didn't work.
 As usual, a few days without writing, gloom started to creep in.
 So I boosted writing back to number four.
 Housekeeping rose a level, because I've discovered, like Olga did, that chores can be a swell time for contemplation.
 If you come to visit, you might find me scrubbing a floor, or dicing beats, while listening to my I-pod.
 If I don't notice your approach and look as if I'm talking to myself, don't worry.
 I'm probably communing with Jesus, though he may be in disguise.

He rolled his eyes and wrapped an arm around my shoulder.
 We sat there in silence and I leaned on his shoulder.
 We both stopped shivering as we stared at the sky.
 “Seth, I’m scared,” I whispered.
 “What happens if something goes wrong?” “Nothing will go wrong,” he said fiercely.
 “I won’t let it happen.” I closed my eyes.
 “I keep seeing what happened that night.” “It’ll go away,” he said.
 There was a long silence.
 “This is too awkward and I don’t like the silence.
 It’s not normal for us.” I laughed.

“We can figure out what to do next when we wake up.” I nodded sleepily and laid down on the hard ground.
 I closed my eyes, feeling a strange tiredness come over me.
 I barely heard Seth mumbled, “I don't like our situation at all.” That night, I had the weirdest dream.
 I was standing on a dark cliff, the eerie moon high in the sky.
 The wind whipped at my hair, causing me to see the green strands in front of my eyes.
 The cold nipped at my cheeks and nose, which I tried to rub back to warmth.
 I stood at the edge of the cliff and gasped when I looked down.
 Underneath me, hundreds of monsters gathered around a fight.
 I couldn’t see who was fighting inside because a swamp troll blocked my view, but I knew it was brutal the way they whooped at a screech of pain.
 I wanted to close my eyes and look away, but I was so curious to see what was going on, that I couldn’t.

She assured him she was all his.
 For some weeks, he allowed her to rest on that answer, but more and more she became uneasy with it, until she realized she didn’t by any means belong entirely to God.
 Most of her thoughts, concerns and energies went to her family.
 She was the mom of three wonderful kids and the wife of a loving husband.
 In horror, she returned to intense and persistent prayer, telling God he couldn’t possibly mean she should leave her family, could he?
 Rather than reply with words, he used silence, like Tae Kwon Do Master Jeong used to do when one of us students offered an excuse for not training often enough.
 For weeks she waited, listened, and prayed God would at last reply that he had only been using the method through which he tested Abraham’s willingness to obey at any cost.
 Once she declared herself ready to forsake her family, he would release her from the need to do so.
 But he didn’t release her.
 She gathered together her husband and kids, all of whom she adored and treasured.

Ready and able for a morning adventure.” As he approached, he glanced at me and then Chevelle, still close beside me.
 “We can get an early start.” He lifted a pack from beside the fire and said, “Bluebell?” I stood, following this stranger without question, not missing the irritation on Chevelle’s face.
 He unclasped the pack to roll the blankets out with a flip, smiling and nodding good evening before stepping away from my hastily constructed hut.
 I unlaced my vest and threw it down, kicked off my shoes and fell into the blankets, stretching happily to finally have something like an actual bed.
 The conversation outside quieted and I slipped off to sleep, trying not to think about my capture and coming return to the village.
 “Freya.” A low voice broke into my dreams of gently rolling hills and soft gray stone.
 I peered through slitted eyes to see Chevelle standing outside the entrance, back to me as he watched a dull red horizon.
 I sat up, lacing the vest over the thin material of my blouse, and slid on my shoes to join him.
 “It’s dawn,” I complained.
 “And good morning, sunshine,” Steed called from atop a large, black stallion.

When they returned to their blanket an hour later, she was tired enough to be talked into sunbathing for a while.
 "Put some of this lotion all over your skin so you won't get burned."
 Rick handed her a bottle.
 "Mmm.
 It smells like coconut pie."
 She rubbed it all over her exposed skin and then stretched out on her stomach.
 Rick took the bottle.
 "I'll rub some on your back."
 "Oh."
 She hadn't even thought about that.

** The next morning played out essentially the same as the day before.
 I awoke to an empty house, and then hurried to get ready and down to the bus stop so I wouldn't be stranded if nobody else showed up to give me a ride into school.
 Brandon smiled as he pulled up and found me patiently waiting for the school bus.
 "One of these days you're going to go ahead and wait for me at your house, and then I'll know you finally trust me."
 I didn't feel much like playful banter, but I marshaled a semi-convincing smile and gave it my best go.
 "Oh, I trust you, I just know that you've got more important things to worry about.
 One of these times you'll either forget to come get me, or you'll forget to tell me you're not coming by anymore."
 Brandon let the silence build for several seconds.
 "I'd try and convince you I'm not going to do any of that to you, but I suspect that's just going to take time."
 I was busy kicking myself for having cast such a pall over the morning, when Brandon sighed.

The sudden spike was enough to make my hair stand on end, but Jim Hansen hurried by without any indication there was something out of the ordinary.
 "You're in our way, half-breed."
 I felt Alec's grasp tighten slightly, but considering the crushing strength he was capable of, it was the closest thing imaginable to a non-response.
 Brandon was coming up behind Vincent, as Alec reached up and placed his own hand on Vincent's chest, with another, stronger flash of power.
 The ripple of skin and bone was so quick for a second I couldn't believe what I was seeing, but there it was.
 Alec's hand and fingers had elongated, turning into a hairless replica of the deadly claw that'd terrified me just a few days before.
 Vincent's bulk was such that it screened Alec's movements from passersby, as those razor-sharp claws sank just the barest distance into his chest.
 Alec spoke for the first time, and the even tone of his words was a stark contrast to the winds of power that seemed almost ready to throw me across the hall.
 "You forget yourself, mutt.
 As the leader of another pack, I'm due more respect than that.

“Knock her out.
 Do something.
 She’s going to crack.” Yes, crack.
 That was a good word for it.

 No, being torn.

 She would drug me.
 I didn’t want that.
 I didn’t want that ever again.

Author’s hedge:  Now, friends, the following work, while incorporating much history and Memphis mythology into its olio, is, as they say, a work of fiction.
 If there are names of actual people herein, those people are not to be held responsible for the author’s prevarications, and the use of their names was done with necromancy and love.
 So, all is not what it seems and all that seems to not be what it seems may be what it seems.
 In short, the author is a confused and deeply troubled person.
 Nevertheless, this is a jape.
 Nevertheless, this is fiction fiction fiction.

We were back at the house in what seemed like a heartbeat.
 Steed watched the village from the front room.
 Ruby sat with me on her bed, the door closed.
 “This will calm you,” she said.
 A sprinkle of glitter hit my face before I had the chance to protest.
 “Just a touch,” she assured me, “just a touch.” It was too late.
 The dust had already taken effect.
 I relaxed onto the bed, just as Ruby did the same beside me.
 We stared at her ceiling unspeaking for an immeasurable amount of time.
 I rolled on my side toward her, dimly irritated she’d poisoned me again.

The wind blew through them, shifting their hair and whistling through the holes in their bodies.
 The half- orc said nothing, just stared at the carnage and the servants of his master as he waited for Qurrah.
 The mindless rage that had consumed him slowly faded.
 By the time his brother arrived, it was all but a memory.
 “The undead took them,” Qurrah said, his breath quick and shallow.
 “Velixar did not trust us.”
 “I trust little,” Velixar said, stepping through the line of his servants.
 “The truth is I do not take risks.
 If any survived you would have been identified and my plans ruined.”
 Both brothers bowed to their master.

If you love Broken, you can get a free copy of the next book, Torn, by signing up for the author's mailing list.
 Chapter 1 Stepping back out into the relentless desert sun, I once again wished we were still back in Minnesota, or at least that we were done moving.
 Then again I might as well have been wishing that Mom had decided on somewhere other than Utah, or that we'd had some long-lost relative die and leave us a small fortune, or even better that Dad and Cindi...
 The thought was much too dangerous to complete.
 My breathing had already sped up, and my balance degenerated so quickly it was a small miracle I made it over to the U-Haul before I keeled over.
 I'd hated the battered vehicle that had spent the last two days carrying us west across I-80.
 It was hard to keep up the feeling though when it was the only thing protecting me from a concussion.
 Half of the horizon was green and beautiful, not land-of-ten-thousand-lakes beautiful, but still not bad.
 I, of course, ended up on the wrong side of the truck; barren dirt and rocks, only occasionally relieved by scrubby plant life, as far as the eye could see.
 I still didn't buy into my mom's oft-repeated claim.

 Don’t do it again or ill hand you over to your intended victims.

"I'm not tired, I promise."
 His eyebrow arched in disbelief as I pulled him down onto the bed, and I found myself admitting the truth.
 "Okay, I might be a little tired, but it isn't a big deal.
 I want to spend as much time with you as possible.
 After all, it isn't like I'm going to be able to really get much rest between now and whenever we need to leave for the challenge."
 His wonderfully expressive face froze into the stony mask he wore so often with the rest of the world.
 "You weren't planning on bringing me, were you?"
 "It's not safe, Adri.

They reveled in bloodshed, warred against men who followed a false god.
 I offer you a chance to do as you were meant to and serve Karak.
 Answer me this question, half-orc.
 Do you love your brother?”
 A chill ran through his spine.
 He glanced to Qurrah, who still knelt.
 His eyes were focused on him.
 In them, he saw pride.
 “Aye, I do,” Harruq said.
 “I would do anything for him.”

“We just exterminate the pests.” “You’re a half-ling!
 You’re the bridge to our world.
 Now if you don’t mind we would like to finish you now, and bring you to the King.” The dwarf said politely and snickered, approaching me.
 I backed up slowly.
 “Uh, I mind a lot actually.” I said quickly but I guess they didn’t really want my opinion.
 Emily jumped out from behind the trees and lifted a flame.
 She twirled it around with the movement of her hands and shot it at the nearest dwarf.
 That started what seemed like a war.
 All the dwarfs scrambled towards us and I simply shot them and Emily fried them.
 Then Jason and Seth dissolved from the shadows and entered the clearing.

The rest of the kids at the table were listening just as intensely, all except for the brunette on Brandon's left who was looking in our direction.
 My face pulled back in a smile, I even brought my hand partway up in a wave before I realized I recognized her.
 It was the trendy girl from the office, and she apparently still didn't like me.
 I felt my face get even hotter, only now I was both angry and embarrassed.
 It was a relief to sink down into a chair with my back to Brandon and his friends.
 Strangely enough, Britney also being so obviously uncomfortable helped calm me down.
 "Okay, out with it, why is this such a big deal?"
 Britney shifted back and forth in her seat for a couple of seconds before leaning in to whisper.
 "It really shouldn't be a big deal, but everyone around here acts like it's taboo.
 Two hikers were killed by some kind of wild animal a few months ago."

Another time I will explain.”
 The two grew quiet, and they stared at the fire as the time passed.
 At last, when Harruq was sure Qurrah would not bring up the subject, he spoke.
 “About the guards,” he said.
 “You think they’re telling the truth?”
 Qurrah glanced up.
 “About the elven blood in us?”
 “Yeah.”
 Qurrah chuckled, but it was mirthless.
 “I do, and it does not surprise me as much as it should.

My father’s dad was a butcher, his wife a seamstress.
 My mother’s dad was an oil rig grunt of American-Indian decent, and his wife, a meek submissive homemaker.
 Neither parent thought the other was good enough for their child, let alone the fact that they were both still children.
 Once the reason for the marriage was revealed, their parents accepted it as best as they could.
 My father’s parents arranged for them to live together in a small home while they finished school and awaited the birth of their baby.
 It was the late fifties and a pregnant teenager was an embarrassment.
 Shame followed the couple wherever they went.
 Thomas Richard was born on a cold December day to parents who were children themselves.
 I followed just 13 months later, and another brother was born 14 months later and died almost immediately after his birth.
 My mother at 20 years old had two toddlers and had to accept the death of her third baby.

*** “Hurry up Jason, you’re so slow!” Emily yelled at him.
 Jason walked the rest of the way up the hill and bent over to catch his breath.
 “We've been walking all day and you're not tired?” “Nope, I've got dancer muscles.” Jason sat on the ground.
 “Well, I have artist muscles and those are in my hands.” Emily rolled her eyes.
 “Then walk on your hands.” “No way!” he said.
 “Fine, then don't complain.” She climbed into a small tree that was near the cliff she had spotted.
 She leaned back and let out a sigh of relief.
 Her legs were killing her but she wasn't going to tell Jason that.
 He got up and sat at the base of the tree.
 “You had to take the good tree?” She motioned around.

On the bottom shelf he found a nice pair of boots, not of AElven make.
 Attached were matching grieves, armor designed to protect the lower leg., and a pair of armored gauntlets to compete the set.
 All ended up on the bed.
 Nothing else of interest was in the wardrobe.
 Though the two fanciest robes both heavily embroidered and of Western Silk, also went to the bed.
 Next, he went to the trunk which was made of High Cedar wood and which matched the large wardrobe, but was much more portable.
 Unfortunately, the only items of use in it were several blankets of good quality wool.
 The remaining contents consisted of drawings, pictures and other personal items.
 Rodregas dumped the trunk contents on the floor, sandwiched the armor in the blankets and loaded up the trunk.
 How he was going to cart the trunk out of the tower he did not yet know.

As I started to open it, I knocked one of his bags over and went to pick it up.
 The flap was loose and a piece of familiar fabric hung out.
 I glanced over my shoulder to be sure Ruby wasn’t watching, and opened the bag to find the fabric-wrapped package she’d handed to Chevelle our first day here.
 The package he’d traded my stone for.
 I pulled the material back to reveal a leather-bound book.
 Afraid Ruby would catch me, I slid the book into my own pack and took it to my room.
 I’d already been in trouble for stealing one book but this was technically mine.
 It had been swapped for my ruby.
 I was careful anyway, pretending to lie down and placing the book where I could quickly cover it if I were caught.
 I ran my fingers over the dark leather cover, tracing the scripted V etched there.

Harruq’s gut screamed against the idea, but in the end, he listened to his brother.
 He drew his swords and gave chase.
 Qurrah waited until Harruq was around the corner before taking out one of his small glass vials.
 Before he could pull the cork off the top, he heard a voice speak.
 “So many dead by your hands yet a single arrow nearly takes your life?”
 The half-orc froze, the vial clutched in his hands.
 An elf emerged from behind the building, his body decorated in a brilliant green cloak and silvery armor.
 It was the same elf who had fired the first warning shot to Antonil before the entire battle had begun.
 “I am but a poor outcast,” Qurrah said, hiding the handle of the whip underneath the palm of his hand.
 The coiled leather vibrated, hungering for blood.

Seth fell to his knees, holding his midsection.
 His sword fell out of his grip and to the ground.
 Kojas grinned in triumph and kicked Seth to the ground.
 I screamed again, when he didn’t move.
 “At last,” Kojas breathed.
 “Monster!” I cried.
 “You’re a monster!” He didn’t answer me.
 I looked up the hill to see a bunch of faery jerks running down the hill towards us.
 Emily stood in front of Jason and raised her hands.
 I notched an arrow and aimed.

“Jazell...” “What?” I called.
 “What do you want?” “Jazell...” the voice whispered again.
 “Jazell.” “What?” I screamed into the trees.
 “What do you want?
 Why do you have to repeat my name over and over again, it's creepy.” “Jazell, beware,” it whispered again.
 “Beware.” I stomped my foot in frustration and yelled, “Beware of what?” “Beware,” it mumbled back.
 “Beware of the shadows.” “What?” I said, startled.
 “I know how scary shadows are and I don't need you to tell me that.” “Jazell...” “That's it,” I said angrily.
 “I'm getting an answer for once.” I ran towards the voice, which was hard because it sounded like it was everywhere.
 A bright light flashed and I saw a ghost-like girl disappear in the darkness.

 "You have quite an imagination."
 "Could we go there sometime?
 You and I?"
 He smiled down at her.
 "An island cruise would be much nicer, I'm sure.
 In fact, I think it would make a lovely honeymoon trip."
 If her heart did one more somersault today, it was going to fall right into her stomach.
 Marie and Davis spent the next day with her family, and he promised to take her out for dinner and dancing again next Saturday.
 She suspected that he might propose soon.

“His spirit will be bound to mine,” Qurrah said, sitting on his knees before the body.
 His eyes were closed and his hands atop Ahrqur’s head.
 “Any question you or I ask he must answer truthfully.
 Do not be disturbed by the sound he first makes.
 Spirits brought back into our world rarely enjoy the journey.”
 Harruq nodded, dressed in his black armor.
 They did not have much time before Velixar’s dark cloud arrived.
 They could not rush, but nor could they dawdle.
 Qurrah inhaled deeply and began casting his spell.
 The words of magic were similar to those when he raised the eight corpses back in Cornrows.

A wall of water swirled about her, flowing from the otherwise dry dirt street.
 She sent it forward, just as tall and high as Velixar’s.
 The two met in a thunderous roar, intermixing in a maelstrom of darkness, water, and air.
 Then they both dissolved, their magic spent.
 Aurelia held back tears.
 Velixar’s magic had peeled the flesh from the elves’ bodies.
 Blood leaked through muscle and tendon, and their innards spilled from their abdomens.
 She hoped they died instantly, but she knew better.
 They had suffered tremendously.
 “You monster,” she shouted.

"I should probably make sure she isn't waiting somewhere for me.
 That's probably half of why she's so mad.
 I was so out of things yesterday I didn't think to let her know I was headed home with you."
 Rachel looked for a moment like she wanted to disagree, but she nodded, in the kind of noncommittal way people use when they don't really agree, but are ready to let you make your own mistakes.
 Rachel pulled her books together, and then followed me through the door, James two steps behind, and looking, amazingly enough, even more surly than he had a few seconds before.
 Rachel didn't seem to be one of those people who always had to be talking about something, but even so, two minutes of silence were enough to leave me scrambling for something to talk about.
 "Thanks for telling me about Les Misérables.
 I mean, I should have said thanks yesterday, but I really do appreciate you thinking of me.
 It was really nice."
 Rachel's eyes lit up brighter than I'd seen them in a while.

A scrying eye was upon him, now, and he was losing.
 It felt like an arrow pierced his mind, and through it words seeped into his head.
 _Run.
 Die.
 Collapse.
 Fear.
 Failure._
 An apparition swirled before him, blacker than the shadows, red eyes smoldering.
 Its rank claws touched his face, turning the sweat on his brow to ice.
 The arrow squirmed deeper.

The rapidly falling value of local currencies minimized their utility as a medium of exchange.
 Agricultural as well as industrial enterprises seeking a stable medium in which to hold their wealth increasingly resorted to hoarding marketable, non-perishable commodities such as food grains or converting local currency into foreign money wherever possible.
 This was particularly devastating for agriculture, where higher production was desperately needed to meet consumer demand and reduce dependence on food imports.
 The breakdown of the local currency as an effective medium of exchange was accompanied by an unfavourable shift in the terms of trade between agriculture and industry, resulting from the near-monopolistic position both of the suppliers of farm inputs, especially fertilizers and farm machinery, and the processing units that purchased farm produce, such as dairies and meat processing plants.
 Together, these factors precipitated a rapid fall in farm production and food availability.
 There can be no solution to the food problem without first establishing a stable medium of exchange.
 5.Macro-level policy must be complemented by micro-level change: Putting in place the right macro-level policies may be necessary, but it is far from sufficient to create a functioning market.
 The governments of the region have been so preoccupied with ‘re-engineering’ their economic and political systems and with meeting the conditions to attract foreign aid and investment that they have tended to over look the many essential and practical steps needed to implement the reforms on the ground.
 Even if governments had been able to get all the laws and economic policies ‘right’ the first time, there is no assurance that the actual impact on the people would have been less harsh than it has been.
 The so-called ‘shock therapy’ strategy pursued by these countries has been widely criticized for its severity and seeming indifference to social costs.

 I swayed just a little.
 Today it didn't seem quite as bad, as long as I didn't think of her actual name.
 "Mom, I don't want to be late.

 Can we wait to celebrate until after school?"
 Now it was her turn to look guilty and fidget just a little bit.

 I didn't have to pretend to be hurt and disappointed.
 Even knowing that Alec was everything I'd thought Brandon was, I still felt used and disappointed.
 "I just wasn't what he was looking for.

 Mom crossed the distance from the window and wrapped her arms around me.

The increase in the dollar output of developing countries was actually bigger than that of the most economically advanced nations in 1992 and 1993, and this trend is expected to continue.
 Measured in terms of purchasing power parity, developing countries now represent more than one-third of the world economy.
 More than 40 per cent of US exports now go to developing countries and two-thirds of the increase in US exports in recent years has gone to these nations.
 The rising expectations and upward mobility of millions of people in developing countries represent a vast potential source of demand, higher incomes and jobs for the West.
 Increasing incomes among the poorest countries has the greatest multiplier effect on global aggregate demand, because even small increments in per capita income can lead to large increases in the number of households with incomes above the threshold for buying consumer goods.
 Asia is expected to generate half the growth in gross world product and world trade during the 1990s.
 This region will have one billion consumers of televisions, refrigerators and motor vehicles by the year 2000 and a rising appetite for both imported consumer and capital goods.
 East Asia alone, excluding Japan and China, will spend about $900 billion on infrastructure between 1992 and 2000.
 During this decade, China and India will add 21,000 megawatts of electricity generation every year and more telephone switching capacity than the United States and Japan combined.
 Latin America’s annual requirements for investment in power, water and sewage, telecommunications and transport infrastructure are estimated at $60 billion.

“Well fought,” he said.
 An arrow clanged against his sword and ricocheted off.
 “A warning for your honor,” said a camouflaged elf as he stepped out from behind a door.
 A second arrow followed the first, thudding against Antonil’s shield.
 “A second out of respect.” He drew a third.
 The guard captain charged, his shield leading.
 While his upper body was covered, nothing stopped the arrow from flying underneath and piercing through the metal greaves protecting his shins.
 Antonil stumbled, pain flaring up his right leg.
 He forced himself to continue running.
 If he could close the gap, the bow would prove no match for his longsword.

According to my vocabulary, if we adore something, we are drawn to it and resist separation.
 Its presence comforts, inspires, provides us with hope and meaning.
 The thought of losing it may terrify or leave us in despair.
 I feel all that about my kids.
 I have felt somewhat the same about a few others, at least for a time.
 But I would be lying if I claimed to feel all that about God.
 My problem invites the question: how can I adore God when I don’t quite know what to make of him?
 I hear and read that he’s a person, and a spirit, who resides everywhere, outside and in us.
 I understand that if my imagination is too small to fathom God as a whole, which of course it is, I can grasp who God is by observing the qualities, nature, and actions of Christ.
 But though I have read, listened, prayed, and pondered about Jesus for dozens of years, in all honesty, given my definition, I can't claim to adore him either.

The dread in his heart was gone; it had no place in the heart of a lion.
 While no speeches had started the other matches, for the first time Rodregas saw the Grand Marshal himself step forward.
 His name was Faurrenida.
 The Grand Marshal was an older man and not a pretty one; his face had more scars than anything else.
 He spoke with a rough voice like he was permanently hoarse from barking commands.
 “Today,” he yelled out, “we have a match of men and women who are ready to become knights, to be the very Champions of the Gods on this world.
 They are all worthy, but there can be only one new knight this day.” Faurrenida looked around slowly catching each of them by the eye.
 Rodregas was caught up in the commanding presence of the man.
 “To the Order and to the Celestials!” his voice was half command and half prayer.
 Everyone including combatants and those watching from wall and window responded, so that the words swirled around the arena.

Africa can benefit enormously by applying strategies that have worked in Asia.
 The ‘Prosperity 2000’ programme evolved by ICPF for India and presented in the next chapter seeks to utilize a combination of these strategies to generate 100 million new jobs within a decade or less, which will be sufficient to raise 25 per cent of the world’s poorest billion people above the poverty line.
 Given a comprehensive approach, the right mix of policies, good government and a conducive international environment for trade, technology transfer and investment, every nation has the capacity to develop and meet the employment needs of its people within the next one or two decades.
 The Right to Employment
 The transformation of social life in this century has drawn hundreds of millions of people away from a subsistence level existence in agriculture to urban areas and industrial employment.
 In the process it has brought about an unprecedented advancement in living standards around the world.
 But it has also engendered a way of life in which the livelihood of individuals is far more dependent than in the past on external conditions – the state of the national and global economy, trade policies, interest and exchange rates, levels of military spending and overall consumer demand.
 Modern society, even in the most liberal democracies, has become so structured that it leaves less and less freedom for truly independent individual initiative.
 Today, government intervenes in virtually every aspect of society’s economic existence, restricting the freedom of the individual to seek his or her own livelihood and determining the type and number of job opportunities available.
 Employment opportunities are directly linked to government tax policy concerning capital gains, depreciation, energy, wages and salaries, as well as by policies governing minimum wage laws, interest rates, budget deficits, imports and exports, environmental regulations and restrictions, defence spending, immigration, industrial development, investment, licensing of practitioners, zoning laws and countless other public policy issues.

If anyone knows where Oreintvenir is; it is Taiga” “My lovely Gracella, you are an Immortalist of impressive power and intellect.
 But we are Immortalist, time is on our side and Grand Master Oreintvenir has been gone for less than a year.
 It is not unusual for one of his power to be gone for such a length of time.
 He could be anywhere on this world or beyond it.
 There is no need to be in such a... rush to ask questions.” “Van’dret doesn’t play your word games with me, you know, and I know that this is not a normal disappearance.
 Not with one of the great cosmic alignments coming in such a short time.
 Neither of us would be surprised if Taiga had killed him and taken his place.
 But, then he would simply have called a concave and be elected Guild Master if that was the case.” “You’re not suggesting that Taiga is involved in some foul play against the Grand Master are you?” asked Van’dret his tone equally outraged and surprised.
 Gracella almost physically jumped at the suggestion and could not help herself from a quick glance around the hall before responding.
 “I don’t think Taiga has any interest in becoming Guild Master, or he would be Guild Master.

Jason turned in his sleep, mumbling something unintelligent.
 I needed to talk to someone, but everyone was sleeping.
 I pushed Seth over and his eyes flew open.
 His hand went to his sword but he saw me and he relaxed.
 “What was the point of pushing me over, Jazell?” “Well, it seemed better than punching you in the side.
 Were you dreaming?” I asked.
 He shook his head.
 “Just a bunch of nonsense I don't even remember.
 Why, did you get another vision?” “Yes,” I said.
 “It was with the same voice that was in my last dream.

She did so.
 "Oh!
 We're moving!"
 She tightened her grip on the steering wheel.
 "Relax.
 Just turn in the direction you want to go."
 For a few seconds they rolled forward, and then Rick saw her relax.
 "OK, press on the gas pedal.
 Just a little.
 Not--" he grunted--"like that."

Her arms and legs arched backward, her sword fell from her hand, and her mouth opened in a single, aching shriek.
 Bits of darkness flared from her mouth, her eyes, and her nostrils.
 Done, Velixar shoved her smoking body back into the alley and left her to die.
 When he turned, he snarled.
 Aurelia was gone.
 “You have delayed me my kill,” he said to Felewen’s body.
 “Pray you are dead before I return.”
 He placed his hood back over his head, pulled it down to cover his features, and then began his search for the sorceress.

Please, I beg of you, don’t…”
 “Enough,” Qurrah said.
 His hand reached out, the tips of his fingers brushing the sides of the man’s face.
 Haunting words of magic flowed from the necromancer’s mouth.
 The noble’s jaw dropped, and black veins appeared in his eyes.
 “By the gods, what is that?”
 Harruq followed the man’s upward gaze but saw only clear night sky.
 “Keep it away from me!” the man shouted as Qurrah released his hand and backed away.
 A glint of pleasure shone in his eyes as he watched his handiwork.
 The nobleman struggled against the ropes, his gaze locked on the sky.

One second Brandon was a human, the next he was a huge monstrosity, a thing that normally dwelt in the bottom, most primitive parts of the mind, venturing out only to star prominently in nightmares.
 The rush of power beat back at our entire pack.
 If it'd been a physical wind it would've knocked me over.
 Intangible or not, it still staggered me and only my grip on Jasmin and Dom kept me from dropping to my knees.
 Alec stood motionless for a pair of seconds, and then seemed to explode and melt back into himself.
 I blinked, and his human body had been replaced with the hybrid form that'd saved my life once before.
 Only this time he wasn't fighting wolves, he was fighting another hybrid, and Brandon towered over him.
 There was another ripple of movement on the other side of the light.
 Jasmin and Dom both pulled away from me, joining the other three, facing outward in preparation for the inevitable attack.
 Vincent's dark form inched slightly closer, but Brandon's growl froze his henchman in place.

The sky darkened even more, not that I thought that was possible.
 The mist swirled and a cold chill that ran shivers down my spine ascended on us.
 And out of the mist stepped a dark figure.
 Kojas.
 Again.
 This time for real.
 Not in a dream/vision.
 My heart stopped and my blood froze.
 Kojas’ red eyes gleamed in the darkness and his cloak snapped at the wind.
 He looked up and his red eyes stared at me.

He didn’t.
 Instead he crosscut, his left arm swiping right while the other swept left.
 She turned to one side, using her staff to press one sword into the dirt and knock the second swipe just above her.
 The staff continued twirling, positioning Harruq’s hands further out of place.
 She used the awkwardness to gain further separation between them.
 Her hands ached from the force of every block and parry.
 Her breath was fast and shallow.
 Her hair, which she had failed to tie up before the fight, hung in wild strands before her face.
 She was beautiful, but Harruq did not see it.
 To Harruq, she was the young girl cradling her sister.

I had made far more mistakes than my ego would allow me to acknowledge.
 I guess this was my bottom.
 Moving back to Sacramento would be the first time in many years I would live with my mom, who had recently become a widow.
 She needed my help sorting things out, because she was left with a lot of complex issues after Dino’s suspicious death.
 The story goes that Dino was at an associate’s home helping him cut some hedges.
 He cut into a bush that apparently had a yellow jacket nest in it and they swarmed him and stung him to death.
 Nobody else at the event was stung, but he was stung several hundred times.
 The venom in such a massive dose poisoned him, so the story goes.
 I do believe in Karma (well, I do now!)
 and the world is a better place without this man, but I don’t know if I believe that story.

“I have no strength left to open another portal.
 You, and he, will have to wait until I get some rest.”
 “How long will that be?”
 “Tomorrow morning,” she said.
 He raged and sputtered but could think of nothing to say or do.
 Finally, he started walking.
 “Where are you going?” she asked him.
 “To get my brother,” he said without turning around.
 “They will kill you,” she shouted.
 “They will see you and kill you.

But I would be lying if I claimed to feel all that about God.
 My problem invites the question: how can I adore God when I don’t quite know what to make of him?
 I hear and read that he’s a person, and a spirit, who resides everywhere, outside and in us.
 I understand that if my imagination is too small to fathom God as a whole, which of course it is, I can grasp who God is by observing the qualities, nature, and actions of Christ.
 But though I have read, listened, prayed, and pondered about Jesus for dozens of years, in all honesty, given my definition, I can't claim to adore him either.
 Maybe if he were a woman, I could at least come closer to adoration, as I find women easier to adore.
 Not just for the pretty faces or figures, but for their gentler natures.
 Aside from my father and son, I can’t think of a man I have adored except Eric Curtis.
 Love?
 The heart of the Shema, Deuteronomy 6:5, commands Israel to: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.” Jesus agrees, in Matthew 22: "’Teacher,’ a disciple asks,  ‘which is the greatest commandment in the Law?’ Jesus replies: 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.

“How did you escape?” Velixar asked.
 “Master exhausted himself defending his tower,” Qurrah said, waving a dismissive hand.
 “He collapsed at the very top.
 I cast a spell upon his throat, filling it with ice.
 I watched him die and then I left that disgusting place forever.”
 “You were a worthy apprentice,” Velixar said.
 “Especially to learn such a spell on your own.
 Your master was blind.”
 “He was weakened,” Qurrah said.
 “Even the clumsiest of fighters can slay a sleeping man.”

They weren't the obvious nasty looks that kids shoot each other of course.
 They were subtle and infrequent but there was something about the set of his mouth that made it clear he wasn't pleased I was in his class.
 I shrugged it all off and gutted my way through class, eagerly planning what I'd say to Alec when I saw him in physics, only when I finally stalked into Mrs. Alexander's class Alec wasn't sitting in his corner desk.
 I pulled out my notes and started reviewing what I'd managed to learn about our project, stalling until he arrived so I could give him a piece of my mind.
 Only he never walked through the door.
 I still had my anger, but it wasn't cushioning me as well for some reason.
 It felt like another attack was on the way.
 My pulse was skyrocketing and the room wavered as my vision dimmed.
 It didn't make sense to be having a panic attack right now, but images of Cindi swam into view, alternating with pictures of Alec and Rachel.
 It was like Alec's cruelty to his sister somehow meant I was failing Cindi.

Still, something had changed.
 I held onto that hope right up until I saw Mrs. Sorenson joining everyone else in staring at me whenever I looked down at my book.
 There was no mistaking the look on her face; it was utter distaste, possibly with a dash of disdain.
 I was so tired of it all.
 By the time English rolled around my natural embarrassment had given way to actual anger at Britney for starting it all.
 She tried to catch me at our lockers in between classes, but I pretended not to hear her, and made it safely into Mr. Whethers' class before she could catch up.
 Part of me acknowledged how petty it was, but I avoided her attempts at a whispered conversation during class.
 Mr. Whethers unknowingly helped my cause, when he crossly silenced a couple of girls on the far side of the classroom.
 He was normally so even-tempered that even his moderate rebuke instantly shut them up.
 I probably shouldn't have felt quite so happy about it, but I was pretty sure from the way they'd been looking at me that I'd been the source of their gossip.

“Aurry, are you there?” he shouted.
 He had hoped the elf would be waiting for him, but as he neared their usual clearing there was no sign of her.
 His heart skipped, and he feared she had already gone off to prepare for battle.
 “Aurelia, come on out now,” he shouted again.
 His eyes searched the forest.
 “I’m here,” Aurelia said.
 Her voice was quiet, subdued.
 Harruq turned and tried to smile.
 “There you are.
 Are you doing alright?”

I satisfied my ego by giving the cat pee-smelling elixir more credit than was probably due, but some part of me knew the training had not been hard because it was physical.
 It had been the use of magic.
 I put the new shirt on, made of soft black leather and corseted tight around my waist.
 Slim, dark wool pants and tall boots went on next and I wondered at the village we’d be entering where black was appropriate.
 I could think of no one at home who had worn black; I envisioned the dainty blond elves dancing around in dark leather and giggled.
 I glanced up to find Chevelle, wearing an unfathomable expression.
 I hurried to finish lacing the boots, throwing the cloak around my shoulders as he left more rations and went to ready the horses.
 I stretched out on the ground to eat, examining the carved medallion clasped to my boot.
 Chevelle stepped away again, disappearing behind the rocks that had become more jagged and taller along our way.
 When he returned, the sight of him stole my breath.

As a half Forest Nymph she seemed to be able to disappear into the forest.
 Rodregas quickly learned how she had been able to track him from Raven Keep.
 While she claimed that other Forest Nymphs had far better skills, Rodregas had never seen anyone to match her abilities.
 They had taken the three horses back up the trail where any sounds they made would not be heard from the road.
 Then Doi’van and Rodregas had found some cover that still gave a good view of the road.
 They sat on the ground and waited until Imeralda signaled that something was coming.
 Rodregas neither heard nor saw any activity and his physical senses were far more accurate than when he had been a young man.
 His guess was that her connection with the forest had somehow warned her that something was coming.
 Doi’van and Rodregas looked at each other as they squatted down in the shrubs.
 Doi’van had one of the Black Yew bows out, with arrows at hand, if needed.

He approved of Alec's father's choice even back when most of the pack was still energetically opposed to the idea.
 He's always been one to see truly."
 "You are, I mean, you were close?"
 Her smile turned sad.
 "Actually, neither.
 We weren't close when there was an opportunity for closeness, and now that I'd like very few things more than to be close to him, there's no real opportunity for us to become so."
 She patted my hand as she shrugged.
 "It's rather ironic how things work out sometimes, but that's not fair on my part.
 I'm sure there are things you would much rather learn of than how I came to be in my present circumstances."
 "Actually, that's part of what I want to understand.

 I’ll do what I can.

 Art – Nothing of the sort, these are pretty simple.

“Just what kind of Paladin would you be?” Imeralda asked him.
 “Why, it should be obvious to you more than anyone,” Rodregas said with a slight bow to the beautiful half AElf.
 “The kind of heroic Paladin that rescues beautiful maidens in distress and frees’ innocent prisoners from the dungeons of evil sorcerers.” Rodregas could not help but smile at his own line.
 He had always found that a good joke was like a good insult; the best always had enough truth in them to sting.
 Geor smiled, but the others seemed not to have appreciated his little joke.
 The AElf maiden just looked at Rodregas quietly and thoughtfully.
 The Hellborn Orqui smiled, but with a look that said he did it because the other men smiled.
 Rodregas had a feeling that Doi’van lacked much of a sense of humor.
 The other three men simply shook their heads at his idiotic statement.
 Not that his statement did not have a hint of truth to it.

A radical change in values, priorities and policies at countless points is required.
 It can only be done by the conscious initiative of government compelled by the expectations and demands of an electorate educated to understand the impact of government on economic life and the scope for increasing employment opportunities in a market economy.
 If society decides that useful jobs must be created, then they will be created.
 Full employment can be achieved by any country that has the will and determination to achieve it.
 This does not mean that every country can accomplish the goal immediately.
 Nor does it mean that governments should try to spend their way out of unemployment by creating artificial jobs for all who seek them.
 But the high current costs of the unemployed certainly suggest that there are more constructive ways to spend available resources to solve the problem.
 Instead, a commitment to self-employment should lead the government to reexamine and where necessary alter the nature of its priorities and policies and the structure of its economic system in order to make achievement of this goal possible.
 The magnitude of the task and the prescription may vary, but the goal and determination can be shared by all.

 “Monster!” I cried.

 I looked up the hill to see a bunch of faery jerks running down the hill towards us.
 Emily stood in front of Jason and raised her hands.
 I notched an arrow and aimed.
 Dust kicked up everywhere as I aimed blindly.

 She headed for the door.

 Buddy got his first musicmaker, a ukulele, when he was a sapling, six years old, a first-grader at Idlewild Elementary.
 He hung onto that uke as if it was his lifeline, time and time again having it taken from him on the playground where he would serenade a few curious classmates with his bewailing renditions of old Hank Williams songs.
 The end of most schooldays found little Buddy in the principal’s office explaining why he should get his instrument back and vowing never to bring it again.

Anvil bent down to keep his stare close, threatening, and the broken man looked at me.
 His glare turned accusing, his mouth suddenly moving with heated, determined words, but my ears only rang louder, engulfing all other sound.
 I cringed, but couldn’t stop myself from watching the scene play out, even as my head turned down, wanting to look away.
 Why is he fixed on me?
 What are they saying?
 Ruby remained protectively in front of me, her posture lowered, arms tensed tighter since the stranger turned his eyes on me.
 His face twisted in agony as his right arm was dislocated from its socket, leaving the limb hanging limply at the shoulder.
 I was glad I didn’t hear that sound.
 He turned back to his questioner, his mouth a grimace as the words came out, unmistakably a curse, and his other arm was wrenched from its place as well.
 He winced, apparently not yet numb from the damages, and then his face went hard, his lips pressed together, jaw clenched tight.

I will be honest Rodregas, I am not sure that this will work.
 These warriors are trained in the use of the lance and their war horses will negate your personal advantage in physical might, as your horse is a trail mount.” Doi’van paused and said, “But, the real problem is that you are without plate armor.
 I am not sure how you can survive such a competition.
 The competition with mace or hammer will be only marginally better for you.
 Your body is far stronger than theirs, but not as strong as Night Bronze or Mithril.” Doi’van shook his head.
 “I don’t know how you can compete with simple steel!” “Rodregas,” Doi’van said, “I think you should give up on this task, the Cathedral is busy; and none will know if we simply leave.” Imeralda nodded, but something about the way she stood told Rodregas that she knew he would not do this.
 “So have you done the math?” Rodregas asked.
 “What if I get five points on the hand-to-hand and five with the sword and shield and maybe two with the bow?
 Would twelve points get me to the final?” “Unlikely,” answered Doi’van.
 “I have asked around and fifteen seems to be the magic number.

Jess had opted for a sleeveless silver number that flared out at the bottom so much I wasn't sure how Isaac would be able to walk next to her without stepping on the shimmery material.
 Rachel's mauve dress was probably the most conservative of all, neither over-snug, nor especially low-cut.
 It had seemed entirely out of character considering what she'd purchased for the rest of us, but when I'd asked, she'd just grimaced and said Alec would've made her stay home if she'd chosen anything more daring.
 None of which helped me feel any more comfortable in the tight, strapless wonder Rachel had been so excited to give me.
 Even with all of the weight I'd lost since the accident, it still felt like the material was fighting a losing battle to stretch itself over my frame.
 I'd been hoping to be able to put off actually putting the dress on for at least another half hour, but when my makeup had finally been pronounced satisfactory, Jasmin had studied me for a few minutes, pulled my hair back, secured it with a pair of silver combs I was worried might actually contain genuine diamonds, and then helped Rachel cram me into the dress.
 If Jessica hadn't grudgingly complimented me on just how good my hair looked, I might have suspected Jasmin was trying to purposefully make me look worse than the other girls.
 Dominic and Rachel had to tell me I looked good, that was an unwritten girl-rule regardless of what species you were.
 Jessica had no such imperative, so I was forced to conclude Jasmin had done the best she could considering what she had to work with, and resigned myself to being the homely one in the group.
 Still, seeing all of the other girls in one place, fully decked out in the kind of shoes I'd always wanted to wear, but never been able to pull off, was even more intimidating.

I didn't realize you even had anyone working today."
 Mom listened for several more seconds and then hung up.
 "They just sent the money.
 Apparently it's for real.
 The bank president was just calling to tell me the money has been confirmed, subject to my accepting the job."
 Now was the time to strike.
 "Mom, go call Mr. Peters, and I'll start pulling your stuff together."
 It's amazing how quickly you can pack when it's for someone else, and they aren't around to tell you what you can or can't throw into their suitcase.
 Even with my lack of sleep starting to catch up with me, I was still essentially done by the time Mom wandered into her room, staring at her phone like she wasn't sure it was really possible for it to have just told her what she'd just heard.
 "He says it's fine.

Please.
 Sit down and let's talk about this."
 Her body still throbbing with the pulse he'd made race, she perched on the edge of the sofa.
 "I didn't want you to stop."
 "And I didn't want to stop.
 But sweetheart .

 He sighed, rubbing his forehead.

Our limo pulls up followed by a stream of limos and cars.
 A large tent is up over the gravesite and rows of chairs for the service.
 The massive flower arrangements, which have somehow followed us from every location, are front and center next to a podium where people will once again speak to what a wonderful father, son, brother, (criminal), blah blah blah Dino was.
 Everyone is seated and the service is ready to begin.
 Once the sermon begins, though, guess what is back?
 Yep, we can hear the helicopter, but we can’t see it through trees and tent.
 The noise gets louder and louder and it suddenly drops down behind the podium.
 The wind from the swirling blades intensifies and the flower displays that sit on tripods start to fall forward and the tent begins to rattle and shake, the wind starts to uproot the tent from the stakes which anchor it.
 The helicopter is facing us and begins to slowly maneuver to expose its side.
 The tent is ripped from the ground and tumbles away leaving a clear view of the black helicopter that is lowering itself closer to the ground.

What did she say?” “She hinted that she knew who made us this way and who attacked us that day,” I said.
 “She also said that Kojas would use our emotions against us and try to get us to come to him.” Something dark crossed Seth's face.
 “She also said that we were chosen because of our strong bond, but she said, not to test it,” I continued.
 “She also told me not to go into the shadows.” Seth stretched.
 “So the usual confusion?” “I got more this time, Seth.
 Anyway, do you have any information to offer here?” I asked with an edge to my voice.
 Seth put his arms in surrender.
 “Hey, don't start yelling at me.
 We were getting a long pretty well last night, let's keep it that way.” I felt my face flush when I remembered last night.
 “Yes, you're right.” I was eager to change the subject so I said, “Are you going to tell them when they wake up?” “Yes I will, Jazell.

I saw Seth slow his bike down and glide next to me.
 “Hey,” he said.
 “Hey.” Then a question popped into my head, “What were you doing alone in the woods yesterday?” He was silent so I yelled to Emily, “Hey, Seth’s lost for words!” Emily appeared by me and chuckled.
 “What’s wrong, Seth?
 Thrasher got your tongue?” Before he could reply I said, “I asked him what he was doing in the woods yesterday and he didn’t have an answer.
 We all know what this means.” “Yup, he’s hiding something.
 Seth, why were you yelling at Jazell for being out alone in the woods when you were doing the same?” “I wasn’t hunting down monsters alone.
 Jazell was doing that,” he grumbled, clearly annoyed.
 “But you were still out alone and you yelled at me for doing the same thing.
 The same thing could have happened to you.

“Don’t fret.
 She’s actually very talented.” His smile warmed.
 “An asset, you’ll see.” An asset?
 Ruby came through the door, in a movement that could nearly have been classified as whirling.
 “Come on, Steed.
 We need to set you up outside of town.
 Chevelle is afraid we’re causing a scene in the village.” She laughed lightly.
 It seemed like she was having fun.
 I wondered if that meant she was causing trouble.
 “Don’t think he trusts you with the girl,” Ruby added, smiling playfully.

"It's getting late.
 We need to get home."
 He helped her into the car.
 "I think I like 1927 cars better than 2011 cars," Marie said as Rick slid behind the wheel.
 "Why?"
 "I could sit right beside you in a 1927 car."
 "You have a good point."
 As soon as he'd pulled out of the driveway, he took her hand.
 "Did you have a good time tonight?"
 "Mmm."

Even here it is likely to come primarily from entrenched vested interests, not the general public.
 A mere tinkering with or modest amendment to the structure of the UN will only perpetuate the inherent inadequacies of the present system and postpone its maturation into a truly effective instrument for global political, economic and social integration and collective accomplishment.
 Many proposals are being floated to modify its workings, mostly by expanding representation on the Security Council.
 As an interim measure and first steps, the immediate addition of five more permanent members to the Security Council, based on the criteria of population and economic status, and the abolition of the veto power are fully justified.
 However, these changes do not go far enough in furthering the interests of global peace and development.
 They will not fundamentally alter the out-dated, non-representative structure which perpetuates the status quo.
 It is time to devise a new formula and a new structure for international governance that will reconcile and harmonize the political rights and economic interests of all the world’s peoples.
 The institution that had come to symbolize the Cold War must be restructured in such a manner as to symbolize the abolition of all war and the establishment of peace and democracy as the foundations for global development.
 Global Social Revolution
 A second revolution also possesses tremendous transforming power to accelerate human progress – the revolution of rising expectations.

Glancing at him, she turned and headed downstairs.
 Rick followed her, wondering if she was mad or embarrassed or confused.
 Most women would never again speak to a man who had rejected her touch.
 But most women would have known exactly what they were doing.
 Marie had simply been yielding to the pleasure of his kisses and touches with no intention of giving up her virginity.
 He'd never known a woman so passionate.
 When they walked out into the garden, Marie headed for the fog without a backward glance.
 Rick grabbed her hand.
 "Marie, wait."
 He pulled her close, gazing down at her.

And my father is wealthy.
 We have enough money to do anything we want.
 But all he wants to do is earn more money.
 When I was 19, we went to a new resort in Palm Beach.
 For months I looked forward to it, but it was a terrible disappointment.
 Father went only because a man with whom he had business was going there for the Christmas holidays.
 And he wouldn't allow me out.
 He's very protective."
 "And you didn't sneak out?"
 Rick asked with exaggerated astonishment.

Just as Sonowin pulled higher and higher into the air, outracing more than seven growing hands reaching up for them, the elf spotted two lone figures amid the sea of dead.
 “Sonowin,” he shouted to his steed.
 “There, you must get to them!”
 The horse snorted, banked around, and dove straight for the approaching hands.
 A quick spiral avoided the first wave.
 Dieredon clutched his bow and held on for dear life, his eyes locking on the man in black who stood perfectly still, his arms at downward angles from his body.
 The rest of the elves were in full retreat.
 He was the only one left.
 Qurrah watched Dieredon’s approach with a gnawing fear in his chest.
 It seemed no hand could touch this one, the horse possessing dexterity beyond what any creature that size should have.

Prosperity, which eliminates hunger, also tends to eliminate violence.
 Even in war-ravaged Africa, experience shows that where food is plentiful, war is avoided.
 The converse is also true.
 Historically, war and civil strife have been the single greatest cause of famines.
 In addition to destroying crops and food supplies, it disrupts food distribution through the use of sieges and blockades.
 In the past decade, war has had a greater impact on food supplies in Africa, particularly the Sahelian region, than have the severe droughts that periodically plague the continent.
 Freedom from hunger and political freedom go hand in hand.
 As subsistence agriculture and periodic famine were the economic foundations of monarchy and feudalism, the generation of agricultural surpluses that stimulated commercialism, and later industrialization, have formed the basis for the rise of democratic institutions.
 Greater freedom for individual action and ownership both stimulate and are supported by greater productivity in agriculture.
 Authoritarian government is frequently either the result or the cause of food shortages – its use of force justified on the one hand to meet a crisis situation or necessitated on the other to restore order and initiate emergency measures.

"What?"
 he asked, bending his head closer to hers.
 "Stop being so nice to me!"
 He frowned.
 "You don't want me to be nice to you?"
 "No."
 She sat up and held out her hand for his handkerchief.
 He gave it to her.
 "Why?"
 "It confuses me."

The half-orc ran as people flooded the streets, calling out for buckets and water.
 Too many homes were aflame.
 They could no longer cower within them and hope to be spared.
 In the commotion, Qurrah vanished, unseen and uncared for.
 He had spent his whole life disappearing in crowds, and in the dark of night, surrounded by fear and worry, he was just a shadow.
 !
 [section break](break.png)
 Qurrah was in no hurry as he left the city behind.
 The grass was soft and tall, and it felt good under his feet after so much sprinting down stone roads.
 Stars filled the sky, and he smiled to them often.

 Oh, how I miss him."
 Alec let his mother take both of his hands in hers.
 "I know you do, Mother.
 Rachel and I miss him too."

The sword gleamed of the highest quality blue steel and red fire seemed to run its length.
 Marshal Faurrenida laid the sword on Rodregas’ right shoulder and said, “Squire, you come to us this day.
 Think well and be sure on your decision to swear these oaths.” Faurrenida paused for a second and then slowly added.
 “Will you swear to uphold the Rules of Chivalry, to serve the Order of the Soaring Heavens with honor, and to serve as the Champion of the Celestials on this World if called to be a Paladin?” “My Lord Grand Marshal, I so swear in the name of the Celestial Gods.” Strangely, instead of being excited, he felt tired.
 In some ways he was adding another burden and it was heavy.
 “Arise, Sir Rodregas, Knight of the Soaring Heavens and be made welcome in the Cathedral of the Heavens.” Applause filled the room, though it was muted.
 Rodregas looked for Doi’van and Imeralda and he was sad to see that they had not been there to share his moment.
 Van’dret at least had left.
 The next few hours went by quickly.
 He was introduced to many people.

 “Alvrik,” Harruq muttered as he approached the giant double doors leading into the castle, which were flanked on each side by two soldiers.
 “Avrik?
 Alrik?
 Avlerik?
 How the bloody abyss did he say his name?”
 He stopped when he realized the soldiers were staring at him with none-too- happy looks on their faces.

She had no intention of breaking up with her boyfriend.
 I looked her square in her beautiful blue eyes and I told her flatly, “You are going to fall so in love with me that you will not even remember this guy’s name!” We were married three years later.
 After all the years we have been married, I still think of that moment I saw her walk into that bar whenever we are having a tough time.
 It puts all my love right back where it belongs and nothing else matters.
 Chapter 11: The Prescription Startled, I scan across the windshield and fumble for the ringing phone.
 It is Ashley and Steve, the drug dealers.
 Ashley says they are on their way.
 She tells me how they are having some difficulty raising the cash and are trying to work it out.
 Ashley takes my temperature on fronting her some of the drugs if they can’t get all the cash, and I can hear Steve coaching her in the background.
 I tell her this is unacceptable.

It was woodsy and cool and we shared a two-bedroom unit with a common kitchen and a family room with a fireplace.
 It wasn’t much but it was everything to my wife and me.
 We took long walks as a family and we talked like we hadn’t in years, or possibly ever.
 We sat by the fireplace and cooked meals together in this tiny motel kitchen.
 We hiked one day through the forest and climbed a small mountain where we stood together and looked out at the beauty of the nature that surrounded us.
 When your children are young you have many special moments and they pass by so fast because they are so frequent.
 People always warn you how fast your children will grow and one day it happens and you realize that you were warned.
 When your children get old enough to move out of your home, you have very few opportunities to have special family moments and that makes them even more wonderful.
 We returned to our home after the trip and we went to bed late that night.
 I woke that morning before my wife and my sons.

The world kind of becomes your oyster when you've got your own jet.
 The last thing I'd expected was a picnic up at the top of the mountain that cradled the Graves' estate between large, rocky spurs.
 It was perfect.
 For Alec money was nothing more than a useful tool, but he understood I still wasn't comfortable having that tool used to purchase me things I didn't really need.
 I'd set out determined to hike the whole way up to the top, but I was still a little weak.
 Apparently everyone had been right about just how much blood I'd lost the night our pack had destroyed the local rival pack.
 They'd been trying to absorb Alec's pack for the last several years and he hadn't really had any other options, but I knew he still felt uneasy about what had happened.
 With his superhuman hearing and sense of smell, Alec knew I was struggling before I even did.
 He waited though until I finally admitted how tired I was, and then he scooped me up and effortlessly jogged to the top of the peak.

 Ruby laughed and it made my hair stand on end.

 She shifted and the markings on her leg caught my attention.
 A thin painted vine trailed up to her thigh.
 She noticed me looking.
 “Well, Frey, I feel like I know so much about you.” She smiled slyly at Chevelle.

Rodregas was unsure which reaction was proper now, and which she would want him to feel.
 Doi’van had watched the whole show with the thoughtful expression that he was starting to believe was his normal face to the world.
 “And do you have a full suit of Night Bronze Plate Mail for me and a magic sword or three as well?” he asked in his careful voice.
 “I am afraid that if we want any proper armor for ourselves we are going to have to take it off some Immortal Guard’s corpse.
 But I do have one other Black Yew bow and a bigger sword that probably makes more sense for you to use than me, since I have used nothing but short swords for a very long time.” Rodregas then pulled out the two-handed great sword that he had found at the keep and handed it to Doi’van.
 On Doi’van it was more a hand and a half sword, but as he flourished it around a bit, Rodregas could see he was pleased.
 “The steel is simple, but the balance is good.
 I am starting to be very happy that I helped pull this wagon up the hill,” he said with a deep chuckle, which sounded like distant thunder.
 Rodregas nodded and said, “I am afraid other than a few items to sell everything else is food and blankets for us... and the horses and tools that I stripped out of the Raven Keep.
 I figured I would need the tools to fix this place up and make it livable.” Rodregas continued, “It is dark and late.

I'm sorry I can't come over and talk.
 They all really depend on me.
 This whole thing with Jasmin is really crazy; we've got to figure out how best to handle it.
 Maybe it really said all of those things, or maybe I was completely deluded, but it was definitely a smile.
 That alone was enough to make my heart skip a beat, and send a warm tingly feeling lapping through me like a wave of distilled happiness.
 I was halfway through History before I realized there'd been something odd about the discussion at Brandon's table.
 Luckily, Mr. Simms started out the class in usual form.
 It was virtually guaranteed we wouldn't learn anything which was fortunate or I might have missed something.
 Once my mind latched on the question of what had been different than normal, I didn't hear a word anyone else said.
 It wasn't until I was back at my locker and midway between switching out my History book for my Physics notes that I finally realized what it was.

Then I got up, swallowed a few aspirin, and roused Eric to tell him about my adventure.
 “I was on one side of a bottomless gorge, looking across at this forest of evergreens and fruit trees, with all the colors so bright they looked lighted from inside.
 The forest was on an endless slope.
 There wasn’t any horizon.
 And the music, each note contained all kinds of harmonies, all at once.
 And the instruments sounded like giant bells, big as mountains, far away.” Eric had sat up.
 His eyes bored into mine.
 “Were you scared?
 What’s it feel like there?” “You know when you’re away from home and no matter how great a time you’re having, you’re still a bit uneasy, so when you get home you always feel relieved?
 You unwind, your heart slows.

He lifted his hands, which shone a pallid white in the fading moonlight.
 So very slowly their color faded, from white, to gray, to nothing, a darkness surrounding and hiding them.
 “What’s going on?” Harruq asked.
 He pulled one of his swords out from its sheath, pleased by the feeling of confidence it gave him.
 Qurrah said not a word.
 His eyes were far away, and his lips moved but produced no sound.
 “Qurrah?” Harruq asked again.
 “Qurrah!”
 He struck his brother on the arm.
 Qurrah jolted as if suddenly waking.

Take a shower, change into some of your own clothes, and then go to sleep.
 We'll keep watch outside until your mom gets back."
 I opened my mouth to ask what would happen after that, but he was already gone, moving so quickly through the darkness that I wasn't even sure which direction he'd headed.
 I locked the door for the first time since we'd arrived in Sanctuary, turned on all the downstairs lights, and then slowly walked upstairs.
 It was crazy to be scared that Alec had somehow missed someone, but I couldn't shake the feeling I was being watched.
 Once I finally made it upstairs, I checked both rooms, and the bathroom, before finally relaxing a little.
 I showered quickly, carefully making sure the smell of alcohol and cigarette smoke was out of my hair, and then changed into clean clothes and collapsed onto my bed.
 I was exhausted, but I couldn't fall asleep.
 Every time I closed my eyes, I saw dark shapes hurtling towards me.
 After looking at the clock for the thousandth time, I finally got up and went downstairs.

No doubt she recognized how liars teach us not to trust.
 I believe it was Sylvia Curtis, when Eric and I talked to her about Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, who convinced me that Holden Caulfield was right to pour most of his wrath on phonies.
 When Olga Savitsky and I considered founding a church, we agreed that above the entrance would hang a sign, “No bullshit allowed.” After all, God is a matter of life and death.
 In Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Robert Pirsig argues that being stuck is the best place for a mechanic (or a problem solver of any sort) to find himself.
 When we’re stuck, we come to the problem free from any preconceptions.
 I mean to test his argument, because I’m stuck on the word “adore.” Here’s how it happened: in the midst of a period of personal, family, and professional turmoil, I picked up The Practice of the Presence of God, by Brother Lawrence, and discovered that simply reading about this fellow from long ago delivers some peace.
 Not perfect peace, but closer than before.
 Close enough so that friends find my apparent serenity in the midst of turmoil worth remarking about.
 Brother Lawrence was a layman who lived and worked, mostly in the kitchen, at a monastery in sixteenth century France.
 I thank God for the book by and about him.

She wore purple high waist pants and a cream colored blouse that went all the way to her neckline with ruffled edges framing her stunning face.
 Her long blond hair flowed down to her shoulders.
 If I could put a caption over her head, it would have read, “If you talk to me, I will kill you.” She looked completely out of place, and her blue eyes lit up the room.
 Her silent stare suggested that she was not there to be picked up or even approached.
 She was not the typical girl entering an 80’s bar and dance club.
 My mouth must have dropped open as I watched her every move; she appeared to be looking for someone in particular.
 I looked at my friend Bill and I swear I said to him: “I am going to marry that girl!” We hadn’t been there long, and I wasn’t drunk or impaired in any way, I just remember she seemed to be literally glowing, and I knew.
 I had never felt this before and I have never felt it since.
 Bill jokingly picked up a coin from the change on the bar and said “I’ll flip you for her” to which I replied, “Flip all you want, that is going to be my wife!” Bill flipped the coin anyway and I called “tails,” and tails it was.
 I had no choice but to muster the courage to talk to her.

Especially considering the way Alec had looked at me there at the end.
 Despite my best efforts the question still slipped out.
 "They're together then?"
 Britney smirked.
 "You really are masochistic, aren't you?
 That's the rumor.
 Nobody really seems to know, at least nobody who's talking, but they're almost always together.
 You really shouldn't go there; he's brutal when it comes to breaking girls' hearts."
 There was a story there, but I wasn't about to ask now and expose myself to further ridicule.
 Britney was oddly quiet as we entered the lunch room.

The guards will be mostly badly trained human scum armed in leather and with weapons of simple steel.
 The Immortalist scouts are another matter.
 They will be highly trained but still the lowest of the Immortal Guards, mostly with just one or two of the lesser sigils such as strength or one that gives him enhanced senses.
 Against the three of us, a Forest Nymph with a powerful Black Yew bow and a Hellborn Prince of the Orqui and a warrior empowered with a Celestial Lion, are the odds truly that bad?” Rodregas stood still, surprised by Doi’van’s words.
 In truth he did not know how good or bad their odds were.
 He knew they were not good, but his mind did not spin with the odds.
 He simply focused on the rightness of Doi’van’s words.
 Trying to attack an armed keep probably had far worse odds, and for what?
 So that they could steal horses; so that they could better their odds to escape a future fight?
 Here, if they succeeded, the three would not be stealing horses, they would be freeing people from slavery.

Clearly Imeralda would have the power to sense the stream of magic, but Doi’van had seemed equally effected.
 She turned to Rodregas; her eyebrows arched high in surprise and said, “A ley line and powerful?
 I knew there were several going through the Aridas, but your little abandoned farm is next to a ley line?” she asked.
 “Actually,” Rodregas said, “it is right in the middle of it, and there is even a small undercurrent suggesting that another weaker one crosses at the farm point.” Rodregas explained, “I had been on the run when we found this place.
 I had been worried that those tracking me were using magic.
 So to keep them off my track I traveled in and out of ley lines to throw off the magic scent.
 This one runs underground before coming out in this small valley.
 I was trying to find the ley line again.
 That is how I found the old farmhouse.” Ley lines are like rivers of magic energy that encircle the world.
 Most major Immortalist keeps and other magic locations are located either on one, or where two of them cross.

Art – Humans don’t need than faith.
 Faith is just a crutch to lean upon.
 A way to convince yourself that there is some reason for all the pain and humiliation.
 Rather than grasping reality and actually doing something to help the world, people with faith just wait for luck to see them through.
 Ned – What is it we need then?
 Art – All people need is love and happiness.
 That’s it.
 Some happiness you can find on your own, without love.
 Some of the best kind of happiness comes from love.
 Not the distant love of a remote God, but a personal love.

She looked up to see if she was close to Rick's house.
 It wasn't the house just ahead to the right, or the one beyond that.
 Had she come over that hill?
 Surely she couldn't have come very far.
 Panicking, she began to run.
 A woman was coming out of one house, wearing very short blue trousers, and Marie ran in the other direction.
 She had to find Rick's house!
 Being stuck in the future was bad enough, but if she couldn't find Rick again, she'd-- "Marie!"
 She turned toward his voice.
 "Rick?"

I am indebted to Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary General of the United Nations; Dr Federico Mayor, Director General of UNESCO; and Mr James Gustave Speth, Administrator of UNDP, for their support and encouragement.
 A special word of thanks is also due to Mrs Robin La Brie-Jackson, who has helped throughout in managing the work of the Commission with great competence and courtesy.
 Finally, I must acknowledge the inspiration and encouragement provided by Mr T. Natarajan, Secretary, The Mother's Service Society, Pondicherry, India, from the very inception of the idea of the Commission.
 His emphasis on leadership in thought that leads to action has served as a guiding principle for the work of the Commission.
 A more complete list of the many individuals and institutions who have contributed generously of their time and resources to our work is contained in the Acknowledgements appended to this volume.
 During 1994 and 1995, several major international events will take place.
 The International Conference on Population and Development at Cairo in September 1994, the World Summit for Social Development at Copenhagen and the Fourth World Conference on Women at Beijing in 1995, and the designation of 1995 as the International Year for Tolerance all provide unique opportunities for promoting sustainable and equitable development.
 The past 50 years since the birth of the UN have marked striking progress in every field of human endeavour, except in the areas of ecological and human security.
 We should now concentrate on these aspects of security, so vital for sustained human happiness and fulfilment.
 It is our hope that this report will be of some help in accelerating the pace of progress in the evolution of a new human ethic conducive to human beings living in harmony with nature and with each other.

Qurrah nodded, his thoughts distant.
 “They’re ready for us.
 Many elves will be lurking inside the woods as they hunt for the Forest Butcher.” Again Qurrah chuckled at the name his brother had earned.
 “Will we stop for a while?” Harruq asked.
 The smaller half-orc shook his head.
 “Of course not.
 I must keep learning, increasing my strength.
 We will resume, just this time amid the darkness.”
 Harruq nodded, obviously uneasy.
 “Hey brother?”

I watched Seth pace back and forth, nervously running his fingers through his hair and drumming the hilt of his sword.
 I can also tell you to be careful about Kojas; he's tricky and will use your emotions against you.
 He'll find a way to get you to come to him instead of him coming to you.
 The girl had told us more than we had thought.
 Maybe Kojas thought we would both imagine that he did something to the other two so that we would come running to him.
 I had a feeling that Emily and Jason were okay and just as confused as us.
 That also meant that Kojas knew as much, and maybe more than us.
 *** Emily pushed herself into sitting position, ignoring the sharp pains in her elbows and knees.
 Jason was leaning against a tree nearby, tossing a knife from hand to hand.
 She saw a deep, red scratch on his left cheek and the way he winced every time he moved his right arm, she could tell she must have injured it.

Velixar waved a hand.
 The dwindling fire between them swelled to a healthy blaze.
 “The two brothers were arrogant to think they could create a paradise with a creature so full of faults as man,” Velixar continued.
 “I saw the battle waged in the small town of Haven, there in the center of the delta.
 It is an awesome thing to watch gods duel.
 Ashhur fled before either could strike a killing blow.
 I summoned our armies, as did the priests of Ashhur.
 Think now of the many deformed creatures that walk this world.
 Know they were all mere animals before the gods turned them into soldiers for their war.
 The elves were vicious in this time, slaying any who dared come near their forests.

He won't ever let you have one."
 She wiped away a pair of tears before they could escape from the corner of her eyes.
 "You don't know what you're talking about, Adri.
 You really can't trust Brandon.
 He's not safe."
 "Whatever.
 Like your brother is any better."
 I turned and went out through the exterior door.
 I was all the way out to the parking lot before I realized that I didn't have a way home.
 I was still trying to figure out what to do, when I heard the deep roar of a high-performance engine.

Doi’van and Rodregas had to manhandle the wagon around a few corners which was easier to do than it should have been, but Celestial and Hellborn strength together made short work of it.
 Then, as they finally started to level out into the small little valley of the hollow, the hair all over Rodregas’ body suddenly stood up on end and his skin shivered.
 Rodregas was expecting it, but was a little shocked by the strength of his reaction.
 All those years ago he had had to struggle to feel it.
 Now he almost swayed in the currents of the magic stream of energy.
 The wagon halted as Doi’van stopped pushing it up the incline.
 He just stood there, his wild black unkempt hair seeming to blow in an invisible wind.
 Imeralda looked equally surprised and caught up.
 That was interesting.
 Clearly Imeralda would have the power to sense the stream of magic, but Doi’van had seemed equally effected.

My head started spinning almost instantly, only my hand on his chest, and his arms around my waist kept me from losing my balance completely.
 As it was, I still fell into him, overcome by weakness as my heart stopped beating altogether.
 No more than a second or two of breathlessness could have possibly passed, but Alec pulled away, firmly holding me at arm's length.
 "You need to get some sleep.
 Regardless of how the fight turns out, you'll need to be well-rested."
 My best longing look didn't seem to be having any effect on him, so I finally nodded and relaxed back onto the bed.
 "I guess I did promise to behave myself.
 I don't think I'll be able to sleep, but if you'll tell me another story I'll at least try..." Apparently satisfied by my promise, Alec joined me on the bed and pulled me close.
 I was still chilled enough from being outside for the warmth of his arms to feel good.
 "Adjam and Inock found that the dayborn had lost all knowledge of their loving mother, and that they reacted poorly to Inock's plague form.

To her delight, she saw that he was going to kiss her.
 She closed her eyes, savoring the anticipation and then the sweetness of his lips on hers.
 When, after a few seconds, he didn't end the kiss, her heartbeat sped up.
 He'd never kissed her this long before.
 But her eyes flew open when she felt his hand slide under her skirt to squeeze her thigh.
 Panicking, she tried to push him away.
 But he pinned her against the back of the sofa, his mouth becoming rough.
 She tried to break away from him because he was kissing her so hard that her teeth were cutting into her lips; she could taste the blood.
 But he wouldn't let her go.
 And then he pushed his tongue into her mouth, and shock and disgust fused with the pain to give her the strength to shove him away.

I couldn’t really remember anything from before the village.
 Anything except the dreams.
 “And I’m sure you want to be unbound?” Why is that a question?
 “Of course.” He nodded as if he were going down a checklist.
 “We know council has bound you.” I waited for the next detail, my fingers curling into my palms.
 “And we know they must be the one or ones to unbind you.” Some part of me realized the seriousness of the conversation, but all I could do was listen.
 “They are, obviously… unwilling.” The breath I drew was too sharp.
 “I know some about the binding.
 I’ve studied it.” When he stopped, I said, “All right.” I didn’t know what he was getting at.
 “The problem is… meddling with the bindings, meddling with your mind is… well, it’s dangerous.” And there it was.

A slightly tilted eyebrow seemed to ask Rachel if she wanted to come inside, but she shook her head, now with the slightest of quivers to her chin.
 Whatever I was expecting from Alec and Rachel's reactions, I didn't get it.
 The airy, sunlit room we walked into was almost like being outside.
 There were a number of plants scattered about the space, some resting on the floor, others on a variety of slender stands.
 The effect was ethereal.
 It was hard to imagine that any of the spun-metal stands could support anything more substantial than a box of Kleenex.
 It wasn't until we were further inside that I realized there was an entire alcove off to one side, almost completely dominated by a black grand piano.
 The piano was so breathtaking it was several seconds before I realized there was someone sitting at it.
 "Alec.
 I'm so glad you're safe.

"You need to see the nurse."
 My mind hiccupped for a second.
 There should be some kind of law requiring him to hide those things.
 Sunglasses, or maybe a blindfold.
 "I'm fine.
 That wasn't anything; it didn't mean anything.
 Please put me down."
 I tried to put the right amounts of sincerity and confidence in my words, but I wasn't a very good liar.
 Something changed though because Alec slowed his ground-eating stride.

When she returned, he took the aspirin and drank the juice, obeying when she insisted that he lie down on the sofa so that she could bathe his face with cool water.
 Marie patted his forehead with the washcloth, dipped it into the bowl of water, wrung it out, and then patted his forehead again.
 "Maybe a good night's sleep will help ward off a cold."
 She kissed his temple.
 He took her hand, pressing his lips into her palm.
 "Lie down here with me."
 She stretched out beside him, and finally, with Marie in his arms, he fell asleep.
 But when he awoke the next morning, she wasn't there.
 Panicking, he jumped up.

 But she also loved Rick.

Nobody in the family would let him live it down.
 We teased him all the time about it.
 Art – Has he shot himself yet?
 Or someone else?
 Karen – Not yet.
 Actually last I heard he was married again and they have two kids.
 Art – Well he seems to have bounced back from all the pain and humiliation, he must be a resilient young man.
 Karen – Well, he did leave the home first.
 He had to get away from not only the family, but the community.
 He comes from a small town, and everyone knew what happened.

Mixing more than casually with Nymphs always leads to problems, but it is not my problem.
 In fact,” he said with a careful glance around him.
 “I would have jumped at the chance myself.” “I am probably too ugly by both AElf and Nymph standards for her to be interested.
 Then again, you know Nymphs; they are naturally polyamorous and very sexual.
 It is a shock that she was not already sexually involved with one or both of us already.” Doi’van added, “Maybe her AElf blood means she does not have as strong a sex drive as most Nymphs since AElven marriage bonds are always monogamous.
 By the Celestial gods she is half AElf and half Nymph, who knows what to expect.
 Humans and Orqui are both in the middle of their two extremes and becoming emotionally involved with either always ends with heartbreak.” Doi’van’s deep voice was just stating a fact, if an unpleasant one.
 Rodregas nodded, he agreed but he was not the young man he looked.
 “I do understand that, and I expect nothing from her.”  He smiled and said, “But I do plan to enjoy what we do have for as long as it lasts.” “And when she takes other lovers?” Doi’van asked.
 Rodregas responded with the only answer he had, “I will do my best to handle it and not get jealous,” he said.

The truth is that I have really great balance, which I had gained from so much fighting.
 I was a little klutzy when I was small, so it was easy for my parents to believe I still was.
 Mom placed the food on the table.
 “Dinner!”
 After dinner I went straight up stairs to go to sleep.
 And hopefully my phone wouldn’t stop me like it did most nights.
 Monsters loved to come out at night and cause trouble.
 They never seem to rest, much to my annoyance.
 I sighed and rolled over, burying my face in my pillow.
 I managed to think about something other than creatures that go bump in the night as I drifted off to sleep.

It must have been over one hundred years ago.” “Wow, that was a long time ago,” I said.
 “You defeated Kojas?” June sighed in frustration.
 “Did you pay any attention to anything?
 Mackenzie, David, Mark and I beat Kojas the first time he appeared.
 It wasn’t easy; let me tell you that right now.” “How did you die?” “Mark died of a wound after we beat Kojas.
 He was too weak to live.
 David and I died in an ambush of what was left of Kojas’ army.
 Mackenzie died from a fatal fall, I don’t remember how.” “Oh,” I said and rubbed my neck.
 “I don’t want to be rude, but do you need to tell me anything else?
 I have to try to come up with a few explanations for back home.” A lot of explanations.

It isn't like anyone is going to pull us over and give us a ticket."
 It was more difficult than I expected to formulate a coherent answer while fighting off the first quivering indications of another attack.
 "She's right, Rachel.
 You should be buckled in."
 I expected her to argue with him.
 No girl on the planet liked it when her older brother sided with her friends against her, but Rachel just frowned a little before scooting back so she could do up her seatbelt.
 Was she really that scared of him?
 I stole a glance at him out of the corner of my eye.
 He didn't look threatening, well, at least no more so than usual.
 Anyone with that many muscles was at least a little threatening.

I want you guys to legally adopt me as a symbol.
 That’s all it could ever be.
 You’ve pretty much been my family since mom left.
 It would…I dunno, it would let me move on, help me to move on I guess.
 Please.
 Art – We’ll see what we can do, guess we should let the rest of the family know, I wish I knew how John was going to take it, probably not well.
 Eugene – (Hugs art)Thank-you Art.
 Art – No problem Gene.
 Just a couple things I would like you to do though.
 Eugene – What do you need?

"Well, I hope it doesn't come to that, but thanks again.
 I may still flunk out, but seeing the expression on her face makes it worthwhile."
 Was it possible to be both shy and confident at the same time?
 If it was, Dominic's fluid, expressive face pulled it off.
 "Nonsense.
 Once we undo all of the damage from her teaching you, you'll do so well even she won't flunk you."
 It went against everything past experience with Mrs. Tiggs had taught me, but I almost believed her.
 Chapter 26 It was amazing how quickly my classes flew by when I had a friend, or at least a protector, with me at all times.
 Then again all of Monday had flown by, not just the school portion of the day, so it really shouldn't have been a surprise today was doing likewise.
 After Spanish, Jasmin had escorted me to Mrs. Campbell's class.

Wounds spotted nearly every one, although no blood poured from them.
 Their saviors were men, orc, and elf, but they were dead.
 “Ashhur help us,” an exhausted farmer murmured before the line advanced upon them.
 The Forest Butcher at their heels, they could not run.
 Velixar’s army of undead tore the seven apart and cast their remains to the dirt.
 So ended the last life of Cornrows.
 !
 [section break](break.png)
 Harruq halted before the mess that had been his prey.
 The line of undead stood motionless, their unfocused eyes looking nowhere.

It was the most filled room I’d ever seen.
 Clutter, but, taken as a whole, it all made sense.
 She called it Plat-Eye Manor, after her dog, Plat-Eye.
 Her three-headed dog.
 (laughs)  That was some dog, used to sit next to me and fix me with its glassy eye, just sit there for hours, man, and I’d end up thinking we were talking.
 I can still remember some of the conversations I had with that damned dog.
 It was black and tan, mostly black—what was it, a mix, part Rottweiler and part hellhound.
 There was no place for the eye to rest, no blank walls, no white spaces.
 And this is like Lorelei herself, really, she is made up of so many parts, she’s a Steppenwolf, in the best sense of that word, a house of mirrors, each part of her reflects a different part of yourself once you get to know her or her you, you dig?
 Anyway, I spent a good half-hour just looking around, while she stood aside and observed me.

The accent was so British I half-wanted to ask him how he ended up in Sanctuary.
 I nodded, scanning his desk while I waited.
 Whethers, Mr. Whethers.
 "Right then, I believe there is a vacancy next to Ms. Samuels in the back."
 People were still trickling into the room, so at least I was spared the full gantlet, but the few gazes I met were still unfriendly until I reached the last table.
 The skinny-ish blond girl already at the table smiled at me as I sat down.
 "Hi, I'm Britney."
 I didn't know what to make of her.
 She looked like the type who was always on the fringe of the popular crowd.
 She was the girl who was the first to follow whatever fad happened to be in, and the first to turn on someone if it would make her just a tad more acceptable to her peers.

The group stared at me.
 “Frey?” Ruby asked.
 I grappled for breath.
 “Just a dream.” A few chuckles moved through the crowd.
 Ruby was more interested.
 “What about?” I glanced at Chevelle, a few paces away.
 He had the same concerned expression as they waited for my answer.
 I only shook my head.
 My chest still ached from panic.
 I sat up and took a drink from the flagon.

Education is the most essential ingredient for this transformation.
 It is a great leveller of social hierarchy.
 It has the power to transform the propensity for violent revolution into ordered evolution.
 It can temper and mature aspirations and enlighten expectations by an under standing of what can reasonably be sought after and achieved.
 It can impart knowledge of opportunities, attitudes that support constructive initiative and skills for productive application.
 Production technologies that make consumer goods available at lower and lower cost to more and more people also level social differences by extending the benefit of development more widely and evenly.
 The soaring of human aspirations is a natural and irresistible result of goals that humankind has been striving for over the last century.
 It is a direct product of the great advances in freedom and democracy, human rights, social equality for women and minorities, health and education, science and technology, the rule of law, social institutions and social welfare.
 Society has no alternative but to meet these growing expectations by channelling the awakened energies into productive pursuits.
 For that we need to acquire a greater understanding of the social and psychological process that has already enabled so many to achieve so much.

Both Doi’van and Rodregas reached out and steadied the young man until it was over.
 Imeralda straightened the sheets for the young squire.
 She then led Rodregas and Doi’van to the figure of a woman.
 She was short and muscular and older than average for the tournament.
 Her bed was more exposed and Rodregas could feel the attention of one of the healers.
 He seemed to be afraid to come over even when the body started to shake in pain.
 After they stepped away from the female squire the healer came over to the other side of the bed from Rodregas and Doi’van and touched the woman’s neck.
 He looked reassured at her vital signs and said, “What did you do?” He looked nervous, though Rodregas was not sure why.
 Imeralda spoke up, “I hope you are not offended, but I am part Nymph and our healing powers work differently than yours.
 She should heal faster for the next few days.” Rodregas hid his smile; it was a good cover story.

Heck, I was already freaking out enough for the both of us.
 This was going on my high school transcript.
 The one colleges would be looking at.
 The one that might have gotten me a scholarship.
 Only now I'd be lucky to pull a 'C' out of the class.
 I tried to control my breathing.
 This wasn't the end of the world.
 I was almost done catching up in Algebra, so I'd have a ton more time.
 If I really worked hard, maybe I'd be okay.
 Most teachers would still offer some kind of extra credit if you begged hard enough.

I didn't usually like taking drugs of any kind, but I had a sharp headache building already.
 I shuffled downstairs, waved a speechless hello to Mom, grabbed my lunch, bag, and books as I absently wondered why there was a cupcake on the counter with a lit candle.
 Mom has always been paranoid about open flames.
 She'd nearly burned down the house as a kid.
 I was halfway to the front door before Mom grabbed my arm and turned me back towards the kitchen.
 "I can't believe you.
 You really would have left without realizing it was your birthday?"
 Ugh.
 No wonder I had a headache.
 My brain must have been working overtime in an effort to block out the fact I was now another year older.

The next day, sometime around midmorning judging from the light coming in through the opening that seemed to function like a window, Imeralda entered along with a young handsome Nymph.
 He was tall with green hair and with a confident bearing to his presence.
 He greeted Rodregas with a very bright smile.
 “I see that you are looking much better,” said the unknown Nymph.
 Imeralda gave the young Nymph a big hug, one that looked far more intimate than Rodregas was comfortable with and she said, “Rodregas, we are so lucky that I was able to get Jordaan to come.
 Durien was working so hard trying to heal you, but your body is so hard to work with.
 He says that the same innate magical ability that makes your body so strong also requires a lot of power to heal.
 Normally Durien can heal even a very seriously wounded person, but he could barely keep you and Doi’van alive.
 I had to leave and run to Fariste to get Jordaan to come.” She was smiling like the sun as she spoke.
 “He was so good to come and just leave at the last moment,” she added.

The rider steadied her best he could, knowing his doom approached.
 They crashed into the inky blackness, crushing bodies underneath before the swarming dead tore them to pieces.
 Velixar’s first attack was far more impressive.
 Bits of bone ripped out from his undead army; femurs, fingers, ribs, and teeth flew into the sky in a deadly assault.
 The elves broke formation as the barrage approached.
 The first ten, however, were too close to have hope.
 Bone shredded wings and scattered feathers.
 The elves that were alive when their horses landed died by the clawing hands of rotted flesh.
 Dieredon looped in the sky, his confidence shaken at the sight of so many of his dying friends.
 He fired arrows three at a time, his quiver never approaching empty.

When I walked through, there were no obvious repercussions and I assumed that, with so many Council members around, they must not have thought it necessary.
 The Council library was overwhelming.
 It housed copies of all the books in the village library as well as hundreds more that were too delicate or important for public use.
 And if you believed Fannie’s theories, they held secret documents here as well, things they didn’t want commonly known.
 The walls were stark white, like carved marble, and the room felt cold and empty, despite the abundance inside.
 I found a shelf to hide behind and placed my pilfered documents on the floor.
 I examined the shelves in front of me, looking for a match to the symbols, and found the sections to be arranged by groups, each shelf divided by categories within.
 I walked the library in search of the section marked for either of the characters listed on my documents, and was about to give up when I noticed some encased racks in the center of the room.
 I checked the small section, seeing immediately the symbols fit.
 I smiled, thinking how easy it had been as I slid my fingertips across the volumes on that shelf.

 When they returned to where Velixar waited, Harruq dropped the head of the noble.
 It rolled twice before stopping face down in the grass.
 “Excellent,” the man in black said.
 He looked his giant warrior up and down.
 “You are wounded.
 Is it serious?”
 “Bah, I can handle far more than this,” Harruq said.
 “I’ll bandage them when we get home.”
 “Very well.

It would just be minimum wage, but I think you'll find you quite enjoy teaching."
 Still at a loss for words, I just nodded.
 I started towards the door as soon as I was dismissed, but stopped at the threshold.
 "Is everything okay Mrs. Campbell?
 I mean it seemed like you were really worried when you left."
 I trailed off, worried by the measuring look that she gave me.
 "I don't suppose you're one of the gossipers, and I guess it wouldn't really matter if you were.
 I got a call that my daughter had been in a car accident.
 By the time I made it out to my car she'd called to tell me she wasn't hurt, just shaken up.
 So, in answer to your question, yes, everything's all right.

He looked at me out of the corner of his eye.
 He'd probably heard my pulse spike.
 Sometimes the fact that he was a shape shifter instead of just a normal boy was pretty inconvenient.
 Of course if he wasn't a shape shifter, then he wouldn't really be Alec.
 "Your mom is likely to be back in town pretty soon.
 Her latest contract has about run its course and it's looking like I'd have to throw a whole bunch of money at her if I wanted to keep her in Europe."
 "I'm not so sure that's really an improvement in topics."
 "You don't want to see your mom?"
 "It's not that, it's just that I know we're not going to be able to spend as much time together.
 It's not like she's going to let me sleep over."

Rodregas had a new strong and powerful body, and he owed a great debt of guilt for that.
 He had even been able to free prisoners and give them a second chance at life.
 How many times had he dreamed of that while the prisoners had pleaded with him?
 He had turned a stone face to the prisoners; he had refused to learn their names, and had just survived by doing his duty.
 Rodregas pulled out the captain’s mattress, he hesitated and walked over to where Imeralda was spreading a blanket and with a smile but no words he pulled up the blanket, and unrolled the mattress and laid the blanket on top.
 She just watched him.
 Rodregas knew she was wondering about his intentions.
 Did he want to share the mattress with her?
 He did of course, but this was a time of new beginnings.
 Rodregas would live and die like he had always meant to.

When he raised his head, she whimpered, wanting his mouth on hers again.
 But she gasped with pleasure as he began nibbling on her earlobe.
 Rick wanted to do much more than kiss her, and she was making it difficult to resist.
 He'd never held a woman so eager, so responsive to his slightest touch.
 But he had to stop.
 He had to stop now.
 He raised his head, straightening and pulling away.
 But Marie clung to him, rubbing her face against his neck.
 "Kiss me again, please," she murmured, raising her head to press her lips to his.
 He couldn't resist her, and his mouth began moving over hers again.

I tried to inject the proper amount of blonde stupidity into my words, but wasn't sure it worked until I felt Alec's arms tighten almost painfully around me.
 I gasped, and he set me down so quickly I almost fell over.
 Before I'd even regained my balance, he was walking away, moving so quickly I would've needed to run to keep up.
 Even so, he hadn't turned away quick enough to hide the complete disdain in his expression.
 I suddenly found myself wishing I'd told him the truth rather than making him think I was stupid and manipulative.
 It was too late.
 He was already out of sight, and by now his opinion of me was fixed.
 Chapter 4 School hadn't gotten any worse after I'd convinced the hottest boy on the planet that I was a complete waste of oxygen, but it hadn't gotten any better either.
 Mrs. Tiggs, my Spanish teacher, had seemed every bit as mean as my Biology teacher from earlier in the day, and it had been a relief when Britney had finally dropped me off at home.
 I watched Britney's little white Saturn disappear down the lane with a complex set of feelings that included a bit of loneliness and more than a little relief.

The reason it took so long for my brain to start working again was that I couldn't seem to think about anything other than Alec.
 He was looking down at me with an expression I'd never seen on his face before.
 I still couldn't read it, but it was new and somehow seemed like it belonged there more than his normal impenetrable mask.
 "What's going on?
 Is she okay?"
 The sub had finally pushed his way through the crowd, and looked like he was about two steps away from a total panic.
 Alec stood, and it wasn't until I went up at the same time that I realized he was carrying me.
 "I think she'll be fine, but maybe I should get her to the nurse.
 Just to be sure."
 Even as he was talking, Alec was moving towards the door.

I pushed through the water, gasping and cold, struggling to climb from the muck as I stood and walked out.
 I was drenched, the material of the long gown soaked and heavy and more uncomfortable than ever.
 I loosened the wet corset ties and dropped the dress into a pile at my feet, shivering as I stepped free of it and onto a rock.
 I grabbed a shirt from the pile, and then the slim pants, aware of how nice the fabric felt, how good the cut.
 A leather vest laced over the top.
 It seemed they were tailored for me.
 I’d never had such luck making my own clothes.
 These were trim and fit, made for traveling.
 Not that I knew where I was going.
 My desire to trail Chevelle had been smashed, but there was no way I could return to the village.

I know that you're engaged, and I know--" "But that's it.
 That's what I'm talking about.
 I can't marry Davis."
 His eyes widened, and he seized her in his arms.
 "Oh, sweetheart, that's fantastic!"
 He took her face in his hands and rained kisses on her mouth.
 "I couldn't bear to lose you."
 He threaded his fingers into her hair, nuzzling her temple.
 "L-lose me?"
 she breathed.

One minute I was minding my own business trying to pretend like I didn't notice the nasty looks some of Brandon's friends were shooting my way when they thought I wasn't looking, the next I was going to the biggest dance of the year with the most popular guy in school.
 I'd half thought Cassie was going to rip out my throat.
 I walked past a pair of gorgeous, gold-fringed drapes, handed my ticket to a distinguished-looking man in a uniform, and then smiled as he pointed me towards my door.
 It was almost a relief to be around strangers again.
 He'd been polite, but hadn't tried to fawn over me.
 My being asked out had changed my treatment from almost every girl at school.
 Half the student body, the more sensible portion it seemed, had all decided that I was some kind of massively stuck-up slut.
 The other half had decided they needed to be my new best friend if they wanted to get invited to any of the cool parties ever again.
 It might not have bothered me except the girls who now hated me were the ones I generally would've gotten along with, at least as much as I ever got along with anyone.
 My leaving Brandon's insane bouquet of flowers at the office instead of lugging it around all day should have helped.

He was apparently a record-keeper for Grand Council and was responsible for copying scrolls and adding new information for each of the northern clans from their various local libraries.
 Some of the information was sketchy: gossip from the neighboring fairy guild about strange activities and reports from travelers about deserted villages.
 Or maybe not deserted.
 One description seemed to imply the village was empty not only of elves, but all evidence it had ever been inhabited.
 There were maps of the mountains and forests, showing each village and town.
 Curved lines of azure cut through the page, rivers and streams, and I had a pang of regret for not studying maps with Junnie.
 The next pages were a copy of the record-keeper’s report to Grand Council about his findings.
 And his conclusion.
 There were definitely missing pages here, but something dreadful had happened for certain.
 His official report should have been factual and serious, but the description was loaded with fear.

I really don’t know where to start..
 Doctor – Well just start where you feel you must.
 Character 1- ah were to start, were to start, were to start….
 Doctor – (Yells) Shutup and talk!
 Character 1- (jumps in surprise) ah yes, well, errr….my mother was a hippy back in the 60s and 70s, and she had a drug habit a mile wide.
 She was addicted to hard stuff by the time me and my sister were born.
 And she eventually passed on her addictions to us in one degree or another.
 Let me just say that being an asprin junkie at the age of 6 is a low point in my life, but I’m extremely proud to have beaten it.
 Well as a kid she used to scare my sister and me with horror stories about the Republican Party and conservatives in general, with the stories about rush Limbaugh being the worst of the lot.
 In fact it wasn’t until just a couple years ago that I could watch a speech by one of their number without wetting myself and shaking in fear.

I crept up and peered at where he was pointing.
 A bunch of dwarves and tall, muscular men crowded around something.
 The men had double swords sheathed on their back, long ears, and long black hair.
 They were wearing some type of combat boots and thick coats.
 One of them moved and I saw a tied dragon staked to the ground.
 It continued to try to stand but it seemed to weak and fell back down.
 I heard Emily gasp in horror and I felt the same way.
 One of the men poked it in the side with the butt of his sword and the dragon grunted in pain.
 I looked over my shoulder at Emily.
 She looked like she was about to start crying any second.

she asked.
 "One's downtown, and the other is to the northwest of the city.
 Our hotel is right off the highway--we're almost there."
 "When will we see the movie studios?"
 "One tomorrow, one Tuesday.
 We'll get some brochures at the hotel and see what else sounds good to you for the rest of the week."
 They pulled up to the hotel minutes later.
 They checked into their rooms, which were side by side, and Rick suggested that Marie unpack while he ordered a pizza.
 "I don't feel like unpacking and sitting around.
 Can't we go out for dinner?"

His stomach growled as the aroma of cooked meat filled his nostrils.
 “Glad you approve,” Qurrah said.
 They ate in silence until only bones remained, which Qurrah then tucked away in a pouch.
 Harruq relaxed and enjoyed the heat while his brother tightened his robe and leaned toward the fire.
 “Things are more dangerous now, aren’t they?” Harruq asked after a pause.
 Qurrah nodded, his thoughts distant.
 “They’re ready for us.
 Many elves will be lurking inside the woods as they hunt for the Forest Butcher.” Again Qurrah chuckled at the name his brother had earned.
 “Will we stop for a while?” Harruq asked.
 The smaller half-orc shook his head.

He spoke in a low voice, though the others didn’t appear to be listening.
 I had to strain to hear.
 “I’ve been thinking about the bindings.” I turned to face him, his deep blue eyes on mine as he continued, “I was thinking there might be another way.” He was hesitant for some reason.
 “How?” I demanded, keeping the volume as low as I could, palms pressed to the smooth rock beneath us.
 What is he waiting on?
 “If… well, it seems you may have more control over your thoughts than you realize?” He phrased it as a question.
 Because of my secret.
 Was he trying to be respectful of it, or trying to keep me from getting upset?
 I wasn’t sure how to answer.
 But if it helped, if there was a way to unbind me, free my mind and get back the magic… I settled on a, “Mm-hm?” He nearly smiled.

Chevelle stiffened at my side as he often did when Steed touched me so casually, and I couldn’t help but think of being alone with him after tonight.
 My stomach tightened and suddenly in comparison the mountains didn’t seem like such a big deal.
 The next morning Steed said goodbye privately to Chevelle and then came to where I stood with the horses, stroking one’s neck.
 “You’ll remember me, butterfly?” I smiled in return.
 “Always.” “Yes, well, at least as long as he’s yours.” He patted the horse.
 “Mine?” He smiled and swung onto his horse, nodding farewell as he spun and galloped east.
 My horse knelt and Chevelle offered his hand to help me get seated.
 My grin widened as he mounted his horse and he looked back at me questioningly.
 “I’ll name him Steed,” I announced proudly.
 Chevelle pressed his eyes closed, shaking his head as I patted the horse’s neck once more.

Then I got a glimpse of what it had killed and I had to hold back my tears.
 The poor body of the dwarf who had brought us here was lying in a contorted heap, limbs twisted in all directions.
 The scene was awful and I had to prevent myself from throwing up.
 Then I knew why they beat and killed him.
 All the other dwarves were on Kojas.
 This dwarf must have betrayed Kojas to bring information to whoever “her majesty” was and to help us into Igneeria.
 I suddenly knew that this dwarf was much braver than we had given him credit for.
 I suddenly felt awful because I knew who the thing was.
 Kojas.

Since Eric still wanted to work out and wouldn’t face the world without a shower afterward, Cliff invited him to share his locker.
 Besides running the mile during track season, Cliff was second man on the cross-country team, behind Gary Hafner.
 Eric used the locker for a couple weeks before Coach Gory summoned Cliff to his office, sat him down, and asked him to explain why a new sweat suit just issued to Gary Hafner had turned up missing and gotten found in Cliff’s locker.
 Cliff maintained that he’d never even seen the sweat suit.
 “It looks like Eric stole them,” Coach said.
 “Eric doesn’t steal,” Cliff said adamantly.
 Still, when Coach Gory dropped Cliff from the cross-country and track teams, he got afflicted with anger and confusion, wondering if Eric might’ve been the thief after all.
 For a week or so, he seethed and Eric brooded, ashamed even that Cliff would suspect him.
 They passed each other in the halls without a greeting.
 It took the end of the world to renew their friendship.

If he succeeded, she would know what Rodregas had done; if he failed, well he was familiar enough with that feeling.
 He saw her lips forming something under her breath, probably a spell, but she did not have time to execute a spell of sufficient strength in the time left her.
 Magic took too long to prepare to be useful so quickly.
 Ravenhurr stepped into the last circle; the one made entirely of what appeared to be fresh blood and of symbols made from the careful placement of living organs.
 Rodregas breathed in deeply, trying to settle himself, and almost gagged from the smells: the stench of fresh blood, the scent of fear from the prisoners, the smell of power, and other smells that he could not identify.
 Rodregas closed down on himself, “Duty,” he thought.
 “My real duty this time, focus on the next step.
 I can do this.” As Rodregas raised the club, he kept his eyes away from the AElf maiden not wanting to give himself away to anyone watching.
 “Gods,” Rodregas quietly prayed.
 “You have never answered my prayers.

"Pizza," Rick muttered, gazing down into her dazed face.
 "Hmmm?"
 "Pizza's here."
 He released her to go open the door.
 Marie turned away to collect herself as he paid the delivery man.
 She hadn't even heard the knock.
 Her face grew scarlet as she thought of the way she'd touched him.
 And she'd even admitted that she enjoyed it!
 How could she have acted that way?
 Rick set the pizza on the table and picked up some change to go get them some Cokes.

My hair and clothing were drenched in sweat and I was near surrender.
 And then, with no more warning than when the first pains came, it was over.
 A small, sweet child was in my arms.
 I drew in ragged breaths as I cleaned her face.
 I wiped her eyes and they came open, an unbelievable shade of dark green, sparkling like emeralds.
 She was a beauty.
 I wasn’t aware the room had grown silent until I wiped her ears and heard my own gasp.
 They were slightly rounded at the tips… almost blunt.
 I realized I had stopped breathing as I read, so engrossed in the story.
 I reached up absentmindedly to stroke the tops of my ears.

Marry me."
 He took her hand, sliding the ring onto her third finger.
 She shook her head, gazing at the ring as tears ran down her cheeks.
 "Just over five weeks ago, I had a fight with Davis.
 I was confused and didn't have a chance to talk to my mother about it.
 I needed to and was going to, after I'd walked through the garden and thought about it and it was time for her to be awake .
 .
 .
 but instead I walked into your garden, into 2011."
 The tears began flowing faster down her cheeks.

Then I saw this ghost-like girl before I saw you.
 Then I woke up.” Seth nodded.
 “Mine was calling my name too and said to beware of the shadows.
 But I saw a ghost-like boy instead.
 Then I saw a glimpse of you and then I woke up.” “Who do you think they were?” I asked.
 “The ghost kids.” “I don't know but I have a feeling that they weren't on Kojas' side,” he replied.
 I glanced over at Emily and Jason, making sure they were still sleeping.
 “Why do you think they were in our dreams?
 Was the 'beware of the shadows' that important?” “Does any of this ever make sense to us?” Seth asked with a shrug.
 “We just wait it out like we always do.” Emily groaned and stretched.

He was already out of sight, and by now his opinion of me was fixed.
 Chapter 4 School hadn't gotten any worse after I'd convinced the hottest boy on the planet that I was a complete waste of oxygen, but it hadn't gotten any better either.
 Mrs. Tiggs, my Spanish teacher, had seemed every bit as mean as my Biology teacher from earlier in the day, and it had been a relief when Britney had finally dropped me off at home.
 I watched Britney's little white Saturn disappear down the lane with a complex set of feelings that included a bit of loneliness and more than a little relief.
 After a minute or two spent staring off into space, I finally decided the discomfort in my stomach was sharp enough to justify the effort of eating.
 Given the ridiculous heat, studying was the last thing I wanted to do, but there wasn't really anything else to do so I changed into cooler clothes and made the best of it.
 Three hours later my brain felt like it was going to run out of my nose, so I wandered upstairs.
 It was still too hot for comfort in my room, but unpacking in the heat was better than facing the math problems waiting for me downstairs.
 We'd partially unpacked things to get my bedspread out, so everything else went pretty quickly.
 My room wasn't particularly large, but someone had put a long shelf around the top of the room, and the closet had more storage space than my room back home.

When you’re young, you know?
 I wrote “Tunc” and “Birdie Sings” for her, of course.
 Early stuff.
 Unrecorded, but always in our sets back then.
 I still like “Tunc.”  Hm.
 Maybe it’ll re-emerge as an acoustic ballad.
 I’ll have to think about it.

It was a pale shadow of what it felt like to lose a family member, but it was made up of too many of the same elements.
 One of the chaperons, an over-bleached woman who looked like she was struggling to deny her last eight or nine birthdays, had to call my name at least twice to shake me out of my funk.
 I followed everyone else out to the bus, but there wasn't any refuge there.
 I was just too different from everyone else.
 Hour after hour passed in silent misery, until finally the rest of the kids wore themselves out and it quieted down enough for me to lapse into a fitful sleep.
 I was smack-dab in the middle of a dream about Rachel and Britney when everything changed.
 Ever so slowly, the normal dreamscape took on a sharp-edged glow, and then morphed into the breathtaking colors that'd wormed their way even deeper into my heart than I'd realized.
 I didn't recognize my surroundings, but they were different than any of the places I'd been before.
 The new scents whipping past me on the breeze were sign enough even if I hadn't been able to detect the subtle differences in the light emanating off of the foliage paving the trail I was walking along.
 For the length of the dream I lost myself in the wonder of experiencing the world in all of its amazing depth.

One product of these studies could be the development of specific job coefficients measuring the impact of growth in trade in different industries on overall employment.
 Trade becomes of even greater potential benefit to industrial nations during the coming decade when economic growth in these countries is expected to be significantly slower than in the developing world.
 The pent-up demand generated by the destruction of Europe during the Second World War, the rapid expansion of population during the baby boom generation, and the explosion of new technologies in the past few decades, all generated strong internal demand in the OECD countries, resulting in steady economic growth.
 The slow growth of population and productivity in more recent years means that these factors cannot be expected to drive further economic expansion at the same rate.
 In contrast, average growth rates in developing countries are expected to be two to three times higher than in the industrial nations.
 The increase in the dollar output of developing countries was actually bigger than that of the most economically advanced nations in 1992 and 1993, and this trend is expected to continue.
 Measured in terms of purchasing power parity, developing countries now represent more than one-third of the world economy.
 More than 40 per cent of US exports now go to developing countries and two-thirds of the increase in US exports in recent years has gone to these nations.
 The rising expectations and upward mobility of millions of people in developing countries represent a vast potential source of demand, higher incomes and jobs for the West.
 Increasing incomes among the poorest countries has the greatest multiplier effect on global aggregate demand, because even small increments in per capita income can lead to large increases in the number of households with incomes above the threshold for buying consumer goods.

He thought I wouldn’t give up because I’d seen the map.
 Something about that nagged at me, but Ruby waited while I searched for a response.
 Chevelle opened the door and I knew I was saved from at least that much.
 When he saw me, he was struck still.
 I had forgotten Ruby’s “treatments” until she squealed in delight at his response.
 He composed his face again, but she’d already marked him.
 “Oh, you like it.
 She’s fabulous, isn’t she?” She was so proud of herself, but I could tell Chevelle was embarrassed he’d been caught off guard.
 It might have pleased me too, except that I couldn’t tell if it was less how I had changed and more the resemblance to my mother.
 Ruby offered Chevelle a drink and he sat in a chair beside mine.

Everyone from Jagger—who copped his singing style—to The Animals to Jimmy Page have accorded him a special place in their learning.
 And I knew him, man.
 Knew him as teacher/mentor/friend.
 It was as if I’d been sanctified.
 Another father.
 He taught me “Don’t Let the Sun Pull Your Pants Down,” “Piggly Wiggly Blues,” “She Caught the Katy,” “Her Ass Moves I Moan.”  Underground stuff, stuff from the adult’s table, from the back room.
 And I lapped it up.
 And Tennessee paid me the high compliment, man.
 He told me nobody played like me except Riley.

 Will you?
 The whole world is full of blind fools who laugh at anyone who can see the truth and dare to talk about what they see.

 Jim – That ain’t funny.

Rodregas felt a stab in his back as he took either an arrow or a sword.
 He was groggy with pain, and both weak and filled with rage.
 The guard in his hands was thrashing and spasming in unspeakable pain.
 As the guard collapsed to the ground, Rodregas fell with him.
 He tried to once more roll to the side, struggling away from a potential final stroke.
 Rodregas’ face was covered in gore and blood.
 It was hard for him to see.
 He struggled back up, but fell, then Rodregas felt a presence to his right.
 It was too small to be Doi’van and Rodregas staggered over reaching for him, determined to take one final slaver with him.
 His wounded leg buckled again, and Rodregas tried to reach for the ground to slow his fall, but something was wrong with his arm and it did not move.

The computer is an instrument and a catalyst that can stimulate creation of employment and self-employment opportunities in virtually every field – from farming, fishing and textile designing to lean manufacturing, financial services, bio-informatics and genetic engineering.
 While the application of computers has already been extended to all these fields, there has not yet been a systematic effort to assess the employment potential that can be tapped by fully extending and accelerating this movement.
 The recent initiative in India to establish knowledge centres in every Indian village by 2007 is one example of a pioneering effort to harness ICT as a means to catalyze a whole range of on-farm and off-farm rural activities, which will inevitably translate into more and higher productivity and greater employment generation.
 These centres can be utilized to deliver technological expertise to upgrade farm yields, vocational training and education, purchasing and marketing information to raise incomes.
 The experience of India also shows that bridging the digital divide helps to bridge the gender divide in the area of knowledge and skill-intensive work.
 As the construction of rural roads acts as a stimulus to agricultural development of isolated communities by connecting them with sources of inputs and markets in the outer world, ICT can be a catalyst for stimulating the entire gamut of economic activities in rural communities throughout the developing world.
 At the other end of the spectrum, ICT is opening up unparalleled opportunities for self-employment and new business creation for the educated.
 Today more than 50 per cent of American workers utilize computers in their work.
 The growth of the World Wide Web has given rise to on-line global markets in which individuals can bid for a broad range of projects involving activities such as research, translation, technical writing, proofreading, desktop publishing, and business consulting.
 A new publication identifies a few hundred self-employment opportunities of this kind.

I guess I should at least be glad you aren't going to lie to me.
 Unless you really didn't ever want to go, and were lying to me all along."
 Rachel shrank in on herself a little.
 It almost looked like she was going to cry, which should have made me feel bad, but I was too mad to care.
 I'd been miserable the whole way there, and especially the whole way back, and then she wanted to just pretend like none of it had happened.
 Rachel's lip trembled slightly as she finally managed to get a response out.
 "This isn't like you.
 Why are you doing this?"
 Cindi used to do the exact same thing.
 Her 'woe is me, I don't understand what is happening act' had usually worked with Dad, and it'd always infuriated me.

Not trusting my voice, I nodded and took the couple of steps needed to reach his passenger door.
 "I wanted to apologize for what happened earlier today.
 Cassie can be a real jerk sometimes."
 It was too good to be true.
 I almost looked over at him, but I knew I'd lose myself in a pair of soft, gray eyes.
 Brandon seemed to understand that my silence meant I wasn't convinced.
 "You wouldn't believe how relieved I was when you stepped forward and stopped her before things got out of hand."
 My natural pessimism reasserted itself, undaunted by the fact that I could just see Brandon's exquisitely-muscled arm out of the corner of my eye.
 "If you knew Cassie was in the wrong, why didn't you stop her?
 She's your friend; you should have been able to defuse the situation before it got that far."

122–24).
 PROSPERITY 2000 STRATEGY FOR INDIA
 The potential for accelerating job creation and increasing food production through a mix of the strategies discussed in this report is illustrated by the strategy which ICPF has proposed to achieve full employment in India and thereby to raise the entire population above the poverty line by generating additional employment opportunities for 100 million persons in the coming decade.
 This strategy utilizes agriculture as an engine for growth by accelerating the development of commercial agriculture, agro-industry and agro-exports.
 It calls for a shift in thinking concerning agriculture from production for survival and subsistence to production for maximum and sustainable profit, from emphasis on meeting minimum needs to realizing maximum potentials, from commodity-based to resource-based planning.
 It seeks to tap the country's competitive advantage in labour-intensive agricultural crops and allied industries to double agricultural production - raising the annual growth rate to 4 per cent (versus 2.3 per cent in the 1980s) - achieve complete nutritional self-sufficiency, raise rural incomes and double India's total exports.
 Creating new jobs through this low-cost strategy can be accomplished entirely with the country's own resources, though foreign firms will find investment in India's agro-industrial sector very attractive.
 Initially, about half of the new jobs will be generated on farms by raising productivity through methods to improve management of micro-nutrients and water, expanding the total irrigated area by more complete utilization of the substantial additional capacity that has already been created, emphasis on more labour-intensive commercial crops such as sugar, cotton, fruit, flowers, and vegetables, sericulture, inland and coastal aquaculture, reclamation of wastelands for forestry and fodder, and increasing subsidiary incomes from animal husbandry and poultry.
 The expansion and intensification of cultivation of these products will raise agricultural output by $25 billion and generate approximately 45 million equivalent full-time unskilled and semi-skilled jobs in agriculture for unemployed and under-employed farmers and landless labour.
 The additional agricultural production will form raw material for expansion of rural industrialization and non-farm employment.

trusting.
 She trusted him not to hurt her, to do what was best for her.
 Groaning, he rolled off her.
 Marie immediately pushed herself up and over to lie on top of him, her mouth claiming his again.
 He couldn't help returning her kiss, but when she began kissing his neck, he croaked, "Sweetheart, please stop."
 She paused for just a second.
 But then she ran her hand over his chest, nibbling on his earlobe as she whispered, "I don't think I can."
 He groaned again.
 It had taken all the strength he had to make himself stop.
 If she kept kissing him, no power on earth, no amount of love or guilt would be able to make him stop.

"You're the most beautiful woman in the world, Marie."
 This evening was a wonderful end to a wonderful day.
 Like the day before, what Rick had enjoyed most was seeing Marie's pleasure.
 She'd wanted to see everything, experience everything they'd let her try.
 Everyone had treated her like an eager tourist, little realizing that she was seeing it all from the perspective of someone who'd seen debuts of Hollywood's earliest offerings.
 "Would you like to go dancing?"
 Rick asked as he paid the bill.
 "I don't think so.
 I'm rather tired, and I think I'd just like to relax and think about all that happened today."
 "And dream about your debut?"

So, I did some demos, at Ardent with Jim’s help, and others, I just wrote, you know, just committed them to paper and John helped me get them disseminated.
 It worked well then to do that.
 I don’t know if it still does.
 Probably, though I don’t do that anymore.
 I’m writing, obviously, for myself more these days.
 So, money was coming in, we were playing regionally.
 We opened for The Airplane at the Coliseum.
 For Canned Heat in Little Rock.
 We were part of a triple bill with The James Gang and Rare Earth in Nashville.
 In Nashville, we were hanging out with Dylan and Johnny Cash, you know, Dylan introduced us, calling us, “the best blues group since Graham Bond.”  Bob, he gets this reputation for being aloof, but, man, that is one generous cat, you gotta know him.

The challenges posed by extremely rapid transition are nowhere more graphically depicted than in the current transition of the countries of Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the end of the Cold War and the break-up of the USSR.
 Although this transition is often described in political and economic terms, it is far broader and deeper in its implications.
 These nations are in the midst of a simultaneous multi-dimensional transformation – politically, from authoritarian to democratic forms of government; economically, from a centrally planned command system to free market economies; industrially, from defence-oriented to consumer-oriented production; administratively, from highly centralized to decentralized systems; structurally, from state ownership of property to multiple forms of ownership in all spheres; socially, from closed and isolated to open and internationally integrated societies; culturally, from almost exclusive emphasis on values of equity and collective security to strong emphasis on the values of freedom and individual responsibility.
 The transformation of Eastern Europe and the former USSR is of vital concern to all of us.
 Never before in human history has such massive change been carried out as an essentially peaceful revolution.
 The end of apartheid in South Africa and recent progress in the Middle East show that this process continues to have beneficial repercussions around the world.
 At the same time, this incredible advance has been accompanied by events that have destabilized the political and economic systems of the entire region, led to the break-up of the USSR, war in Bosnia, the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the COMECON trade system, a massive brain drain and the threat of huge waves of economic refugees.
 These changes, too, have had implications for all nations within the region and beyond – severely affecting trade around the world, from the tea estates of Sri Lanka and India to the wheat fields of the United States, Australia and Argentina.
 So, too, the further course of this transition will have a profound impact on all nations, both developed and developing.
 The future of world peace, the world political system and the world economy hang in the balance.

If Isaac had been the one close enough to reach out and touch, I probably would've tried to get his attention and said hi.
 With Vincent, I just stayed quiet and hoped he wouldn't notice me.
 I didn't want to risk tripping and making my ankle worse, so I was paying especially close attention to where my feet were going.
 If I hadn't been looking down, I would have completely missed it.
 I still almost thought I'd imagined it, but there was no denying that Vincent's foot snaked out and nudged the ankle of the kid in front of him just hard enough to trip the smaller guy.
 The result was all out of proportion to what I expected.
 The smaller boy fell forward, careening towards the banister with so much force he knocked people in front of him out of the way.
 Just before I left elementary school someone had read us a newspaper article about some poor guy being pushed over a railing and falling to his death.
 I'd had nightmares for months.
 Dreams where the stairs had turned slick and I'd slid all the way down them.

 Antonil clasped the man on the shoulder.
 “Thank you.
 If there was a way I could stop this, I would.”
 “Then stop it.”
 “You know I can’t.”
 “You can!
 Defy the king’s orders.
 Stop the bloodshed that his fear and paranoia are about to unleash.”
 “An elf came, killed several nobles, and took the king’s ear.

Art – No, just behave yourself, I know you know how.
 Do we have a deal?
 Eugene – I’ll do my best.
 Old habits die hard, but I’ll be good.
 What was the other thing you wanted?
 Art – Good, the second thing was just some information.
 Eugene – What sort of information?
 Art – Jim was telling me about your stint with Christianity…
 Eugene – Oh damn.
 Art - …But he never got to finish the story.

She raised her face and, when her eyes met mine, they narrowed.
 Part of me was aware I should have been scared, but I was enjoying myself.
 Whatever pain I might receive didn’t factor; I had wanted to hurt this wicked little redhead since the first time I’d seen her, since her hand reached out seductively toward Chevelle and collected my ruby.
 My palms lit where they wrapped around her arms.
 I would finally burn her.
 She cocked one eyebrow at me.
 “Half fire fairy, silly.” And I flew through the air to land with a heavy thump a few yards away.
 “Well, it was a little unconventional, but at least you’re thinking on your feet,” she mused, straightening the material of her skirt.
 And then she giggled as she realized I was, in fact, not on my feet.
 My body ached as I stood and my best skill was useless.

The dwarf was acting different than the others; its pudgy eyes were filled with fear at the sight of my arrow.
 “Why?” Seth growled.
 “Your kind has done nothing good to us except make us confused and our lives more complicated.” The dwarf looked startled.
 “Oh you’ll have to excuse my brethren; they have a tendency to be rather annoying.” He took a long frightened look at Seth’s sword.
 “Good sir, before you try to slay me, I have a message to deliver from her majesty.” I lowered my bow because I had a feeling I wanted to know what this message was.
 If it was a lie, Seth and I could kill him anyway in a blink of an eye.
 “Seth, maybe we should hear what he has to say.” “I’ve had enough of listening to dwarfs,” Seth hissed.
 “All they bring me is bad news.” The dwarf was trembling.
 “Oh please, sir, listen to the good lady!
 I do not bring news that will cause you pain, but I bring news of the pain of others.

Emily twirled her hair, “I know but I’m just curious.” I bit my lip.
 “If we do end up fighting this guy, you’ll get your wish.” Minutes later, Jason emerged from the trees and dropped his travel bag on the ground.
 He leaned against the statue next to Emily, giving us both feeble smiles.
 “So,” he said, trying to sound happy, “travel day today, huh?” We didn’t answer.
 “Okay looks like I’ll do the talking,” Jason said.
 “You two excited?” Emily shook her head.
 “No, Jason we’re both jumping for joy, but it’s so deep down that instead we both look like we want to slug you,” I said sarcastically.
 Jason sighed, “Okay, you would say something like that.
 I thought in a mood like this you would be less…annoying.” As soon as he finished his sentence, I wacked him as hard as I could.
 Seth showed up after that, placed his bag on the ground, leaned on the statue next to me, and didn’t say a word.

No blood ran from them.
 “You must do far better than that,” he said, his fingers hooked in strange positions.
 Another blast of dark power washed over Dieredon.
 He felt his right shoulder crack into fragments.
 Darkness swam before his eyes, darkness dominated by twin red orbs.
 The elf reached into a small pocket of his armor and drew out a glass vial.
 “Healing potions will not aid you,” Velixar mocked.
 “This is no healing potion,” Dieredon said.
 He threw the vial.
 It shattered.

Under these circumstances, the international community, through the UN, should have the right and accept the responsi bility to intervene appropriately.
 The need of the hour is not to undermine the legitimate right of nations to self-determination, but rather to protect that right by more clearly demarcating its legitimate boundaries against the highly visible challenges being posed by forces of disintegration and fragmentation from within.
 The current tendency for states to fragment along ethnic lines cannot be handled by any abstract principle of international law.
 It depends on the understanding and will of people.
 The evolution of larger, heterogeneous national units functioning under principles of equality is an outstanding product of civilization that should not and cannot be reversed without great damage to the general welfare of humanity.
 The only solution is to work constantly to educate the public in all countries to understand the benefits of national integration and international cooperation.
 The implications of this view will be endorsed by some and opposed by others.
 Acceptance must be fostered through education and discussion rather than unilateral forced initiative.
 Preventive Diplomacy, Peace Making and Peace Building
 The answers to the questions regarding national sovereignty and international responsibility will determine the scope of UN preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace building in years to come.

I know.” She held her tongue out for me to examine.
 As she pressed another arrow against it, tiny slits opened up and released a translucent liquid.
 “Not really venom, per se, all fairies have it.
 A chemical to help break down their food.
 Just that mine is toxic to many.
 Not to worry though, I have pretty good control of it now.
 Nasty, poisonous stuff.” She laughed again, “You know, that’s what Chevelle thought I intended the first time I dusted you.” I recalled the panic in his voice before he whisked her away.
 As disastrous a night as that had been, this one hadn’t gone much better.
 “Ruby, please take Frey back to the house.” Chevelle was standing behind us.
 I was too exhausted to jump, but Ruby merely glanced back at him, not at all surprised he was there.

She picked us up at the airport and I think her head almost turned in a circle when she saw us.
 Our hair was down to the middle of our backs and we were as dark as natives.
 It was crazy times then.
 Chapter 9: Times They Are a Changing Back in Sacramento, freebasing and disco were big.
 Before long, one of my roommates was busted with an abundance of cocaine and I narrowly missed the arrest.
 I was literally driving away from the house and saw cop cars coming down the street toward it.
 I watched in the rearview mirror as they surrounded the house and I knew he was inside high on free-base and well supplied with cocaine.
 Shortly thereafter I decided to move away and find a new environment.
 Sacramento seemed like it was now completely out of control!
 People were staying up for days on end freebasing, and it was not fun being around someone who is focused on his next fix or dolling out drugs to fellow addicts.

“Get rid of it,” Harruq said as he picked up the other sword the orc had dropped.
 “You disagree?” Qurrah asked, his delight vanishing into a sudden frown.
 “No,” Harruq said.
 He thought to explain and then just shrugged.
 “It makes me uneasy,” he said instead.
 “But do as you wish.”
 The frailer brother approached the end of the alley where the sound of combat was strongest.
 His steps faltered only once.
 When Harruq moved to catch him, Qurrah glared and leaned against the side of a house.
 When a luckless orc rushed too close to the exit, Qurrah hurled the orb.

“Your wounds are beyond saving,” she said softly.
 “I’m sorry.”
 She ended his pain with a small lance of ice through his forehead.
 “Thank you for your aid,” one of the elves said.
 “We must fall back to the forest.
 If they chase us there, it will be suicide.”
 “We will not have to fall back so far,” Felewen disagreed.
 “They have scattered about our town.
 Their numbers mean nothing now.
 Besides,” she grinned, “we have Aurelia Thyne.”

He felt his body, now without armor, for any serious wounds.
 “The good news is that while the tip of the lance did slice into your chest a bit, it is almost healed thanks to what Jordaan did,” said Doi’van standing above him.
 Rodregas realized he was lying on the ground over by where Doi’van had been keeping the lances and equipment.
 The spare lances were gone.
 He had lost.
 Doi’van was of course referring to the healing sigil.
 He wisely did not say it out loud as every squire there would have been asking about where they had gotten one.
 Rodregas started to get up, but quickly decided it was smarter to stay lying down for now.
 “Where did we finish?” he asked.
 “Actually we did pretty good.

“The king must be desperate for workers,” Qurrah said.
 He raised an eyebrow at his brother.
 “I take it you’re interested?”
 “I’m strong enough for whatever they want from me,” Harruq insisted.
 “We have no need for money.” Qurrah reminded him.
 “We take what we need.
 We always have.”
 “My days are spent in boredom and you know it,” Harruq said.
 “How long will they offer that much coin?”
 Qurrah popped his neck, wincing as he did.

 How the bloody abyss did he say his name?”
 He stopped when he realized the soldiers were staring at him with none-too- happy looks on their faces.
 “Oh, hello,” he said, doing his best to smile.
 “I was looking for, er, Alvrik.
 He was just in the center of town, and…”
 “Does the orcie want some money?” one of the guards asked.
 He jabbed his elbow into the soldier next to him as both laughed in Harruq’s face.

“I use magic, Frey.” He looked like he was waiting for me to be upset.
 “Oh.” I contemplated his answer.
 “I thought maybe you had a knife.” He smirked.
 “Yes, well, that would have been easy enough.” “And Junnie prefers to hunt… for sport?” He had that look again and I wondered why he would be so cautious.
 Because I was dangerous?
 A practitioner of dark magic?
 “No.
 Some prefer the meat not to be tainted by magic.
 They feel it is more… pure.” He pronounced ‘tainted’ with an edge.

She was right.
 Nearly everyone left over the next little while as they either finished up their assignments, gave up, or finally filled whatever quota of study time they'd been given by their parents.
 I did get to answer a couple of questions, which was surprisingly fun.
 When there was only half an hour left Mrs. Campbell walked over.
 "Good job so far.
 Albert, the other tutors, and I are all going to head out.
 Stay here until closing time, and then you're free to go.
 We'll see you tomorrow."
 I watched as my new co-workers trickled out, and then looked around at the nearly empty room.
 Rachel was still sitting at her desk in the middle of the room, and Britney was still pouting from her new, assigned seat.

 Liz – You were never a Boy Scout.

People were roaming around the grounds doing everything from raking leaves to just hanging in groups, but each one stopped what they were doing to examine us as we drove in.
 We could immediately tell that visitors to this desolate location were rare.
 Brandon approached the vehicle with enthusiasm and the brightest broadest smile we have ever seen on his face.
 We instantly noticed his weight gain and he proudly announced through our open car window that he was nearing 170 pounds, and he looked healthy for the first time in so many years.
 His complexion was clear and his eyes were the bright blue they once were and the whites of his eyes were shinny and clear.
 Brandon could hardly wait for us to open the car door and he embraced each of us as if he hadn’t seen us in years.
 I know I hadn’t seen him like this in years.
 He held me so tightly and so long.
 He hadn’t hugged me like that since he was a young child.
 Our son shared a 12 by 12 foot room and one bathroom with 3 people.

 "Of course.

Alec was gone.
 The drapes were swaying gently as if they'd been brushed by someone moving quickly, but other than that there was no trace of him.
 It wasn't until I'd filed out into the grand foyer, eager to spend a few minutes taking in the gorgeous bronze statues liberally scattered throughout the room, that I realized why I felt so odd.
 Part of the difference was the normal sensation of having vicariously been part of something larger than life.
 My head knew all I'd done was sit motionless while performers portrayed a fictional story.
 The rest of me felt as though I had just risked life and limb, seen people I loved killed, and played a small but tangible part in altering the course of history.
 Returning to my mundane, ever so boring life was an incredible letdown, but that didn't explain the hollow sensation that'd lodged itself somewhere between my heart and stomach.
 Illogical as it sounded, the only explanation for feeling as though a part of me had been ripped out and lost was Alec's having disappeared sometime between the last note and the final bow.
 It was unsettling.
 Even my growing feelings for Brandon didn't hint at that kind of need.

 Art – Maybe he will, and maybe the sun will fall from the sky and strike me dead.
 Jim – You can always hope.
 Art – I’m not that gullible.
 Jim – You play the lottery still don’t you?
 You’ve more chance of both having the sun fall on you, and Johnny becoming the ideal prodigy child than you have of winning the lottery.
 Art – Yes, but playing the lottery is my choice, I may not have a snow-ball’s chance in hell of winning, but I don’t have to play either.
 Now I don’t have very little control over Johnny, I wish I did, but I don’t.
 The only thing Johnny’s shaping up holds in common with winning the lottery is that the chances are slim and all I’ll ever be able to do is fantasize about it.
 Jim – If only you did win the lotto, then you could buy a nice tropical island somewhere and send Johnny to it.

When she found herself at the edge of it, she veered right, seeing that it extended farther in that direction.
 She deliberately tried to lose herself, since that was how she'd gotten to 2011.
 And she knew that Rick would find her if she didn't get back to 1927.
 It wasn't working.
 She could tell--there wasn't enough fog to hide anything, and she could see that nothing had changed.
 She was still in 2011.
 "Rick!"
 She could hear him hurrying toward her, and she turned to meet him.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart," he said, hugging her close.
 Tears rolled down her cheeks, and she choked back a sob.

In 1990, the world average was 13.5 per cent of total government expenditure, or 4.8 per cent of GNP.
 More than one-third of the countries in the world still spend more on the military than on education.
 Efforts to improve education must go hand in hand with efforts to promote peace and disarmament and drastically curtail military spending.
 Mechanisms should be put in place to insure that a significant portion of reduced military spending is invested in education and training.
 The very highest social priority should be given to six educational goals in both developing and developed countries.
 First, there must be a massive effort to achieve UNESCO’s goal of eradicating illiteracy worldwide by the year 2000.
 The problem can only be banished by an all-out commitment of every national government to eliminate the huge backlog of illiteracy, while at the same time insuring that every child is taught to read and write.
 National youth service corps and military personnel can be utilized to help provide the necessary manpower.
 Second, every possible step must be taken to provide education for female children, an essential requirement for social equity and quality of life improvement.
 Nearly two-thirds of the world’s illiterate are women.

Kill if needed.
 When you find King Vaelor, wound him but do not kill him.
 Do not be captured, either.
 Die in combat.”
 Ahrqur nodded, his eyes seething.
 Velixar reached out and placed his hand on the elf’s forehead.
 Qurrah watched as smoke rose from their contact, yet neither flinched.
 When the necromancer drew back his hand, a strange symbol lay overtop the faint scarring of the slanted Y.
 It was of a fallen man wreathed in flame.
 “When you fall, the enchantment upon your forehead shall burn your body to ash.

Or Dickens’ Tale of Two Cities, in which Sydney Carton goes to the guillotine as a willing sacrifice for people he loves.
 Or Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, about a fellow who, deep in an African jungle, encounters the hellish depravity of human nature, and assumes it as his own.
 Eric listened to me as long as I wanted to talk.
 But he didn’t care to talk much himself, except about how this expulsion had transformed him.
 He was learning what it meant to work full days, to budget money, and generally act responsible.
 He meant to enroll in adult school and complete his senior year that way, meanwhile saving all he could toward the date of his graduation when he would go looking for some kind of apprentice white-collar job, maybe in another town.
 Probably San Francisco.
 Unless he got drafted.
 The way he talked was eerie and distressing, as if he meant to leave tomorrow and probably never come home.
 On his more effusive evenings, he might offer advice and wrest promises out of me.

Before I’d moved an inch I was back down.
 My pulse pounded in my temples as I struggled to recall what had happened the night before.
 I hissed out a low oath when I remembered Ruby leaning toward me, blowing her glitter in my face.
 My eyes opened again to find Chevelle offering me a glass.
 I winced, unsure of what exactly I had said to him.
 I knew it was bad, but couldn’t quite piece it back together.
 I glanced up at him timidly.
 “Thank you,” I croaked as I took the cup, my hand trembling.
 “Shouldn’t have left you alone,” he said quietly.
 There was a tinkling laugh in the front room and I groaned.

Human development strategies focus on improving the welfare and capacities of the individual through better health, education, political choice and economic opportunity.
 Together they encompass the two basic components of all development personal and institutional, individual and collective.
 The challenge is to develop simultaneously both individual and social capacities and utilize their potentials in a complementary manner.
 For the individual, development involves acquisition of greater know ledge, more progressive attitudes, improved skills and higher values.
 For the collective, development involves establishment of more useful and productive institutions, systems, organizations and cultural values.
 The conventional view that development is essentially a function of scarce economic inputs must give way to the perception that the opportunities and potentials for rapid development far exceed actual achievements in every country.
 Looking back over the past few decades, we realize that the speed of social progress could certainly have been much greater than it was.
 The tremendous potential for accelerating development is most easily illustrated by in stances in which actual achievements substantially excelled expectations, such as the enormous leap in world agriculture during the 1960s and 1970s and the phenomenal growth of incomes, employment and exports in East Asia during the last ten years.
 These unforeseen accomplishments reflect the magnitude of potentials that these countries possessed but had not previously utilized.
 The untapped resources of the society can be categorized under several headings:

She seemed to have recovered, Rick mused as he watched her try on white sandals half an hour later.
 He never would have believed he could enjoy shopping, but he loved watching her discover new styles and new toys.
 He'd bought her a pocket calculator on the way to the shoe store.
 They were going to Teri's for dinner the next evening, and Marie showered and put on her new white dress and sandals when they got back from the shore.
 "How do I look?"
 she asked Rick when she joined him downstairs.
 "Beautiful."
 She was even darker than she'd been yesterday when she'd tried on the dress, and the contrast the dress made with her hair and skin was striking.
 "I can see where you two have been," Teri said when they arrived at her townhouse.
 "Yeah.

He clutched his bleeding side and breathed deeply.
 His armor had saved him, but the elf had managed to penetrate deeper than he thought.
 “Are you fine, Harruq?” Qurrah asked, glancing back and halting his walk.
 “I’m coming,” he said, marching after his brother.
 He hid his pain well.
 The alley opened up to the main street, running south from the center of town into the forest beyond.
 It was there that the bulk of combat had spread.
 Elves battled in the street, horribly outnumbered.
 They were skilled, though, and a steady stream of arrows from homes continued to weaken the human forces.
 “Halt here,” Qurrah said.

A woman would love having that garden, but what did a man know about flowers?
 Truthfully, he knew very little, Rick mused as he set his cartons of Chinese on the counter and went to change clothes.
 He just knew that he enjoyed their beauty and scent.
 But he could never admit that to Lauri; she'd accuse him of being a romantic.
 He really was, deep down, he supposed.
 But he'd had so many bad experiences that he was rapidly becoming something of a cynic.
 He'd thought he'd been in love with Sabrina, but she'd been too demure, too clingy.
 He'd begun feeling smothered.
 Gina had talked of nothing but marriage from their fifth or sixth date until he'd broken up with her.
 She'd sobbed and told him over and over how much she loved him and begged him not to break up with her.

Well, except when we were watching TV, and even then your questions helped me to get to know you."
 She laid her head on his shoulder, pleased but confused.
 Rick was so different from Davis.
 She wished that she could talk about him with her mother.
 But when she could again talk with her mother, there'd be no point.
 Rick would be gone.
 That thought brought tears to her eyes, and she snuggled closer to him, wishing she could have everyone she cared about in the same decade.
 They spent the afternoon watching TV, reading, and napping.
 "I feel so lazy," Marie said, stretching as she yawned.
 "It's nice to have a day like this every now and then, though."

“What is your name?” he asked.
 “Rodregas,” he grunted.
 The knight waited expecting more, but he stopped there.
 He finally shrugged and wrote his name on the scroll in front of him.
 Rodregas’ heart froze as the sorcerer stood and strode over to the table.
 He reached out and casually touched the shoulder of the Knight Captain.
 “Captain Intreg, do you mind asking a few questions to confirm his status?” The Knight seemed uncomfortable under the hand of the sorcerer but nodded and said to Rodregas, “What is the eighth law of Chivalry?” “Thou shalt never offer combat to someone who is not equal in strength, unless in defense of the honor of the Order, for Justice for the oppressed or in defense of the weak,” he answered.
 Captain Intreg nodded and then asked, “A question of law: two messenger couriers stop at a keep with priority messages and switch out horses.
 The local lord finds that both horses are lame and are no longer any good.
 One of the messengers is from a neighboring lord and one from the Guild of the Celestial Path.

“Well?” I was speechless, mouth agape.
 The thing seemed as large and black as a starless night.
 Steed was pleased with my reaction, but Chevelle’s eyes rolled heavenward.
 He didn’t comment, though, simply holding out a hand to help me mount before swinging onto his own.
 “I will ride with you as far north as Naraguah and then make my way east to trade with the imps at Bray,” Steed told Chevelle.
 I swung a shocked look at my watcher, who simply nodded.
 Steed saw my confusion and gave a disapproving glance in Chevelle’s direction.
 He sat straighter, leaving me alone with Chevelle as rider and horse shot past us, a long black tail whipping in their wake.
 I stared at Chevelle.
 “North?” He looked back at me, his calm a contradiction to the thundering beat of my heart.

Then he told me that he would let us use his cave because he was on our side.
 Then I thanked him and here we are, inside the cave nice and dry.” “Maybe that's your power, you can speak to dragons,” Seth suggested.
 “But I don't understand how you two get powers and we don't.” “Be patient,” I said.
 “Yes,” Emily murmured and stifled a yawn.
 “Girls first, Seth.
 Have a problem with that?” “All right then,” he said and leaned against the wall.
 “Sweet dreams to you two.” “Yup sweet dreams to us,” I said and closed my eyes.
 “Goodnight Emily.” “Goodnight Jazell.” I drifted off, feeling surprising comfy against Seth's shoulder and hearing Jason softy snore.
 I opened my eyes to see myself standing in the woods.
 The sky saw clearer and it wasn't raining anymore.

You were just looking for an excuse to get out of class once all of the hero worship dried up.
 Well I got you out and you helped me avoid all of the stupid questions everyone would've asked, so we're even."
 There was another flicker of something I couldn't quite read in Alec's eyes, but I was long past caring.
 I turned and limped off, wishing my ankle was in better shape so I could properly stomp.
 Spanish arrived much too soon.
 Since I hadn't gotten in trouble wandering the halls so far, it was a definite temptation to skip the last hour of school too.
 Unfortunately my luck was bound to give out sooner or later, and then I'd be in even more trouble.
 The last thing I needed was a record of delinquency to go along with my failing grade in Biology.
 Mrs. Tiggs was positively glowing as we all walked into her classroom.
 She popped out of her chair as soon as the bell rang, and began handing out graded tests.

He wasn't sure this trip was such a good idea after all.
 Sharing her dream was going to make him fall even more deeply in love with her.
 And when she left, he'd be devastated.
 But remembering the excitement on her face as she'd danced with the actor, he couldn't regret it.
 The next day they went to Universal Studios.
 "This is set up like an amusement park," Rick told her as he bought their tickets.
 "So even if it isn't authentic, I think you'll enjoy it."
 "I know I will."
 In reality, she wasn't sure.
 The term "amusement park" conjured up visions of carousels and ferris wheels.

I felt fine except for the fact it hurt to stretch my left side.
 I would probably be extremely stiff and sore tomorrow morning, but I was used to that feeling.
 We began to walk back towards the park when Jason stopped us.
 “Hey can Seth and I catch you guys later?
 We have something to do.” Jason grabbed Seth and they took off.
 Emily raised an eyebrow, “Should we be concerned?” “Nah they’re boys, let them do what they have to do,” I said with a quick sigh.
 While we were walking the boys appeared in front of us, holding something behind their backs.
 They seemed to be fighting giggles which usually meant they were hiding something.
 Or they were about to do something that fell under their category of “funny”.
 “Hi guys,” Seth said still fighting a smirk.

BG:  	Have we already talked about this?
 Why does this sound familiar?
 Maybe I’m deja vuing.
 Anyway, I do it both ways.
 Sometimes the lyrics come out, you know, like a poem, when I’m shaving or in the bath.
 Or first thing in the morning, you have to jump from bed and scribble them down.
 Like the phrase “Her glances could break arms.”  I just woke up with that, you know.
 Those are gifts.
 I don’t know where they come from.
 It’s that old question, whether, you know, writing comes from experience or from, like, some deeper place that you tap into, something mythical, the collective Jung-thing.

In the research, analysis, debate, consensus-building and actual operational activities of the United Nations System, the issues of peace, develop ment and democratization have been at the forefront.
 The Members of the International Commission on Peace and Food have interacted closely with the United Nations Funds, Programmes and Specialized Agencies.
 This report brings together many of the issues which are central to the reflection on development which the United Nations is trying to encourage, leading to the World Summit on Social Development to be held in 1995.
 Boutros Boutros-Ghali Secretary General United Nations
 The report of the International Commission on Peace and Food focuses on the 'uncommon opportunities' that have arisen as the world shifts into new alignments.
 These include the chance to tackle the problems of hunger and injustice at the root of so many of the global challenges confronting us not the least, the overriding challenge of nurturing a worldwide culture of peace.
 The Commission has put people first, recognizing that the greatest potential for change is within us, that with education and information we can mobilize the vast amounts of energy and skill which are currently wasted in the scramble for survival.
 It, nevertheless, also accepts that there are no easy solutions and that concerted action is necessary on many fronts in order to untangle the tortuous connections between, for instance, defence spending and food security, for no country can truly be said to be at peace while the violence of hunger blights the life of its citizens.
 ICPF has no hesitation in putting forward ideas that are bound to unsettle, and it should be encouraged since imagination and daring are precisely what we need at the present time.
 Its calls for a standing world army, for the recognition of full employment as a fundamental right and for the elimination of protectionist trade policies to mention but a few examples will cause some sharp intakes of breath among world leaders.

Harruq began his story.
 He told her of a gift from his brother, a tiny sword Qurrah had whittled from bone.
 A bully had stolen it, but then Qurrah used a dead rat under his control to steal it back while they slept.
 The haircut and the story ended at the same time.
 Dirty hair was strewn over the grass.
 “Never had much,” Harruq said.
 “That bone sword was my only possession.
 Still had to hide it because of that bully.
 You know, it’s probably still there, buried underneath our home.”
 “You and your brother had such rough beginnings,” Aurelia said, tucking away the dagger.

That is a hard way to learn.
 The symbols and geometric figures that form a powerful spell are often too complex to learn from just the spoken word.” Rodregas cut in and clarified, “I mean, in the order we did read books on magic theory and history, but I never felt energy from them before.” Imeralda nodded, “Let me explain.
 First, you have a lot more power now, and power calls to power.
 So, you are a lot more sensitive to the power that the books have.
 But what separates Grimoires from other books is that they are made like the stone walls of these buildings, by Nymphs.
 It is thought that the original reason was simply to have books that would not rot over a period of centuries, but the nymph-created paper and leather can hold a faint imprint of magic.
 “Each time that the sorcerers cast a spell from the book, it lightly engraved the pattern into the paige.
 A mage can sense the previous patterns in the book.
 The ability of such books to show the pattern of the spell means that even a mage who knows a spell by heart can cast it faster by using such a book.
 It also means that such books are much sought after and never given up freely.

I was suddenly furious.
 She’d poisoned me and now this.
 I wanted to burn her right then and there.
 I caught Chevelle’s expression as I glared at her.
 He had seen what she was doing, knew her motives most likely, but I could tell he thought it had worked.
 He thought I was jealous.
 Perfect.
 I smelled something odd and glanced down.
 The meat I was holding had burnt in my hand.
 I cursed, dropping it onto the plate.

"No."
 She stood and went to him.
 "I want to go home--" "I know, sweetheart."
 He caressed her hair, wishing he knew how to comfort her.
 "I want to go home, but I also want to go to Hollywood."
 He chuckled.
 "Do you want to cut out the walk in the garden until we get back?"
 "I'm afraid--oh."
 It had just now occurred to her that she wouldn't be able to walk in the garden for the whole week they were gone.
 But she just couldn't pass up the chance to go to Hollywood.

“Exactly,” said Qurrah.
 “But I must practice what I learn.
 These nights are not enough, will never be enough.
 What point is sharpening your sword if you never wield it?”
 Harruq had no reply.
 Eyes low, he stepped out into the night, Aurelia trailing not far behind.
 They travelled deeper into the town.
 A knot grew in her stomach as she noticed he had both his swords, and as they approached the poorer parts of the town, the knot only tightened.
 She watched the half-orc glance in through the windows of the buildings he passed.
 She found herself praying he only meant to steal possessions…‌just possessions, nothing more.

“No.” My breath caught and I forced myself to look at him, still edgy from the closeness the moment before.
 I convinced myself I was imagining the way he studied me as he sat against the downed tree.
 He had no idea what I was thinking.
 It was the furthest thing from his mind.
 “No?” I asked, unable to mask the tremor in my voice.
 “Magic first.” That wasn’t exactly a relief.
 It was obvious he saw my anxiety, but I couldn’t be sure he wasn’t enjoying it.
 He just remained sitting there.
 “What should I do?” A sly grin crossed his face and he rolled his hand out in front of him.
 “You are only limited by your imagination, Freya.” Great, so if I screwed up it was just a problem with my mind.

I must have been speaking or cursing.
 I could hear the sound, but could not make sense of it.
 Nothing made sense.
 I was standing before I knew I was surrounded.
 Fury and fire swam in my head, my chest, my hands.
 I heard them through the buzz.
 “Frey, what’s wrong?
 What is it?
 Frey… Frey.” And then, clearer, “Elfreda!” My jaw tightened, my teeth ground together.
 Comprehension crossed Chevelle’s face as he saw the book on the ground between us.

We even told our children that if Uncle Thomas came to our house or ever tried to get them in a car that they were to run to any other adult.
 We did not know what drug he was on or how far he would go.
 When he moved to southern California, we were not faced with Thomas’s problems anymore.
 I crossed him off of my list—the brother who had stood shoulder to shoulder with me through all the moves, the abuse, and so much else.
 The brother who for a while was all I had was completely estranged from me.
 I had put Thomas in a similar category as my biological Father, Richard.
 I considered that in both of their cases, nothing good seemed to happen when I associated with them so I just kept them out of my life and my family’s as well.
 The latest stories I had heard about Thomas were that while at one point he had escalated his abuse to injecting heroin, he then attended a drug rehab center called Narconon, which had apparently enabled him to be clean for the last couple of years.
 If this was true, and he was clean, maybe he’d be a good person to go to for help?
 My mother thought so, and she insisted that we reach out to him.

I knew all the words, but they wouldn't string themselves together in a way that had any meaning.
 I nodded anyway, and then put my book in my bag, which had somehow made it into her hands.
 She was holding it open as if expecting me to fill it.
 I found myself outside the school, sitting on the edge of the parking lot without a clear idea how I'd ended up there.
 There was a vaguely irritating noise behind me that didn't seem to fit with what I expected from school.
 I thought about turning to see what it was, but was thankfully too far back into the gauze to act on the thought.
 I went back to contemplating the pair of ants that were currently trekking across my right foot.
 "Adriana.
 Are you okay?"
 My insides were too raw.

Or his property.
 “Frey,” Chevelle said, “this is Anvil.” He nodded toward a giant of a man who bowed his head respectfully.
 “And Grey.” The wiry man bent and straightened, his movements too quick.
 I drew in a startled breath as two more figures came into view.
 A pair of slender elves stepped in sync as they stopped just outside the group.
 They were tall and lean, dressed in robes the color of ash that only accentuated their shocking silver hair.
 I was convinced the moonlight must have been exaggerating it.
 And then I jumped again as, on either side of them, two beasts walked forward to stand just in front of the twinned elves.
 Steed brushed an arm against mine, mumbling under his breath, “Yeah, they’re not from around here.” I felt myself leaning on Chevelle for support.
 “Rhys and Rider Strong,” he said from behind me.

“Come brother, the night is waning fast,” Qurrah said.
 Harruq shifted the body to a more comfortable position.
 “Lead the way.”
 The two slipped out the front door and into the night.
 Upon arriving home, Harruq tossed the body into the far room, stripped off his gorgeous black armor, and plopped down onto the bed.
 “Night, Qurrah,” he said.
 “Sorry, but that elfie wore me out, and I never thought cleaning a place could be so tiring.
 I need to rest.”
 “Good night, then,” Qurrah replied, crawling onto his side of the uncomfortable bed.
 He curled his rags about him and drifted off to sleep, pleasant memories of the battle looping in his mind.

Once Rodregas had turned around from the lion, Doi’van started to walk between the pedestals joining Imeralda at looking around.
 He stood in front of the great six-legged stallion, the kind of steed the Gods themselves ride, and then walked over to the Great White Stag of the forest and then to the giant eagle that guarded the Celestial sky.
 It was a sight to take the breath from any mortal, a score of beasts that appeared to have been taken right from the heavens.
 “How were the greater sigils created?” Rodregas wondered.
 While the leaser sigils appeared to be simple sculpture empowered by magic, these truly appeared real.
 Yet what magic could capture such powerful beasts for the use of creating sigils?
 Had the greater sigils been gifts to mortals from the Gods themselves?
 Rodregas yearned to reach out and touch to see if they felt like flesh or stone.
 But, to do so would set his path for the rest of his life.
 If he was truly strong enough for two as Imeralda thought, then he could be a lion and what else?

“Over the centuries, I have gathered many items to aid those who would swear their lives to me,” Velixar said.
 The locks clicked open, the lid raised, and then he reached inside and pulled out two swords sheathed in gleaming obsidian.
 “These swords were once wielded by Aerland Shen.
 He led the elves that aided Karak in the great war against Ashhur.
 When Celestia cursed his kind, they shared his curse.” Velixar smiled at Harruq, his eyes gleaming.
 “Long have I waited for someone to wield these blades.
 An elf crafted and used them in battle, an elf cursed into an orc.
 These swords can only be held by one who has the blood of both inside him.” Velixar held the hilts out to Harruq, who drew one from its sheath.
 The sword’s blade was deep black and wreathed in a soft red glow.
 He weaved it through the air, his mouth agape at the ease in which it glided.

"I seem to be lost.
 Can you point me in the direction of the large white house with four columns that faces Meadows Street?” Rick stared at the girl.
 If he didn’t know better .

 no, that was silly.
 Marie pressed her lips together, looking away from his stare.
 “Can you help me, sir?” “Ummm, Meadows Street?”  She was wearing a drop-waist dress in an odd design, and her hair was curled tight at the ends and flattened.
 “Yes.
 Do you know the house?” “No.

 Your mom might not have been the greatest mother in the world, but she never hit you.
 She took me in, and treated me better than my father ever did.
 I don’t know.
 I’ve been trying not to think about it too much if I can help it, it’s just that all things considered I don’t have much choice not to think about it do I?

Much like he'd done when we'd been fleeing from my house, Alec picked me up and then slung me around so I could wrap my legs around his waist, and my arms around his neck and chest.
 This time Alec wasn't sprinting, but he still set out at a pace that made conversation impossible, so I just relaxed into him and enjoyed being so close for a second time today.
 Once we stopped, I slid down Alec's back and looked around.
 The tiny cabin set back into the rocks before us blended into the hillside so well, I probably wouldn't have noticed it if Alec hadn't stopped so close.
 As soon as he was confident I could stand unaided, Alec gave me a reassuring smile, and then knocked gently on the door.
 The woman who appeared a few seconds later seemed frail in a way that somehow wasn't attributable to her graying hair, or slender frame.
 It wasn't until she released Alec from a hug, and slowly moved back into the cabin, that I realized it was how she moved that made her seem so old.
 Her motions reminded me of how my grandfather had moved the last few years before he'd died.
 Slowly, and with extra care, as if a careless action would leave him crumpled on the floor, racked with pain.
 "Mallory, I'd like to introduce you to Adriana Paige.

“Saurrien was my mentor, Quirren was his mentor, and Bitress was his, Chapter of the Silver Mace,” Rodregas answered.
 The Knight nodded, the answer matched the pattern on the patch.
 “What is your name?” he asked.
 “Rodregas,” he grunted.
 The knight waited expecting more, but he stopped there.
 He finally shrugged and wrote his name on the scroll in front of him.
 Rodregas’ heart froze as the sorcerer stood and strode over to the table.
 He reached out and casually touched the shoulder of the Knight Captain.
 “Captain Intreg, do you mind asking a few questions to confirm his status?” The Knight seemed uncomfortable under the hand of the sorcerer but nodded and said to Rodregas, “What is the eighth law of Chivalry?” “Thou shalt never offer combat to someone who is not equal in strength, unless in defense of the honor of the Order, for Justice for the oppressed or in defense of the weak,” he answered.

I think I just sort of leaned in to kiss her.
 And she let me kiss her, but, man, nothing back.
 I mean, fuck, she didn’t even open her mouth.
 Don’t you hate that shit?
 So, I’m standing there, I might as well have had my dick out, and she looked at me like I was a piece of modern art that she couldn’t figure out.
 And, finally, after I had already turned back into an awkward 12 year old, she said, sorry, I can’t be doing that.
 That was it.
 That was her explanation.
 I never saw that chick again, I can tell you.
 I mean, I got out of there fast and tried to restabilize my pride, and I just thought, well, fuck it, I don’t know what that was all about, I don’t pretend to understand what that was all about.

We will lay waste to all life and put absolute order upon every last soul.”
 “Teach me,” Qurrah said, his mouth buried into the dirt.
 “Show me the power I have sought for so very long.”
 Velixar looked down at his thin, ragged apprentice.
 “Rise.
 Let us begin.”
 Velixar taught until the stars retreated from the obnoxious sun.
 Qurrah returned home, his eyes sagging and his mind exhausted.
 When he climbed into bed, he fell asleep instantly.
 Not long after, Harruq rose, took his swords, and left for his own meeting.

I hadn’t found my body yet, but I heard conversations, voices I knew.
 They were whispers but they were clear.
 I listened, hoping to gain clarity… but something was still wrong.
 Nothing fit.
 They discussed Junnie and Anvil and Fannie, but those all felt like two sets of people now.
 They were worried; I could hear the stress in their tones.
 How long had I been like this?
 It seemed so long, trapped here.
 I remembered the vines.
 I tried to feel my arms, see if they were still there.

His pelvic bones stuck out reminiscent of a dead animal’s carcass on the roadside.
 He looked like one of the horrid pictures you see of a concentration camp victim.
 Oxy is considered synthetic heroin, and sometimes referred to as “hillbilly heroin,” as powerful and addictive a drug as you will find anywhere on the street.
 Children, however, never learn from their parent’s I-told-you-sos.
 He was like a sick animal and we just tried to keep fluids in him and listen to the doctors who guided our effort.
 After the initial detox period, we used professional grade drug tests and surprised him with them.
 He always had an excuse for why he couldn’t pee.
 I would hand him a bottle of water and tell him I would wait.
 He was never truly clean.
 When he slept, I went into the bedroom to see if his chest was inflating with air to assure me he was still alive.

She said her friend was reluctant to come to where I was because I was in a county where they were tough on crime and she wanted me to drive a couple of miles away and meet them at a grocery store.
 I told her again that I didn’t have much time and it was already past twenty minutes.
 The deal would happen where I was or it wouldn’t happen, period!
 I told her to get her shit together or I was leaving.
 I was short, irritated and aggressive as an act to get them to come to me.
 Ashley said she would talk to her boyfriend and call me right back.
 Another call from the officer telling me I was doing fine and to hang in there and hold my position.
 A call from Ashley followed and she stated that her boyfriend was unwilling to come to me so either I meet them at their chosen destination or the deal was off.
 I told her to forget the deal and I would sell the drugs through my friend who I mentioned during the massage if she couldn’t get the boyfriend calmed down.
 Ashley said she would work on him but that tonight was off.

She was all dark, wavy hair, olive skin and at five-three hadn't been able to kiss Dad unless he bent down.
 Dad was the one who gave us the blond hair and a shot at maybe hitting an average height.
 I could see his handsome face smiling at me now, trying to coax me up into the tree with Cindi.
 The vision lasted only as long as it took me to hit the floor.
 I could always judge how long I'd been out by my mom's expression when I came to.
 That and whether or not I'd seriously injured myself on the way down.
 She looked concerned, but not desperate yet.
 Her cell phone was in her hand, but not yet flipped open.
 It probably hadn't been more than eight or nine minutes.
 "Adri, what just happened?"

Jimi and Janis, they did it early so we could keep playing.
 Why I left the electric stuff behind partly.
 CM:  	Really.
 Why?
 BG:  	Well, I mean, he did it all, he took it to the edge and then when the edge laughed at him he laughed back, man, and he went over.
 And he fucking took it with him.
 It’s disrespectful in a way to continue in that vein.
 CM:  	So you went softer, acoustic?
 BG:  	Careful saying “softer,” man.
 To players it sounds too much like “weaker,” you dig?

 [section break](break.png)
 “You’re late,” Aurelia said, stepping out from behind a tree.
 Harruq shrugged and held out two branches he had whittled into crude imitations of swords.
 “Had to make something for me to spar you with,” he said.
 “Those sticks are unnecessary,” Aurelia said as she took up her staff, the tiniest hint of a smile curling on her lips.
 “Draw your swords.”
 “Are you sure?” Harruq asked, raising an eyebrow and gesturing to her completely unarmored figure.

"You've lived somewhere else, somewhere bigger?"
 The wistfulness was gone; the smile was back full force.
 "Not really.
 I've visited a few larger cities, but never for long enough to get the full feel for what it must be like to live in a Minneapolis or a New York.
 Someday maybe though."
 This time I was going to pry, but he preempted my question.
 "It looks like we'd better be going or we'll both be late."
 Les Misérables.
 I managed to put the impending drawing more or less out of my mind for the first half of the day, but I actually missed Britney's constant gossip.
 There was almost no redeeming value to most of what she said, but it did have the benefit of being distracting.

"Mmm."
 Her hand slid to the nape of his neck, gently pulling his head closer.
 He kissed her again, enjoying the sweet warmth of her lips, the eagerness of her response.
 He felt her slender fingers stroking his neck, and remembering how she'd run her hands over his chest yesterday evening, he wished he'd taken off his shirt.
 Marie sighed into Rick's mouth.
 This was better than any fantasy.
 Rick was .

I didn’t have the first idea how to make a bow, let alone shoot one, and I’d never killed anything.
 Except plants.
 And a bird.
 But I had no idea if an animal killed by magic was edible.
 I thought of the thistle, its black roots, how it had turned to ash.
 The rabbit sniffed at the air in my direction and continued on its way, answering the matter for me.
 I was sitting in a hole, utterly alone, and it was beginning to get dark.
 Night bugs chittered, their high-pitched keens rising with the loss of light.
 I lit a thin flame to practice fire magic, leaning forward as I danced it back and forth above the ground.
 My control had progressed a good deal since my training had begun; it seemed almost easy to navigate a small flame.

While the sword should be fine for his first match, he hoped to be fighting all day today.
 He went forward leading with his round shield.
 He pushed his combatant back with some hard swings.
 Rodregas swung his shield aggressively, he hit the man’s sword with his shield and then banged the other man’s shield hard.
 Rodregas’ goal was to see if he could out muscle the man while staying protected by the shield.
 It worked!
 Clearly his opponent, though set for a heavy blow, was not expecting the strength of Rodregas’ bash.
 Still his opponent was too good to fall, even when surprised.
 And even as he half fell backwards he used the momentum to slide down and try to land a blow low under the shield.
 Rodregas had both quickness and strength on his side.

A better understanding of that process will enable us to avoid the errors and tardiness of past efforts and accomplish in the next few decades what might otherwise take centuries.
 The world possesses sufficient experience and information to formulate a comprehensive and integrated theory of development as a social process.
 The theory should explain the process by which human society has developed to where it is today, the forces which propel its growth, and the stages of its past and future progress.
 It should be based on the perception that the political, economic and social life of human kind is a single, inseparable whole and, therefore, that comprehensive, total strategies must be applied to resolve our problems, because partial strategies lead to partial solutions which disturb the harmony of the whole, generating unwanted side-effects.
 This knowledge should be utilized to formulate a model of development that is based on the internal dynamics of the process rather than on its external manifestations or extrapolation of future trends from past data.
 This model should become so precise that we can anticipate the impact of peace, more education, greater political freedom, rising social expectations, and high values such as guaranteed employment on the progress of society.
 This conceptual knowledge should enable us to understand and replicate fully the conditions responsible for the post-war achievements of Japan, China’s recent 20 per cent growth rate or Yugoslavia’s remarkable conquest of hyper inflation.
 A comprehensive approach will enable us to anticipate the imbalances and side-effects generated by partial initiatives and to evolve total strategies to avoid them.
 The comprehensive conceptual model needs to be complemented by the development of models for employment, food, education, trade and other fields that go beyond the national or sectoral approach to show the impact of the complex interactions that are key determinants of the development process – for instance, the impact of democracy on agriculture and of increasing agricultural productivity on employment, industrialization and trade, the impact of rising education on democratization, social tolerance for diversity, personal expectations and social stability.
 Once formulated, these conceptual models need to be applied under a variety of conditions to test their validity and demonstrate the value of a comprehensive approach to development.

The transfer of small arms takes place through diverse channels – formal and clandestine trade, legal and black or grey markets, and local manufacture.
 These weapons provide the means to support and sustain low-intensity (but highly lethal) conflict.
 The contemporary international scene is replete with examples – Peru, Central America, Northern Ireland, Bosnia, the Caucasus, Angola, South Africa, Somalia, the Middle East, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Kashmir, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and so on.
 Recently, they have been used more widely to support ethnic conflicts around the world.
 These weapons are often targeted against the society itself.
 The high rate of violence in Washington DC and other American cities, and the internecine conflicts of the Mafia and other criminal operations, all depend on the use of these deadly weapons, of which there are more than 200 million in the United States alone.
 Coping with this threat is made more difficult because, more often than not, such weapons in the hands of non-state actors, especially militants and terrorists, are superior to those available to security forces and law enforcement agencies of the state, and because detection and control of their distribution pose serious problems.
 No serious efforts are being made to stop this cancerous proliferation.
 In fact, many states have actively fostered proliferation as an instrument of their own policies.
 One of the most serious consequences of this trend is the linkage between small arms proliferation and the drugs trade.

"So did I.
 But I hurried--I couldn't wait to get home."
 He smiled at her.
 "We need to add a bathrobe to our shopping list, don't we?"
 She was wearing his, obviously having just showered.
 "No.
 I like wearing yours."
 "Do you want to run and get dressed before we eat?"
 "No.
 I want to know what the surprise is."

Who is God.
 Revising
 While I’m writing all this from notes and memory, I decide to pick up my old hardback of Big Sur.
 I still get moved by Jack Kerouac’s honesty and his pictures of the raw and terrifying beauty of people and things.
 After reading about a drive from Big Sur into Monterrey, I go online and look up pictures of the two real people (to whom the book gives other names) on that drive, Kerouac and Neal Cassady.
 Both men were remarkably handsome, some of God’s finest art, I think.
 Then I remember a character from Ken Kesey’s Sometimes a Great Notion, and I realize that Kesey may have used Neal Cassady, a fellow of wild intellect and passion, and a legendary womanizer, as a prototype for his character Joe Ben.
 Only he revised, changed his life, and made Joe Ben a real hero.
 Remembering that Kesey and Cassady were friends, I look up some dates.
 Sure enough, they met while Kesey was writing that novel, two years before it came out.

Jason saw his blurry outline first and signaled us to enter the Half-way.
 The wind whirled around me, and I walked over to the dwarf with the others.
 The dwarf was breathing heavily, trying to catch his breath.
 All four of us stood there waiting and when he got his breath back, he spoke.
 “I am glad that you accepted my message,” he said to Seth and me.
 Then he turned to Emily and Jason and said, “Ah, it’s great to meet the other two.” He beamed at all four of us.
 “Hi,” Emily said, looking a little freaked out.
 “So now that you’re here, are we going to get a move on or what?” “Oh of course, follow me please.” He shuffled off and disappeared behind the statue.
 Jason raised an eyebrow.
 “Where is he going?” Emily sighed.

You know how to do this, right?
 I’m counting on this being my record, what’s gonna make sense out of something that really doesn’t.
 A man’s life.
 An artist’s life, if I can speak in such terminology.
 Is that what we’re after?
 Ok.  Hell, where was I?
 CM:  	Carlos Santana.
 BG:  	Right.
 A fine guy, a good guy.
 He’s such a gentle man, you know?

Still, his greatness, the character trait that makes me hope someday we’ll find a President like him, is his devotion to do whatever is good and right, though it might be the hardest way.
 A question.
 How, given the world’s need for such people and his belief that his young wife’s gifts will make her a mother able to lavish her child with love and wisdom, could a man who, when a novice parent, helped create and develop two such excellent beings as Darcy and Cody decline to make and help raise one more.
 After the exams, written and oral, Pam got euphoric and believed she couldn’t fail at anything.
 If she wanted to be a mom, she could do it.
 And, she said on account of my kids, it appeared I had good genes.
 So we decided to get to work.
 Mighty pleasant work, which we’re both apparently competent at.
 According to the pre-natal calculations, our little girl--Zoë Ada Fox Kuhlken--got conceived during the week after Pam’s last exam.
 All my adult life, I have worked to support other people.

I’d have to try harder tomorrow, stay on task.
 I ran back to the castle at full speed.
 Ruby cleared her throat and I shoved the book into my pack.
 I glanced over at her but she was still facing out the window.
 A moment later Chevelle walked in and she threw him a wicked grin, leaving us alone.
 I brushed the length of my hair forward, hoping to cover the heat that had risen to burn my neck and ears.
 “Ready to resume training?” he asked.
 That cooled the flush and I grimaced, moving to stand.
 I hadn’t done so since the incident and my head spun.
 I wobbled, and Chevelle was suddenly there, steadying me.

If there'd been any justice in the universe, he'd have somehow gotten uglier over the last few hours.
 That or I'd have developed some kind of partial immunity to him.
 Neither was the case, he was just as unearthly gorgeous as he'd been in the hall.
 The sight of him was almost overwhelming.
 As he slipped into a desk an aisle away from me, I tried to breathe deeply and slowly in a futile effort to calm my racing heart.
 It helped a little when he slid the desk back a few feet.
 As long as I watched Mrs. Alexander I couldn't see Alec anymore.
 It seemed like I could still feel him though.
 The right side of my body hummed and tingled, almost imperceptibly, telling me he was there.
 I did my best to ignore the sensation, concentrating on the pictures rapidly forming on the ancient blackboard as Mrs. Alexander diagrammed the conceptual model of a wave, and started dissecting the various parts.

He isn't here, so possibly they're going down together."
 It'd been a fairly slender thread upon which to hang my hopes.
 Somehow my dream of seeing Les Misérables had morphed into a dream of seeing Les Misérables with Rachel.
 We still didn't get to spend much time together, but she was rapidly becoming the only person I could confide in besides Brandon.
 A boyfriend, or near-boyfriend, was nice, but some things just needed to be shared with another female.
 I couldn't tell my mom about my feelings for Brandon or she'd absolutely freak.
 After spending so much time lying to her about the origin of the almost four dozen roses, I couldn't afford any kind of slip in that regard.
 She'd thought the single rose, Lagrimas del Angel, as I was calling it now, had been sweet and thoughtful, especially when I'd told her it was from an anonymous admirer.
 The other roses had been an entirely different matter.
 I'd had to do some pretty quick talking to convince her I didn't know who they were from either.

I'd had nightmares for months.
 Dreams where the stairs had turned slick and I'd slid all the way down them.
 Dreams where the banister hadn't even been there and the stairs had become impossibly narrow, and nightmares where I'd somehow stumbled and started to fall over the edge of the railing.
 This was like all of those dreams put together, only happening to someone else.
 A couple of kids reached out, but the only people who could've really stopped him had already been bowled over.
 Time slowed down for me as he hit the railing and started over it.
 His feet came up and his torso was hanging in the void when someone reached over and grabbed his arm.
 I heard a grunt of effort, saw him stop moving, and only then realized it was Ben who'd nearly died.
 In the split second between Ben being gently placed back on the stairs, and everyone starting to breathe again, I followed the arm that'd saved him back to see who the hero was.
 Isaac met my gaze as he let go of Ben and then he looked up at Vincent with a stare that was somehow both calm and challenging at the same time.

 You’re not planning to stab my mother are you?
 Jim – No way!

 Liz – Then what’s the knife for?
 Jim – I was planning on stabbing myself, then making my getaway in the ambulance to the hospital.
 Liz – Isn’t that a bit extreme a reaction?
 Just excuse yourself and leave.
 No mess, no pain, and no hurt feelings.
 Jim – I’ve tried that, didn’t work.

Rodregas’ sword blow was too fast for the guard to block and had the strength to stun a guard wearing regulation armor.
 His sword cleaved the guard in half, and a gout of blood and gore splattered him.
 Rodregas pulled his sword free and spun away from the mess.
 As he came to rest the sound of arrows was quiet, part of his mind knew that Imeralda was backing deeper into the forest.
 As he cleared the mess he had made of the last slaver, Rodregas came face to face with an Immortal Guard.
 Behind him were two more slavers.
 The Immortal Guard wore the classic half plate of regulation Immortal Guard armor: A full suit of Mithril chain covered with a breastplate and leg guards and vambraces for the forearms.
 His head was covered with a half helm.
 His Mithril was shining in the sun.
 His breast plate was solid dark Night Bronze.

Protect him, even unto death.
 He will usher in a new age to this world.
 Of this I have no doubt.” He shouted an order to Qurrah’s undead.
 The eight obeyed, marching out of town to join the rest of Velixar’s army.
 “I will take control now,” he said to his disciple.
 “In time, the burden of sustaining life in them will seem weightless.
 Until then, let me bear it.
 Look at me.”
 Qurrah did, his eyes red and his face wet.
 “Yes master?” he asked.

Qurrah looked to the distance.
 He could see a man cloaked in black standing upon a hill.
 Red eyes burned through the blackness within his hood.
 The feeling of absolute power then was greater than Qurrah had ever felt, greater than even the master of his youth._
 Why should I follow?
 _Qurrah heard himself ask.
 Hands stretched to the heavens, the cloaked man laughed.
 His power surged with the laughter, obliterating Qurrah’s ability to stand._
 Because I am eternal, _said the figure._ I sire war.
 I sow bloodshed.

 He grunted, stroking Marie's cheek and then tilting her chin up.
 "We have been out of our minds with fear.
 We had no idea what had happened to you."
 "I know.
 Thinking about how worried you'd be was the worst thing about being gone."
 "Are you all right?
 Are you hurt anywhere?"
 "I'm fine.

He bent to inhale its fragrance.
 She took scissors from a drawer and reached for a lock on the back of her head.
 She snipped one off and handed it to Rick.
 "We should find a ribbon to tie it so that the strands won't come lose."
 He fingered the silky lock.
 This was all he'd have left of her.
 Swallowing, he nodded.
 "I don't have any, but I'll buy one.
 For now I'll put it in a book."
 They went to the living room, and he put it in her copy of The Dragonriders of Pern.

And you’re gonna find that thing, even as it keeps receding from view, even as the more you go forward the farther away it gets.
 You ever been to the beach man?
 Seen those little clams, tiny little fuckers, that dive as you dig around them.
 They just keep burrowing downward, and the faster you dig the deeper they go (is that a Beatle’s line?
 something like that) (laughs).
 Anyway, those little fuckers defy your best efforts, they’re almost always gonna be quicker than you.
 That’s what writing is, man, it just keeps going farther into the sand, the thing you’re looking for, the thing that’ll make it all alright.
 It just stays beyond you, just out of your grasp.
 And that’s how it should be, man, because otherwise why would you keep digging?
 Why keep looking if it’s easy to find?

Fear finally overcoming my desire not to look stupid.
 I started to push away from Brandon.
 My efforts seemed futile for several seconds, and then his right arm released me.
 He wasn't letting me go though, his right hand had just repositioned to my stomach while his left arm kept me pinned against him almost as tightly as both hands had just a second before.
 It should have been obvious what he had in mind, but it wasn't until his hand was under my shirt and moving upwards that my overloaded mind caught up with events.
 I tried to protest, tried harder to push myself away from him, but he just held onto me tighter than even before.
 His hand was just millimeters away from its target, and I was starting to see stars from lack of air, before I finally remembered some of the tricks my dad had shown me.
 I slammed my heel down on his left foot, and then brought my knee upwards towards his crotch, only to hit nothing but air as he spun me around.
 "What the crap are you doing?"
 He wasn't even limping.

 “Wait,” I said suddenly, “weren't you going to tell Emily and Jason about you-know-what?” “What?” Seth asked lazily and plucked at the grass.
 I sat up and glared at him.
 “What do you mean, 'what'?
 You said you were going to tell them!
 I'm going to tell them if you aren't.” I stood up, but Seth was faster.
 He grabbed my arm.
 I stood there and stared at him.
 “Please Jazell, let me tell them myself,” he begged.
 I waited for him to let go, but his grip stayed firm and strong.

Then it was too late; the blue flames of the circle rose high, then inward, and engulfed him.
 The young man started to split in two.
 The physical man stood there, but as he watched, another ethereal version, the man’s spirit, his very non-corporal essence, was suddenly pulled from his body, and then whipped around and out of the burning circle.
 Rodregas was not sure, but as this ethereal version of the man was pulled apart, Rodregas thought he could see him screaming.
 Rodregas pulled his eyes away from the horrifying vision as the corporal man went from looking confused and unsure to having no expression at all, like an empty piece of meat.
 Rodregas’s eyes flinched away from the terrible sight as he felt he might scream in horror and fury at what was happening.
 Then Ravenhurr yelled out, “Spirea faira podia turiana,” and the circle holding the Celestial Lion started to burn in the same blue flames, the blue flames that make up the creation forces of life that can only be called up when the Celestial Realm was close.
 Suddenly the sleeping lion looked up in surprise and started to growl and then he started to burn.
 Rodregas had seen enough of lesser versions of the ritual to expect it, but to watch it was amazing.
 The circle blazed with an intense heat that blasted his face and the magnificent creature inside blazed with blue creation fire.

I would hate it forever, but she would die.”
 The necromancer nodded.
 “Never forget it.
 Now let me help you dress those wounds.
 Some look deeper than you let on.”
 Harruq remained silent as his brother scanned him, tightening bandages and cleaning some of the nastier cuts.
 His mind lingered on the fight that night, blocks he had missed, moves he made he shouldn’t have, and opportunities presented he had not taken advantage of.
 But mostly he thought of Aurelia, giggling as vines held him and she blasted his back with springs of water.
 He did not sleep well that night.
 It would be a long while before he did.

She felt guilty for spying on him, but Aurelia was convinced she had no other choice.
 Over the past month, she had grown close to the half-orc Harruq Tun, and with that closeness was danger.
 She saw only a goofy young man while Dieredon swore she met with a killer.
 Only one of them could be right, but who?
 Perhaps not, she wondered.
 Perhaps she saw the elf in Harruq while Dieredon saw the orc.
 The kindest man might become a brute when surrounded by other brutes.
 When Harruq was with his brother, or the strange man in black, how then did he behave?
 Could he kill?
 Could he murder?

That is ‘The One Law.’” “Why?” asked Doi’van, his deep voice sounding both menacing and curious.
 “Nobody knows for sure,” said Jordaan.
 “The Gods and Infernals do not explain their actions, but most believe that if someone had the full potential to tap into all three… he would be stronger than either the Gods or the Greater Daemons.
 He would have the potential to rule all the realms and break the great balance.
 This is something that not even the Infernals want,” he added.
 Rodregas spoke, “So if Ravenhurr, who was a friend of Taiga, was part of a group of Immortalists who are breaking ‘The One Law’ then he might have already added Hellborn power to his own.
 And when I took on Ravenhurr’s power, I also added the Infernal power, which is natural for a Hellborn.
 It could also be a reason that the gods answered my prayers and helped me succeed against Ravenhurr.” “So the Gods might not be against all Immortalists, but just the ones who are tapping into the Infernal power?” asked Doi’van.
 “All Immortalists deserve to die for their crimes,” Rodregas answered.
 His angry response did not surprise the others.

“Though I did read once that there was a way to steal life force and use it for yourself.” Chevelle shot her a stern rebuke from the front of the pack.
 She continued as if excusing herself, “But it was merely a fairy’s tale and probably not entirely accurate.” Then, in a lower voice, “It is fun to speculate, though.” I wiped at my cheek to clear the dampness from the mist, mirroring her low tone as I questioned her.
 “How would you steal life force?” “Well, like I said, probably not accurate… but you would have to take the other’s life in order to gain their power.
 Take it in a specific manner.” She noticed Chevelle glaring at her and clamped her mouth shut.
 I waited until he turned back around before I whispered, “Ruby, did you bring the magic book with you?” She smiled.
 “Can I read it?” She winked at me.
 I started to share her grin, but before I could, Chevelle was in front of us, his horse blocking my way.
 I was almost thrown from my saddle when we stopped to avoid running into him.
 He was angry again.
 “Frey.” “What?” “Do you remember the last time you used a spell?” I recalled the smell of burning flesh as the maps cut into my palms.

“Mine?” He smiled and swung onto his horse, nodding farewell as he spun and galloped east.
 My horse knelt and Chevelle offered his hand to help me get seated.
 My grin widened as he mounted his horse and he looked back at me questioningly.
 “I’ll name him Steed,” I announced proudly.
 Chevelle pressed his eyes closed, shaking his head as I patted the horse’s neck once more.
 Chapter Eight Mountains
 We rode through the morning hours.
 Chevelle seemed content not to talk, but I was wound up in anguish, trying to decide whether I was brave enough to ask him questions.
 I had no idea how much he would put up with before he called it all off and hauled me back to the village for sentencing.
 Our path became more defined, pushing us through trees and between rocks, trailing upward so minutely I didn’t even realize until I glanced back and saw the base of the mountains beneath us.

Under the communist system, emphasis was placed on education and training in technical subjects with little attention to marketing, organizational, commercial and interpersonal skills, which are essential requirements for functioning in a market economy.
 A detailed inventory should be compiled of the types and levels of skills needed for transition to the market, covering areas such as entrepreneurship, management, national and international marketing, strategic business planning, finance, quality control, product development, production technology, design, and human resource development.
 Intensive training programmes need to be introduced to impart these skills on a massive scale.
 Even in the most advanced industrial nations there is vast scope for upgrading skills to improve productivity and to keep pace with rapid technological development.
 Inadequate skills are a major impediment to the assimilation of new technologies.
 The increasing demands of global competitiveness place pressure on workers in these countries to continuously improve their skills.
 The mismatch between the skills of the workforce and the evolving needs of industry aggravates unemployment.
 Studies of the return on investment from training programmes document the enormous benefits of continuously upgrading the skills of the workforce.
 Private sector investment in training will prove in adequate unless it is encouraged by incentives or complemented by greater public investment in this sector.

It took the sting out of the words that were probably just for the people close enough to overhear.
 "Don't you worry, Miss Paige, I'll let you know when I don't think you're keeping up.
 Seeing as you are done though, would you please run something over to Mrs. North?
 I'd do it, but I need to go to a special projects meeting today during lunch."
 As quickly as that, my books were in my backpack and I was on my way to the second story of the school, which housed music, sketching, and all the other forms of art lesser mortals like me would never master.
 The journey would've been completely unremarkable except that I happened to glance into one of the classrooms just before I found Mrs. North's room.
 Even a brief glance screamed art students.
 There were at least twenty people sitting in front of contraptions that looked like a cross between an easel and a desk, and most of them had the look of intense concentration I'd come to associate with Mom attempting to frame a picture.
 The notable exception was Alec, who I almost didn't recognize.
 I hadn't expected to see him in an art class, but more than that was the way his face seemed transformed.

I was thinking of Noble as I resolved to wear the dress meant for our wedding, with its dramatic shape and deep meaning.
 I remembered when he’d given it to me, explaining the white stood for innocence.
 I had stifled a giggle then.
 I could find no humor now.
 Yes, it would be fitting.
 I knew what was coming.
 But what I had read so far was much more horrifying than I’d expected.
 I didn’t want to continue.
 How could I have been so stupid as to forget it was my mother who had destroyed the northern clans, taken the families from everyone I knew?
 As they stood protecting me, the betrayal I’d felt before was gone.

"Tell me where it is, and I'll get it for you."
 Following his instructions, she went to his bathroom and got the lotion.
 Opening the bottle, she sniffed it as she descended the stairs.
 It didn't smell as good as the sunscreen, so she wasn't tempted to rub any onto her own skin.
 "Thanks, honey--this'll feel great."
 He rubbed some on his legs and then stripped off his shirt.
 Marie watched in fascination as he applied the lotion to his arms and chest.
 When he was finished, she told him, "I'll do your back."
 "Thanks."
 She used both hands, slowly rubbing the lotion over every inch of his back.

I have a few questions for you though before I leave your dried up husks behind for the rats.” Rodregas growled to himself and pulled the only weapon he had, a small dagger, out and threw it hard straight at Van’dret.
 A second dagger flew almost in the same heart beat from Doi’van.
 The sorcerer simply waved in the air and both daggers flew to the side and clattered off the wall.
 The sorcerer smiled, standing tall, and Rodregas had to admit he seemed very relaxed and in control.
 His expensive black and gold robes were perfectly cut, his dark hair was slicked back.
 He might be wearing the body of a twenty year old, but he showed all the self confidence of a man who counted his age in decades if not centuries.
 Van’dret’s voice reflected the articulation and grace of a man who had all the time in the world to enjoy the finer things in life.
 “So let us dispense with the silly games and lies.
 Let me be clear about something.
 You killed Nordien who was a friend of mine.

It might well have been since Mother really didn’t want that one in the show, but it has made a lot of people laugh, and the posters of it are selling well.

 Jim – Woo-hoo!
 I feel special now.
 Liz – You are special.
 Jim – It’s all the paint-chips I ate as a kid, with the right dip they’re pretty good.
 Liz – Sometimes I think you were dropped on your head as a baby, but with a skull that thick I think that you hurt the floor worse than it hurt you.

He looked down at my ankle and then smiled with a hint of mischievousness.
 "I suppose dancing is out, but I think I've got something that'll do just about as well."
 Alec carefully picked me up before I could respond.
 A few seconds later we were outside, traveling through the darkness with a breakneck speed that would've been suicidal with merely human vision.
 I was completely lost by the time we came around a corner and my inferior eyes were finally able to see the first hints of light up ahead.
 Alec slowed, to prolong the suspense as we got closer.
 Even so, it was only a few more steps before the grotto materialized out of the darkness before us.
 I'd thought it'd been breathtaking two weeks ago bathed in the light of the full moon.
 I'd been amazed at its lush beauty the couple of times I'd snuck back during the daylight.
 Neither of those compared to what greeted me now.

It was rare enough to find a school teacher who could really teach math these days, finding a student who could teach was nearly a miracle.
 Rachel packed up her things while I was being instructed in the finer points of inequalities.
 As she slid the last book into her backpack, Albert stepped away from my desk with another smile.
 I flipped over to the next chapter and started in on functions as Rachel exited out a corner door I hadn't noticed before.
 I saw a flash of the stunted, brown vegetation that the locals called grass before the door swung back closed.
 Suppressing an urge to just surrender and go outside until Britney finished up, I got started.
 The roar of some kind of high-performance engine a few seconds later almost changed my mind, but my native stubbornness kicked in before I let the thought get out of hand.
 The subject matter was harder than graphing, but I persevered, and managed to make it through all fifteen problems without resorting to the red side of the card.
 Of course Albert did stop by to see if I was having any difficulties, but since I didn't summon him, he couldn't read anything into it.
 When Britney stomped over and asked if I was done, I considered telling her I needed ten more minutes.

He fell to one knee and vomited a pile of white flesh and maggots.
 “You will suffer,” he gasped.
 “For ages, I will make you suffer.”
 “Try it,” said Dieredon.
 Two more arrows flew, but they halted in mid-air.
 Velixar stood, his hand outstretched, gripping the projectiles with his mind.
 The elf fired two more volleys but all the arrows froze beside the others.
 “Fool,” Velixar hissed.
 At once, the arrows turned and resumed their flight, straight at Dieredon.
 The elf dove, rolling underneath the barrage.

 “Jazell!” Seth yelled, but his voice was muffled by the dirt flying everywhere.
 I grabbed at something, anything, but there was no hold.
 “Seth, where are you?” I thought that he said something but, I couldn't hear him.
 All I could hear was the blood pounding in my ear and my racing heartbeat.
 Dirt fell into my mouth and I coughed, trying to get rid of it.
 My vision was closing, getting dark.

“What are you?” Qurrah asked.
 Velixar laughed.
 “How much do you know of the gods of this world, Qurrah Tun?”
 Qurrah shrugged.
 “I know their names and little else.
 Karak is death, Ashhur is life, and Celestia everything else, if the ramblings of priests and elves is to be believed.”
 Velixar nodded, the fire in his eyes growing.
 “This world is young, Qurrah, and Karak and Ashhur are young gods.
 Only five-hundred years ago they came and gave life to man.” Those eyes twinkled.
 “I was one of the first they made.”

He was lonely.
 Rick sighed, setting down the carton of fried rice and leaning back.
 That was why he’d been foolish enough to ask Kim to marry him, he now realized.
 He was much more cautious now.
 In fact, Ted said he’d gone to the opposite extreme.
 But he’d finally realized that there were worse things than being lonely.
 He wouldn’t have been lonely if he’d married Kim or Gina or Sabrina, but he wouldn’t have been happy.
 Even sex was no longer enough to motivate him to get into a relationship like those.
 He wanted someone he could be completely at ease with.
 He wanted someone he could relax with when he came home from work, not someone he had to work to please.

It is not fully developed in the form of practically useful knowledge.
 An educational system that endows the individual with the capacity for physical accomplishment, psychological fulfilment and original thinking would enable society consciously to abridge the development process and accomplish goals within one or a few decades that would otherwise take place over the span of a century or more.
 We believe that it is possible to fashion a system that directly prepares students for life in the twenty-first century, because the necessary knowledge already exists subconsciously in society and consciously in a few stray individuals or social groups.
 Materially, the world already possesses the knowledge needed to produce sufficient food and other necessities to eradicate poverty from the earth, but this knowledge is not yet a conscious possession of humanity as a whole that is passed on to every individual, even in the most advanced nations.
 Socially, every culture possesses the knowledge of the essential qualities necessary for lasting success.
 This knowledge, if consciously formulated, can be systematically imparted to the entire population through formal education.
 Psychologically, the right attitudes, values and motives enable the individual to attain a self-existent happiness and inner harmony which nothing can disturb.
 This knowledge too can be consciously formulated and communicated through the educational system of the twenty-first century.
 Mentally, our knowledge is partial, biased and largely dependent on social status and opinion, rather than purely rational criteria.
 True mental objectivity can be taught.

I didn't have to pretend to be hurt and disappointed.
 Even knowing that Alec was everything I'd thought Brandon was, I still felt used and disappointed.
 "I just wasn't what he was looking for.
 He made it very clear the last time I saw him."
 Mom crossed the distance from the window and wrapped her arms around me.
 "Teenage boys are so cruel.
 I'm sorry.
 Do you want to go out for ice cream this afternoon?"
 My smile came much easier than it would have if Alec hadn't magically come into my life.
 "That is the time-honored method for dealing with breakups."

He kissed me, which was wonderful at first.
 But then he started kissing me so hard that my teeth cut into my lips, and I tried to push him away, but he wouldn't stop.
 And he put his hand under my skirt to touch my leg.
 I was finally able to push him away, and all he said was to make sure that you told me what my duties would be once we were married."
 Mrs. Tranton's eyes blazed.
 "Your father is going to kill him.
 Marie, no man should treat any woman that way, even his wife.
 Kissing--" "I know.
 And it's because of Rick that I know."

He’d told her he’d lend her the book, but she said that she already had some ideas about finding a drop-waist dress and a cloche hat.

 And he certainly wasn’t going to wear a raccoon coat.

She wasn't in the living room or kitchen.
 He went upstairs and looked in her bedroom.
 Where else could she be?
 "Marie?"
 He finally went out to the garden.
 She was way over by the pink roses, and he was surprised and dismayed to see her wearing her 1927 clothes.
 "Marie!"
 He ran over to her, but something about her stance when she looked up at him kept him from sweeping her into his arms like he wanted.
 "What are you doing?"
 he asked.

As she'd promised when she'd invited them, Teri had made a Chinese meal.
 "House rules: you have to spend at least 15 minutes using chopsticks," she told them as they sat down to dinner.
 "After that, you can have a fork if you want."
 Marie had eaten in Chinese restaurants in 1927, so she managed with the chopsticks.
 The meal was enjoyable, but she couldn't keep her thoughts from wandering to Rick.
 His neck looked so warm and inviting.
 She wanted to bury her face in the crook of his neck and shoulder.
 Did he like being kissed on the neck as much as she did?
 Just the memory of his kisses made her heart race.
 They had coffee and dessert in the living room.

She was right.
 Nearly everyone left over the next little while as they either finished up their assignments, gave up, or finally filled whatever quota of study time they'd been given by their parents.
 I did get to answer a couple of questions, which was surprisingly fun.
 When there was only half an hour left Mrs. Campbell walked over.
 "Good job so far.
 Albert, the other tutors, and I are all going to head out.
 Stay here until closing time, and then you're free to go.
 We'll see you tomorrow."
 I watched as my new co-workers trickled out, and then looked around at the nearly empty room.
 Rachel was still sitting at her desk in the middle of the room, and Britney was still pouting from her new, assigned seat.

Salvation and Condemnation waved high above his head, both drenched in blood.
 He looked like a god among men, and the way the soldiers fell at his feet made him think he might have been one.
 This red-dream self looked straight at him and spoke, but Harruq could not understand the words.
 The sound of his own voice chilled him, though, for it was dark, it was dangerous, and it was exactly like Velixar’s.
 _A god among men,_ said a second voice, one he had never heard before.
 It was darker than any shade that haunted his nightmares.
 There was only one it could be, and it was no mortal.
 _Protect your brother, and I will grant you a kingdom.
 Live as you have always lived, and I will reward you with eternity.
 Kill, as I desire you to kill, and you will find a peace unknown to the mortal realm.

International level
 1.Shift resources from defence to human resource development: Worldwide, massive investment is needed to improve the quantity and quality of education and training.
 A substantial portion of these resources will have to come from reduced military spending.
 But as recent experience illustrates, savings in defence spending will not automatically go to this sector.
 The UN Social Summit should adopt specific goals for reducing military expenditure worldwide and channelling a specific percentage of the savings into education, vocational training, public information and other programmes for development of human resources.
 Each country should set similar goals.
 The Commission recommends that a minimum of 10 per cent of the reductions in defence expenditure be invested in education.
 2.Comprehensive, human-centred theory of development: An important shift in thinking has taken place from regarding development primarily in terms of economic growth to greater emphasis on the human welfare and development of people.
 But development is not only a set of goals or material achievements – it is a social process by which human beings progressively develop their capacities and release their energies for higher levels of material achievement, social and cultural advancement, and psychological fulfilment.
 New theory is needed that focuses on the dynamic role of information, attitudes, social institutions and cultural values in the development process.

Tears sparkled in her eyes.
 "I'm sorry."
 "I know."
 He kissed her then, slowly, sweetly, longingly, trying to memorize the taste and feel of her mouth.
 He wanted to deepen the kiss, to evoke the passion he knew only too well that she was capable of, but such a kiss would be torture for both of them.
 Marie at last ended the kiss.
 She gazed up into his eyes for a moment.
 "I love you, Rick."
 "I love you too, sweetheart."
 Slowly she backed out of his arms.

“Do we leave the bodies here?” Harruq asked.
 The necromancer trotted over to the dead noble and did not answer.
 Instead, he ruffled through the silk robes until he found a scroll marked with the seal of the king.
 Qurrah ripped it to shreds and let the pieces scatter in the wind, then he turned to his brother.
 “Do you remember what our Master wanted?”
 Harruq unsheathed Condemnation and nodded.
 “Aye, I do,” he said.

 When they returned to where Velixar waited, Harruq dropped the head of the noble.

From Van Morrison to Lorelei.
 That’s a story, isn’t it, sweet?
 Um.
 It was at the Shell.
 Black Lung was playing, one of our first headlining gigs, I think.
 I came off stage after the encore, after we’d done a cooking version of “I Love my Aunt Jemima,” Skippy going wild like a man possessed, and maybe he was, man, maybe he was.
 This was Memphis, those things are real, man.
 No one looks askance at a little theurgy, you know, a little of that Memphis Mojo, that hoodoo that brought us everything from W. C. to Isaac to Booker to Big Star to Jism.
 I been playing rock, blues, jazz, ruckus, fife-and-drum, what have you, all my life.

I noticed a bus parked out front, slowly loading with students and staff.
 I asked a staffer where they were going, and was surprised when he told me they were headed to a Catholic church for Easter services.
 I told him I thought this was a Scientology-based program, to which he replied that, while this was a common misconception, they did not favor or push any religion.
 A shame, he stated, as this keeps some people away from a very good rehabilitation center where everyone is allowed to practice whatever religion they wish.
 My wife and I had attended Alanon meetings back home and we found them very religious in structure so we expected some Scientology leanings out here in the desert, but found no evidence of any.
 Our son proudly toured us around the grounds and introduced us to everyone we passed.
 He was so enthusiastic and so different.
 Although he was excited to see us, he was calm and collected.
 He was respectful to all and excited to show off his family, he seemed to know everyone.
 We met many of the people who we spoke with on the phone and got to put their faces with their names.

It was almost convincing.
 If he hadn't mentioned the stairs, and thereby the fight, I might have fallen for it, but he was just looking for more attention.
 "I'll be okay.
 Just a little sprain."
 Alec looked like he wanted to say something else, but finally nodded and sat down in the next chair over.
 It wasn't as good as if he'd gone all the way back to his seat, and it was extremely out of character, but it was better than nothing.
 I breathed a sigh of relief that he wasn't going to continue fishing for compliments, and returned to my drawing.
 I knew I should open my books back up and study, but it was starting to take shape, and I figured it was only a few minutes away from becoming recognizable.
 Once that happened my meager drawing skills would evaporate and I'd have to stop anyways.
 For whatever reason every time I tried to work on something after I realized what it was, I completely ruined it.

“Enjoying the beast?” I smiled in return, but as the horse kept up speed, we started to pass him, and I realized I didn’t know how to slow down.
 I didn’t know how to stop.
 For nuts’ sake, I didn’t know how to ride.
 My head jerked back to find Steed, the exhilaration replaced by fear.
 Recognizing my panic, he let out a short, sharp whistle and the horse slowed at once, falling in beside his.
 Our legs almost touched as the animals loped in tandem.
 “Never ridden?” “No.” My voice was shaky, along with my hands and legs.
 “We only train them with commands for the imps.
 Just use your magic.” I tamped down an image of the horse bursting into flames.
 “I haven’t learned animal magic.” His lip pursed, one brow dropping low, the same strange look he’d given the first time I’d mentioned learning magic.

It distracted attention from fundamental changes in institutions and social attitudes needed for the transition to be successful.
 Macro-level policy measures have to be complemented and supported by parallel micro-level efforts to educate the population about the new economic system, to generate a free flow of information – not just freedom, but the actual exchange of information, which is still severely limited in these countries – to develop new distribution systems, to impart appropriate business and managerial skills, to provide access to credit, to build up new social institutions and to en courage and promote new enterprises.
 In most cities of the former Soviet Union, for instance, there is not a single whole sale market for food.
 There are no systems for consumer credit, no agencies in charge of promoting small business development.
 In the absence of these and other essential micro-level conditions, even the right macro-level strategy will not evoke the anticipated response.
 6.Government regulation is essential for a free market: A free market does not mean an unregulated one.
 Quite understandably, decades of totalitarian government had generated such powerful resentment against strong government that by way of re action the society sought for solutions which did not require government to take a highly visible, leading role.
 The reform programme was based on the implicit assumption that the market is a self-regulating mechanism which can substitute for regulation by government.
 This notion is contradicted by the experience and practice of every major market economy in the world.
 Government plays a critically important role in defining and protecting property rights, ensuring competitive conditions, controlling monopolies, regulating foreign trade, establishing and enforcing quality standards, safeguarding the rights of investors and consumers, preserving the environment from over-exploitation and pollution, encouraging investment, and upholding the rights of employees to minimum wages, safe working conditions and social security in the case of lay-offs.

“Seth?” Emily spun in a circle but Seth was nowhere to be found.
 Seth walked out from behind a tree.
 But he was normal Seth.
 He had his dirty blonde hair back and was wearing his dirty jeans and shirt from school.
 No dark red hair, no glimmering sword, no bleeding wound.
 His warrior self was nowhere to be seen.
 “Seth how’d you do that?” I asked.
 He whirled around.
 “Who’s there?” “Me, you idiot!” I snorted.
 He stared at the place where I was standing, but his eyes weren’t focused on me.

There weren't that many of them, but they could've decided to push the issue regardless."
 I spent the rest of the trip, expecting someone to jump out of the trees, but faster than I'd have believed possible, the wrought iron gates I'd noticed on our trip out last night were swinging open, and we were turning off onto Alec's asphalt lane.
 A distinguished-looking gentleman in his fifties was waiting for us as we screeched to a stop.
 His slightly disapproving frown hinted at decades of practice letting his 'bosses' know when they'd just crossed some kind of line, all the while never crossing any himself.
 The shape shifters all exited the car, most before it had even stopped moving, and then Jessica and Dominic both appeared as I made my comparatively slow way out of the vehicle.
 "...everyone's okay.
 I was somewhat worried about taking so much of our strength away.
 I'm glad it worked out."
 Alec turned towards the older man as I made my hesitant way over to the group.
 "Donovan, this is the young lady we hosted last night.

My stepfather and his associates spoke openly about their various girlfriends and the dual lives they led.
 Dino also had a girlfriend and a separate apartment in which he put her up.
 My brother and I were young and we were afraid of this man so we didn’t disclose what we knew to anyone.
 When I was about fourteen years old, I missed curfew, which I knew was a big mistake.
 I tried to open the door with no sound.
 As I turned in the entryway to close the door as quietly as I had opened it, I felt a presence.
 I turned around and two hands were on my neck choking me and shoving me against the door.
 Dino, in the darkness, had a grip on my neck that he would not release.
 I grabbed his wrist and tried to push his hands off to no avail.
 I couldn’t breathe, so I couldn’t talk.

You'll just have to be satisfied with the fact that you'll both continue to be able to live in our fine city."
 Normally I would have just acquiesced, but I couldn't bear the thought of letting him leave, taking with him the identity of the only person besides my mom who really cared what happened to me.
 I tightened my grip in an attempt to stop him.
 "Please, if you won't tell me who it is, let me write a thank you note.
 I have to do something.
 He's done so much for us."
 He stopped partway through shaking his head.
 "I can't promise he'll even bother to read it, but I'll take it to him if you promise never to talk about this again.
 I don't want to hear even the slightest rumor anything unusual happened in association with this project."
 I nodded, relieved I'd have a chance to jot down a couple of lines, that I'd at least have that much of a link with our protector.

Their problems are further aggravated by environmental degradation due to soil erosion, deforestation and depletion of water resources.
 Lack of effective organization and management is a common denominator linking all these deficiencies.
 More effective forms of organizations can eliminate or compensate for these deficiencies to a large extent.
 For example, in India more than 10 million farmers are successfully engaged in sugarcane cultivation, precisely because an established system of contract farming provides them with access to technology, quality inputs, credit and an assured market for their produce.
 India became the world leader in milk production only because of the power of scale conferred on small producers through the dairy cooperative movement.
 A similar organization is presently lacking for most other crops.
 The successful establishment of more than one million Self-Help Groups (SHGs) in India over the past three years providing access to credit for 15 million small farmers illustrates the power of organization.
 It is an indication that the phase of society’s predominant dependence on government initiatives for development is coming to a close.
 An organization combining the advantages of SHGs and contract farming through the agency of an NGO or an agri-business centre operated by farm and home science graduates or entrepreneurs can be successfully extended to other crops, providing the technical knowledge and essential inputs that small farmers need to raise productivity and farm incomes.
 Crop Diversification: Eradicating hunger necessitates shifting production from traditional crops to higher value added crops that can improve nutrition, while generating higher on-farm incomes and greater off-farm employment.

For a second I couldn't even think.
 He'd just used the 'L-word', and my heart felt like it was tearing itself apart inside my chest.
 In the subtle shadings we girls used to measure commitment, it wasn't as good as if he'd come right out and said, 'I love you Adriana Paige', but it was still pretty good, and it was a complete first for me.
 Once I made it past the second part of his statement, I was able to start considering the first part of what he'd said.
 It was horrifying and amazing all at once, and it made complete sense.
 His mom was living in memories because the real world was just a pale shadow of her life with his father.
 Alec seemed to take my silence as condemnation, or possibly just agreement with his self-condemnation.
 "We're where the legends of succubi originated.
 Irresistible demons who drain their victims dry, who leave their lovers a hollow shell of what they were before."
 I'd finally worked through things enough inside my mind, to respond, but he bulldozed right over me.

Anything, no matter how trivial, signal the wolves.” Wolves.
 They had been wolves, not dogs.
 I immediately had more respect for the tall, pale-haired elves.
 Men who tamed wild wolves.
 We were back at the house in what seemed like a heartbeat.
 Steed watched the village from the front room.
 Ruby sat with me on her bed, the door closed.
 “This will calm you,” she said.
 A sprinkle of glitter hit my face before I had the chance to protest.
 “Just a touch,” she assured me, “just a touch.” It was too late.

This man was called the “Undertaker,” but I am not sure what he did.
 Maybe he really was an undertaker but I doubt it.
 Another man they called “The Banker,” and he really was a banker but he was crooked as a stick.
 They had something on him because he would do whatever my stepfather told him to do.
 I remember going to the bank and walking in or out with bags of cash.
 The “Judge” was actually a Judge and he lived next door.
 He was a nice man.
 I babysat his kids and watched his house while he vacationed, and did some odd jobs for him.

 It stalked towards me.
 The piercing green eyes bore into mine and I was more scared than I had ever been in all 15 years of my life.
 “Jazell move!” Seth yelled and pushed me behind him so hard, I almost fell over.
 I caught myself and pulled out my bow, notching an arrow.
 We all tensed, prepared for a fight.
 All of a sudden, Emily walked towards the dragon.
 Seth yelled at her to get back but she ignored him.
 She stood right in front of its head and opened her mouth, bizarre sounds started coming out.
 We all stood there mesmerized as she grunted, growled, snorted and hissed at the dragon.

11.Revamp higher education: Educational systems which 'manufacture graduates' compound the problem rather than alleviating it.
 The problem of the educated unemployed is not so much the amount of education they receive, but the type of knowledge and attitudes imparted.
 Reorient the educational curriculum at all levels, especially higher education, to impart the knowledge and attitudes needed to promote self-employment and entrepreneur ship rather than salaried employment.
 12.Employment planning: Studies of Japan and the NIEs indicate that conscious employment planning is an essential requirement for generating full employment.
 Place the employment objective high on the national agenda and evolve a comprehensive plan to achieve full employment by identifying untapped growth potentials in agriculture, industry, exports and services.
 Launch a nationwide programme to implement all employment-related strategies on a highest priority basis.
 Comprehensive Strategies
 While most of the prescriptions listed above are known to all, very few are systematically and efficiently applied.
 Africa can benefit enormously by applying strategies that have worked in Asia.
 The ‘Prosperity 2000’ programme evolved by ICPF for India and presented in the next chapter seeks to utilize a combination of these strategies to generate 100 million new jobs within a decade or less, which will be sufficient to raise 25 per cent of the world’s poorest billion people above the poverty line.

 That night, Velixar gave them their orders, putting in motion his plan to blanket the east in war.
 “In Celed there is a male elf by the name of Ahrqur Tun’del,” he told the two under the cover of stars.
 “He has visited King Vaelor before, and was quite vocal when the elves were expelled from his capital city.
 He is well known in Woodhaven, at least to those of elven blood.
 I need him killed and his body brought before me.”
 “How will we hide the body?” asked Harruq.

After looking at the clock for the thousandth time, I finally got up and went downstairs.
 The lights were still blazing, just as I'd left them.
 I debated for several seconds before opening the door and stepping out into the darkness.
 Somehow the porch light didn't reach out as far into the yard as I'd remembered.
 Alec appeared on the edge of the light with such suddenness that a startled yelp escaped me despite my best efforts.
 "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you."
 Strangely enough, I believed him.
 He was moving with the same, over-controlled care I'd seen him use around Rachel.
 "It's okay, it must be really limiting to always have to pretend you're slow and normal."
 His expression took on an alien cast, as he shrugged.

Lightning struck around me, cracking the dark stones of the walls.
 Reed of Keithar Peak stood before me and suddenly I was on a pedestal, looking down as he wagged his tongue at me.
 I scorned him, burning a chunk of it off, and he smiled.
 I jolted awake, the smell of burning flesh still lingering in my senses, and was staring at Ruby’s ceiling.
 Curse her.
 I was alone in her bed, but could hear an exchange of low whispers from the open door as she and Steed conversed in the front room.
 I wasn’t about to announce I had woken.
 My head didn’t throb as before, no sour mouth.
 It was overall a much better experience.
 But who could stand the dreams?

“Can’t Seem to Make Her Mine” should have been huge for The Seeds, yet it only charted, barely.
 I think.
 So, most people think they only did “Pushin’ Too Hard.”  Their first album is actually really kick-ass, better than the Stones, if you ask me, better than 12 X 5, better than Out of Our Heads.
 Inexplicable, really, who makes it and who doesn’t.
 Best not even ponder it.
 I mean, if Black Lung had charted nationally, higher, well, who knows, you know?

 Shit, who cares?
 I mean, I wouldn’t be here then.
 I wouldn’t be the working man you see before you.

"Do you have a minute?"
 Happy to be able to do something, I hurried over and took a look at her open book.
 "Fractions, huh?"
 "Yeah, I'm supposed to reduce them after I finish adding, but I can't seem to get to the same answer as the book on this one."
 She'd transposed a couple of the numbers when working on one of the intermediate steps.
 "Here it is, you've changed the numbers here, it should be fourteen sixty-fifths, not fourteen fifty-sixths."
 Rachel's skin was several shades darker than mine, tan enough that it didn't show embarrassment as easily, but it still looked like she'd gone the slightest bit red.
 "Oh, I'm sorry to bug you with such a stupid mistake."
 "Don't worry about it.
 I'm just glad it was that easy.

They dug a large hole in a corner and then bled the body dry, letting the fluids soak into the dirt.
 Occasionally, they would halt and listen, worried their violent struggle had reached unwanted ears.
 No curious investigators arrived, however, and they continued with their dark deed.
 When the blood dripping from the elf’s wounds became but a trickle, they filled the hole and moved on.
 Using the clothes and robes from upstairs, the two brothers wiped away as much of Ahrqur’s blood as they could.
 They tossed the bloody clothes, the table, and the pieces of glass they into the fireplace and burned them.
 Harruq wrapped the body in spare blankets he found in a closet.
 “Grab the sword,” he said as he hoisted the dead elf onto his shoulder.
 “I have it,” Qurrah said, retrieving the elven blade and its dark green sheath from the floor.
 They gave one last look around.

"Stupid shape shifters.
 None of them can get drunk, so they deprive the rest of us of the best parts of being young and stupid."
 Once we arrived at the park, I did my best to pretend obliviousness to all of the gasps and stares as we trickled out of the limo.
 It was a good thing Alec had such a steady arm, it was all I could do not to stumble as I took in the transformation that'd taken place.
 Our group glided up to the covered pavilion, surrounded in a pocket of silence as the rest of the crowd turned to see who'd just arrived.
 Alec produced tickets for all of us from a pocket somewhere while I was still taking in the sheer number of lights that'd been assembled for the occasion.
 The decorations inside the pavilion were amazing.
 Swathes of silk gave the open-air building an ethereal feel, while candles and other light sources created a soft illumination.
 I didn't have to possess preternatural hearing to catch whispers about the city having received a very large, very anonymous donation just a few days before.
 The committee had obviously chosen to spend it on decorations.

 How about you Jim, should I be beaten for that play on words.
 Jim – I think I’ll exercise my right to withhold my opinion until after the beating is issued.
 Eugene – I thought it was funny.
 Well since you two don’t appreciate my brand of humor I think I’m going to bed.
 Maybe I’ll get lucky and dream about that cheerleader.

Acknowledgments: A big thanks to all of the fans who are doing so much to help get the word out.
 There are tons of you that I don't know, but I do want to make special mention of a few dependable souls that I'm very grateful to know, and who've helped in various ways with Torn, and who I suspect will continue to go above and beyond with Broken.
 Cassy & Mark, I'm glad you both turned out to be story addicts just like me.
 Thanks for everything.
 Dad, not everyone gets to be best friends with their parents.
 Thanks for all of the feedback and the ongoing support.
 Mimi, thanks for sticking with me long enough to get addicted and to fix some of my biology facts along the way.
 As always, Katie deserves special thanks.
 Without her, Alec and Adri's story never would have seen the light of day.
 Thanks need to be expressed to Obsidian Dawn, www.obsidiandawn.com, for brushes used in the creation of Broken's cover.

Marie had surely been through a very traumatic experience, and they shouldn't make her talk about it until she was ready.
 "Why don't I have Louise make us some breakfast, and we can talk," Mrs. Tranton suggested.
 "If you can take your hands off our daughter long enough."
 Mrs. Tranton smiled.
 She'd been caressing Marie's hair and shoulders and arms.
 "You seem to be having a problem with that yourself."
 He grunted, stroking Marie's cheek and then tilting her chin up.
 "We have been out of our minds with fear.
 We had no idea what had happened to you."
 "I know.

"No, I just did it for you.
 Maybe not so much at first, but I couldn't get you out of my mind.
 You were everywhere I looked.
 In my class, at lunch, even in my dreams.
 I couldn't get away from you."
 I felt my heart skip another beat.
 Everything good that I'd attributed to Brandon had been Alec all along.
 I didn't understand what I'd seen a few hours ago, but he wasn't a monster.
 The amount of hurt in his voice took him out of the category of frightening.
 I moved a little closer.

BG:  	Did they?
 Ok.  Oh, you know, there were all these groups back then with psychedelic names, uh, Raspberry Batman—they were funny, Jack and the Beanstalks, The House of Dr. Dee, The Savage God, The Seven Madmen—
 LE: 	Without Feathers.
 BG: 	Right, they were good actually.
 Almost had a hit—what was that sucker—oh!
 “You’re Standing on my Train.”  Nice little number.
 Running Dog, Peabody and Sherman—that’s a funny story, really.
 They started at Peabody School, so that’s where the Peabody comes in, and the lead singer’s name was really Sherman.
 When they opened for us—I remember it was really fucking hot that night, one of those Memphis nights where the humidity feels like urine in the air—and they were talking to us backstage.
 And I said, I like your name—I’m a big Bulwinkle fan.

In doing so, it ignores the right and responsibility of these nations to provide for their own legitimate security needs at a time when no alternative mechanism exists at the international level to ensure the inviolability of their borders.
 There is truth in the claim that military spending by developing countries has increased dramatically during the past 30 years.
 This increase is partially explained by the fact that more than 100 new sovereign nations have emerged, many of which were protected, prior to independence, by the colonial powers that have now withdrawn.
 The acquisition of even modest defensive capabilities may consume a significant portion of national income when the economic base is small, as it is for many of these nations.
 In addition, the increasing incidence of war, terrorism and drug-related violence in the developing world has heightened the sense of insecurity among these countries.
 However, a closer analysis reveals that half of the military expenditure of the developing world is incurred by a small number of oil-exporting countries in the Middle East and North Africa, and another quarter is incurred by other high-income developing nations, mostly in East and South East Asia – whereas the 84 developing nations with lower and lower-middle incomes, including such large nations as China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Bangladesh, comprising 72 per cent of the world’s population, incur roughly 6 per cent of global military expenditure, on average less than 3 per cent of the total GDP of these countries.
 International pressure for defining acceptable levels of military expenditure and reducing defence budgets is entirely warranted, provided that it is applied equitably to all countries, takes into account the varying conditions between regions and nations, and places corresponding limitations on arms exports by industrialized nations.
 Placed under the control of an impartial international agency specialized in security issues, rather than being left to development banks or made an instrument of bilateral policy by donor nations, these measures could effect a further 50 to 75 per cent cut in global defence spending and thereby generate $400 billion to $600 billion per year for non-military purposes, equal to roughly ten times current levels of overseas development assistance.
 The international community should commit itself to a minimum goal of reducing global military expenditure to $400 billion (in 1992 constant dollars) by 2000 AD.
 Military expenditure mitigates but does not resolve the underlying problem of security.

Though not being his friend was probably more dangerous.
 I was shaking my head in disbelief as he turned back to me and bowed.
 He stepped back, taking a seat as the wiry man stepped inside the circle then.
 He nodded to me.
 Grey.
 He was thoughtful for a moment, deciding the best way to display his skill, before finally approaching to offer his hand.
 I reached forward, placing my palm against his, and then he was gone.
 His entire body had vanished.
 I half expected to feel his touch—perhaps he’d merely camouflaged himself—but my hand was empty.
 I looked around, baffled.

And from the character comes the destiny.” Stupefied by stress as I was, I sat a while wondering where on that continuum I should start trouble-shooting, until the obvious made itself clear.
 Start with the spirit.
 So, I thought, what could best set my spirit on the right path?
 I believe it was God who sent the message: "Look here, you're a writer.
 But for months you haven't been writing, which has grieved your spirit into a coma.
 Sure, teaching nine classes and raising kids is hard, but it’s not going to kill you.
 What will kill you is not writing.” The next morning, I got up at 5 a.m. instead of 5:30, which allowed me to write for a half hour.
 Not much, but enough to give me hope, which is the antidote to despair.
 The stuff I wrote during those half-hour sessions became crucial parts of my novel The Loud Adios.
 About a month after the semester ended, I sent the manuscript to a national contest.

His nod was hesitant, but my wan smile seemed to reassure him somewhat.
 "I guess that makes sense.
 Nobody likes to be told there's something wrong with them, but I can't exactly say everything is just Jim Dandy.
 Not when I still collapse at the mere mention of what I've lost."
 The silence wasn't as comfortable now.
 I had to break it, even if it meant further examining all of the holes inside me that I'd spent so many months struggling to ignore.
 "So you're just one of those guys that can't resist trying to help the broken girls, huh?"
 "No.
 That's Dominic's theory, I didn't say it was mine.
 I did what I did because when I close my eyes I still see you there."

I think that he probably did the right thing.
 No way to know for sure, but they did not rip him apart, so we will say he was very brave and not very stupid.” Then he added, “Of course, if you had asked me before hand, I would have said that taking food from a Dire Cat was a very stupid idea.” He finished with a smile full of sharp teeth almost a match for the lions and in a casual movement lowered his horned head in what Rodregas thought might be his equivalent of a shrug.
 The next morning they repeated the Morning Prayer and meditation ritual.
 This time while Doi’van joined in, Imeralda mostly watched.
 Afterwards Rodregas said to both, “I have been thinking that we are probably going to be here a few weeks while I finish healing up from the knife wound.
 I want to make the most of the time.” Doi’van said, “I have a feeling that you have some sort of training in mind.” Rodregas nodded and said, “I have developed some bad habits the last few years; I know my technique is rusty and now my timing is all off with my new body.
 I am not sure what your training backgrounds are, though.” He said, waving at Imeralda, who often of late was holding her Black Yew bow close with an intimacy that spoke more of a caress than holding a weapon, “Clearly, Imeralda likes the bow.” Rodregas continued, “Even though Imeralda plans to stay out of the middle of things, learning some basic hand-to-hand and sword fighting is a good idea.
 Doi’van and I can spar with each other, which will help us get used to fighting against the sigil warriors of The Immortal Guard.
 So, I think we should practice every morning until noon, then work to try to get the farm cleaned up during the rest of the day.
 At dusk we can work again on our fighting technique.” Doi’van nodded and said, “Before we battle a group of Immortalists or The Immortal Guards, we need to get some decent armor and weapons.

The void was reluctant to let me go, stripping me of memories and experiences as I fought my way free.
 By the time I was near surfacing I no longer remembered just how much I'd wanted to stay.
 Britney was pacing back and forth when I opened my eyes.
 She had her cell phone out and was looking like she wanted to dial 911, but was worried about the possible fallout.
 I was on the ground, which for some reason made me more irritable than it should have.
 Didn't she realize how hard it was to make it over to someone before collapsing like that?
 It kind of defeated the whole point if they then put you on the ground where your clothes would take their normal, instantaneous-collapse beating.
 "Oh my gosh, are you okay?
 I wasn't sure what to do."
 "I'm okay, I just need a minute."

I remember he would carry a rare $1000 bill and attempt to pay his bill with it to shock the waiters, who would say, “We can’t change that!” My mom was wearing fur coats and new jewelry all the time.
 Dino was “in the import-export” business; we would later find out that he was involved in a criminal enterprise and during this time was smuggling diamonds.
 It was not unusual for Dino’s associates to come to the house with weapons inside their jackets.
 When they played poker, stacks of hundred dollar bills spilled across the table, and one of the requirements to sit at the table was to put your gun in a pile of weapons across the room.
 I guess they didn’t want the loser to play his trump card with a pistol!
 My brother and I hustled drinks for them for small tips.
 After we were told to go to bed, we would hide behind the counter that blocked the table where they played cards.
 We could stay there late into the night and hear details of these shady lives.
 They all had odd nicknames.
 One man was called “The Painter” and I have no idea where the name came from but I did know that if they needed someone’s house “painted” that this man was going there to kill them.

These blades will make you faster and more skillful than ever before.
 Forget everything you know about yourself, and know only that you are unstoppable.”
 Harruq took the other sword and held both in his hands.
 He noticed the writing that flared on each hilt, one red, the other gold.
 “What do they say?” he asked, staring at them in wonder.
 “Condemnation and Salvation.
 You are judgment, Harruq.
 May it be swift and merciless.”
 Harruq sheathed the swords and clipped them to his belt.
 He knelt as his head swirled.

Outside of what we bring, there will not be much.
 But it will be a good place to rest and…” he said gently patting his stomach, “heal up.
 We should be there by nightfall.” “Not bad,” said Imeralda.
 “Sounds like a place that will be hard to find, but is this not territory infested with wild Dire beast?” “Yup,” Rodregas said, “another reason I think this area is usually hard to find; most people stay clear.” He continued after a pause to let them think of entering territory known to be the hunting range of feared predators, “I never saw any sign of any Dire beast in the hollows when I was there, but, of course, they probably know of the place.
 Still, I would rather handle a pack of Hellhounds than The Immortal Guards.” Neither looked pleased at his logic, but both nodded.
 A few hours later it was starting to get dark as Rodregas recognized the spot and turned the wagon left for the final hard assent.
 At this point there was no trail, and common sense would have argued against the path.
 It was hard work.
 The horses had to be hand-led around rocks and trees and pulled up.
 Doi’van and Rodregas had to manhandle the wagon around a few corners which was easier to do than it should have been, but Celestial and Hellborn strength together made short work of it.

How’s your head?”
 Harruq grumbled as he plopped down.
 “My head is fine.”
 From behind her back, Aurelia pulled out a small blue object.
 “Ever seen one of these before?” she asked.
 The half-orc stared at it, thinking.
 Suddenly he knew, and he looked at Aurelia in total disbelief.
 “Is that a book?”
 The elf nodded.
 “Is it a safe assumption that you don’t know how to read?”

He hadn’t attended a dozen funerals, known anyone like Eric, read Nietzsche or Dostoyevski.
 Most of all, he wasn’t Billy Graham.
 Besides, I glanced to the right of the kid and saw the babe with auburn curls.
 She stood with hands folded at her waist and creamy white legs quivering below the hem of her flowered sundress.
 Then I knew for certain that if I smiled and she smiled back and I asked her name and number and picked her up later at her churchgoing folks’ house and promised to bring her home by midnight, I would drive to a lookout at the sea cliffs and invite her into the back seat.
 And if she complied, I would do exactly what I would have done yesterday, before I surrendered.
 I might be forgiven, but I felt no less corrupt than before.
 Lucky for her, we lost her in the crowd.
 In the car, Cliff and I didn’t mention surrendering.
 We drove to a party, and told nobody about Billy Graham.

It was a mistake because I soon found myself being zipped into a delicate, green dress that I was absolutely positive wasn't going to survive the experience of trying to wrap itself around me.
 "Oh, it's perfect, Adri.
 We have to get it."
 I avoided looking at the mirror.
 It seemed like a crime to defile such a pretty dress, and I wanted to remember it like it had looked on the hanger, all shimmery and wispy.
 I did risk a look down at the price tag.
 My heart actually skipped a beat.
 That was more than some people spent on their first car.
 "Rachel, you've already bought me way too much.
 I can't let you get this.

His eyes seemed of no use so he closed them and simply walked toward where he knew she was.
 He felt Doi’van grab onto his shoulder and follow him.
 When he opened his eyes, he saw that they had entered another great chamber.
 At first he thought it was the same size as the first chamber until his eyes saw the huge tree in the middle and followed it up and then up.
 The tree soared above them so high that Rodregas thought it must be far higher than the Cathedral itself.
 This was, of course, impossible.
 As Rodregas stopped beside Imeralda he tried to see the shape of the leaf to identify the type of tree, but the leaves were so high up he could only see a very general shape.
 The shape of the trunk reminded him of a white oak, but the color was a darker gray with touches of striped brown.
 The trunk was huge, thicker than the towers of the keep.
 But that made no sense to Rodregas.

I didn’t get the joke.
 “You’re serious?” Steed said, humor vanished as he gaped at Chevelle.
 “What, she’s a bright lighter?” Chevelle was across the gap and in his face almost before Steed could stand.
 I jerked back in response, but a screeching siren pierced my ears and I doubled over, covering them.
 It was inside, a screaming, terrible howl coming from my ears.
 I tried to force my eyes open, hoping someone would help me, but they were just standing there, chest to chest, arguing.
 Did they not see me?
 I ached to scream for help, but couldn’t get a sound out, couldn’t breathe.
 They leaned toward each other, oblivious to anything else.
 My eyes closed as I curled into a ball.

"Admit it, Adri, we didn't get sunsets like this very often in Minnesota."
 "Adriana," I corrected automatically, trying to avoid thinking about where my nickname had come from.
 The sunset was beautiful, just starting to turn the sky pink as a prelude to the glorious oranges that would no doubt follow.
 It was the kind of thing that Mom was always trying to capture with her camera, but which never seemed to turn out quite as good as the real thing.
 The sunset wasn't what captured my interest though, it was the greenery.
 Mom's room looked out to the west, the gorgeous side that reminded me of the place and people that would always be home.
 Mom carting me off to the middle of nowhere wasn't going to change that.
 There was a huge tree on the far edge of the yard.
 It was a species I didn't recognize, but it still called to me.
 For a second I could almost hear a familiar voice whispering in my ear.

I expected Rachel to back down as soon as she realized he was spoiling for a fight, but if anything she looked more determined.
 It was hard to believe this was the same person I'd had to rescue from Cassie so recently.
 I stopped Rachel just before she could put the impressive lungful of air she'd just taken in to whatever use she'd planned.
 "It's okay.
 I'm better.
 The lane's dusty and exercise would do me good."
 She hesitated, obviously torn, but my fumbling fingers finally found the unfamiliar door release and I made the decision for her.
 I swung the door open and slipped out of the car before she could respond.
 I waved goodbye with a cheery casualness I thought did a pretty good job of hiding my desire to break into tears.
 It was amazing how I'd let the numbness slip away for nothing.

 Harruq halted before the mess that had been his prey.
 The line of undead stood motionless, their unfocused eyes looking nowhere.
 The wind blew through them, shifting their hair and whistling through the holes in their bodies.
 The half- orc said nothing, just stared at the carnage and the servants of his master as he waited for Qurrah.
 The mindless rage that had consumed him slowly faded.

Humanity is on the threshold of unprecedented opportunities to promote peace and accelerate human development.
 Yet, as in the past, our vision of these opportunities is obstructed by conceptions and attitudes inherited from a bygone era.
 To fully appreciate the emerging opportunities, we need to more clearly comprehend the events of the past two decades that are the seeds from which these opportunities spring.
 Restructuring the UN
 The formation of the International Commission on Peace & Food was conceived in 1987, a time when mutual suspicions, escalating military expenditure and confrontational Cold War rhetoric blinded the world to the possibility of radically transforming the global security environment.
 Yet, fuelled by the bold initiatives of Mikhail Gorbachev, by the time ICPF conducted its first meeting on the border of the rapidly vanishing Iron Curtain at Trieste in September 1989, the Berlin Wall had fallen, Cold War hostilities had melted, and the prospect of ushering in a more peaceful and prosperous world for all seemed within reach.
 The euphoria of those heady days generated high expectations of a peace dividend that would help to wipe away much of the world’s suffering.
 At the same time, the withdrawal of the confrontation between East and West resulted in a gradual shift of attention from the threat of imminent global self-destruction to lesser but very real problems, among them – the unresolved danger arising from huge stockpiles of nuclear weapons; some 26 on-going localized military conflicts within and between developing nations, aggravated by increased trafficking in small armaments; the persistence of hunger and malnutrition, especially among the poorest populations of South Asia and politically unstable regions of Africa; progressively rising levels of unemployment in both industrialized and developing countries; and the turbulence and hardship of political, economic and social transition in post-Communist Eastern Europe.
 These challenges, coupled with the outbreak of the first Gulf War, the disintegration of Yugoslavia, and the horrendous civil wars that wracked Somalia and Rwanda, clouded the world’s vision of a brighter future.
 It was in this context that the Commission undertook five years of research that led to the publication of its report in the fall of 1994.

I might see some lint on your shirt that needed to be brushed off.
 Like this."
 He turned to face her and reached behind her to brush off the imaginary lint, his arm drawing her close.
 Marie laughed.
 "I think there's lint a little lower on my back."
 Reaching lower meant he had to draw her closer.
 "Hmmm--there's a piece at the top too."
 His free hand slid along her waist and up to her shoulder blade, the result being an embrace.
 "Now you're lint free."
 She laughed again.

I have asked, how much did he know?
 I had always supposed his prescience was shadowy.
 But maybe not.
 By that Sunday morning when he showed up at Kenny Niedermeyer's, he might have gotten the whole message.
 I think about standing outside the basketball gym a month before his last day, when Eric could easily have run like he insisted Billy and I do.
 But he said “I’m going to stay and take my punishment.” “For what?” I asked, and he didn’t answer.
 For what?
 I still want to know.
 A favorite mystery writer of mine, Ross McDonald, earned this praise from a reviewer: “McDonald doesn’t write about crime.
 He writes about sin.” I think back to the day I spent asking kids whether they often felt guilty about something but had no idea what it was.

 In silence, Harruq Tun stared at the body.
 Seven, he guessed.
 No older than seven.
 He didn’t know the boy’s name or why he had wandered into the forest.
 The bloodied corpse was sprawled across the knotted roots of a tree, its innards spilled through a massive gash from shoulder to waist.
 The eyes remained open, their young innocence spoiled by a lingering look of horror.
 _You’re an orc, aren’t you?_
 Harruq snarled and shook his head.

Mrs. Campbell needed a little bit of reassuring when she stopped by my desk, which I did happily now that my personal universe was looking up once again, and then I dug into my homework with near-normal gusto.
 Time flew by all too quickly.
 Soon it was just me holding down the fort and trying to take care of a trio of freshmen girls who seemed to be at least slightly ahead of the normal cramming curve.
 I was glad they weren't waiting until the day before the test to come in for help, but it was looking like tomorrow wasn't going to be any fun.
 Maybe I'd get lucky again, and most of the lazy ones would give up before my shift started.
 I turned around from explaining for the fourth time to the third person why you couldn't prove congruence of two triangles with the nonexistent angle-angle-angle postulate, only to find that Britney had slipped out of the room.
 It was possible she'd just gone to the restroom.
 I tried to remind myself of all of the places she could be, and all of the reasons she might have left that didn't involve abandoning me here.
 Rachel met me on my way back to my table to gather up my books.
 "She left with Rick Anders."

“Frey.” A husky voice woke me.
 It must have been early dawn.
 The faint light revealed worry on Chevelle’s face as he stood over me.
 A look of fear and sympathy.
 The memory smashed into my chest like a thousand-pound ram, stealing my breath.
 “You,” I hissed.
 He backed away as I sat up and glared at him with fire in my eyes.
 “You.
 You held me back as my mother died.
 You held me and made me watch her die.” I could almost taste the acid in my voice.

And then we were in the throne room.
 My father’s face was indescribable, his fury almost tangible.
 I couldn’t bring myself to look away from him, but I saw Rune standing in my peripheral vision.
 I was caught.
 I frantically searched for some explanation.
 But he didn’t speak.
 He flipped his arm, dismissing me.
 The tension showed in that small movement and I blanched.
 I started to pull away from the guard but he didn’t release me.
 I realized then I hadn’t been dismissed.

The solid feel of his body was just as permanent as always, but there was no tingle where our skin touched.
 Almost as though sensing my thoughts, Alec hugged me tightly and buried his chin in my hair.
 "I know you don't want to hear this, but it isn't too late for you to change your mind.
 Even now, it'd be a relatively simple thing to have you halfway across the country by the time the challenge actually occurs."
 The thought of what was coming filled me with dread, but I shook my head.
 As scary as all of this was, I knew flying away and never knowing what'd happened would be worse.
 Alec was probably going to die, and all of the rest of us with him, but if he didn't, if the pack somehow managed to survive the coming crisis, I wanted to be there.
 Alec was more than capable of sending me away and then never letting me know he'd survived.
 There was a constant war inside him over what to do with me and I couldn't afford to give up my one advantage.
 He seemed less able to contemplate cutting me out of his life when I was around.

He kissed her hair.
 "That's because it's become so natural to you."
 Rick sat in a chair across from Marie rather than joining her on the loveseat so that they wouldn't appear too familiar with each other.
 He was glad his conscience had gotten the best of him and kept him from seducing her Monday night.
 If having Teri and Jeremy suspect that they were living together embarrassed her, losing her virginity before marriage would devastate her.
 "So how did you like my sister?"
 Rick asked Marie when their guests had left.
 "She's really nice.
 So is Jeremy.
 I'd like to have them over again next week."

 The first week of training went well for both Harruq and Aurelia.
 The half-orc kept on the offensive, determined not to add a fresh set of bruises to his body.
 Aurelia still fell for the feints, however slow, but her blocks were already quicker and more precise.
 They fought until both collapsed against trees, sweat soaking their bodies.
 “You’re starting to get the hang of it,” Harruq said after their fifth session.
 “Don’t flatter me,” Aurelia said, refastening one of her braids that had come loose.
 “You’re still going too easy.”
 “If I move too fast you won’t learn anything,” Harruq insisted.
 “How do you know?” she asked.

The arena smelled fresh.
 Sometime during the night it must have rained and young squires had raked the sands.
 The final competition of the tournament was a true melee.
 Only the top ten finishers qualified.
 There was no taking turns.
 The ten were spread out in a circle.
 In the center of the arena was a shield painted with the seal of the knighthood, a winged sword in the clouds.
 The squire who claimed that shield and made it to the Cathedral’s main hall with it would be knighted on the spot by the Knight Commander of the Order.
 This day would decide Rodregas’ fate.
 It was likely to end in defeat.

I hadn't even known my neighbors growing up.
 In Minneapolis the people you lived next to and the people you associated with were always kept properly segregated.
 I tuned back into what Britney was saying just in time to answer a question with something safely non-committal.
 She didn't seem to need much in the way of responses to keep her talking.
 Probably for hours if she could get away with it.
 "I'm glad you feel the same.
 You'd think they'd be a little more welcoming.
 Instead it's like they go out of their way to make sure you know you don't really fit in.
 We've been here a year, and I still can't get invited to any of the really cool parties."
 I'd never been invited to any parties, let alone cool ones.

Cleo – After this, you are going to be a big celebrity.
 As famous as Andy Warhol at the very least.
 I imagine that the biggest art publications will all have stories about you.
 I’ll be so proud of you baby.
 Oh I cannot wait until I can tell all my friends.
 They will all be quite jealous.
 Liz – Something to look forward to.
 Cleo – Why baby what ever is wrong?
 Liz – I’m fine mother.
 Cleo – Darling clearly something is bothering you.

Nothing was going to get them to shut up now, not when they had such a perfect target.
 Sitting there staring at them was about the worst of all the choices open to me, but I was too shocked to pull my eyes away.
 I felt a surge of heat rush through me as the room wavered slightly.
 For a second I worried I was going to pass out, but movement behind the two punks distracted me from my heaving internal landscape.
 There was just enough light for me to see Alec lean forward and put a hand on each troublemaker's shoulder.
 There was an abortive movement by the two loudmouths, as they tried to spin around and confront him.
 Granted, the lighting was less than ideal, but it didn't look like Alec was holding onto them very hard.
 Still, neither of them made it more than a quarter of the way around before being slammed back down into their chairs.
 The tingly heat that'd convinced me Alec was staring at me earlier was back, and even more intense.
 I felt the tiny hairs on my neck stand up as the feeling redoubled yet again.

What about me?"
 Jasmin stopped moving.
 She was still shaking, and when she looked up at me, her eyes still bubbled with hate, but they were human again instead of the pale, ice blue from a moment before.
 With a visible effort of will, Jasmin closed her eyes, calmed her shaking body, and then turned and quickly walked out of the room.
 I was just tall enough to see over Rachel and take in what was going on in the rest of the room.
 James' eyes were still yellow, and he was still inching his way towards me, obviously undeterred by Jasmin's defection.
 The Hispanic girl carefully closed the distance between them, and then placed her slender, perfect dark hand on James' arm once again as she leaned in and whispered something in his ear.
 For a moment it seemed he was going to shake her off again but then he shuddered, shot Alec another dirty look, and stormed out of the room.
 The tiny form following after him looked like a fragile schooner trailing along the edge of a hurricane.
 The room seemed so calm after James disappeared that for a second I forgot Jessica was still half-crouched in the center of the room.

"I'm okay, I just need a minute."
 Since I was already on the ground, I really did just want to lie there for a moment, scorpions, dirt and all, but Britney didn't seem to understand that concept.
 Now that my eyes were open and the whole 911 question had been answered, she was determined to get me back on my feet.
 Chapter 8 I was midway through brushing my teeth before I realized I'd had another night filled with nothing but regular dreams.
 I'd walked into two different classes and found out that there were tests I'd forgotten about, been stranded at the side of the road, and been chased through some kind of rain forest, but while some of those dreams had been plenty terrifying, none of them had even a touch of the surreal vividness of the ones I'd had my first few nights in Sanctuary.
 Maybe they were just some kind of psychological defense mechanism popping up in response to all the changes.
 If so, I kind of wished I could be sick still.
 It's a heck of a thing to not want to be healthy, but I'd gone to bed most every night hoping I'd get to experience another one.
 It was depressing to think that I probably had one less thing to look forward to.
 Looking at the clock, I saw that I was a bit behind schedule.

“Never.” “You're going to have to, dude.
 We have a lot of walking left to do,” Seth said wearily.
 Jason groaned and circled up against the wall.
 Emily pulled her hood off and examined herself.
 She mumbled something and squeezed her sleeves.
 “I feel so heavy and gross.” Jason's eyes popped open.
 “Why are you complaining?
 You're freaking dryer than all of us and you got some awesome power, too.
 You can't complain.” “Language Jason,” she scolded.
 “I hate even being a tad wet so I feel like complaining.

That’s just so right.
 CM:  	Would you say Hendrix influenced you then?
 BG: 	No.
 CM:  	You didn’t—
 BG:  	Influenced me?
 No.
 He didn’t influence me.
 I loved the cat, man.

The job of the guards was to remain outside the circle but make sure that the prisoners stayed inside.
 Metal would interfere with the magic so the guards held simple wooden clubs and wore only linen clothes with no metal fastenings.
 As Rodregas pushed the half AElf into her circle, making sure not to disturb the bluish sand covered in swirls of colorful small crystals, he was surprised at how vulnerable he felt without his armor but readied himself for the task at hand.
 He quickly reached out to the woman and pulled off her gag, as even that would count as a binding and would interfere with the ritual.
 He wanted to whisper to her as he removed it, and give her a hint of the desperate gambit that he was about to try, but he knew that it was not worth the risk of others overhearing.
 Both of their lives depended on her doing what Rodregas had told her.
 If he succeeded, she would know what Rodregas had done; if he failed, well he was familiar enough with that feeling.
 He saw her lips forming something under her breath, probably a spell, but she did not have time to execute a spell of sufficient strength in the time left her.
 Magic took too long to prepare to be useful so quickly.
 Ravenhurr stepped into the last circle; the one made entirely of what appeared to be fresh blood and of symbols made from the careful placement of living organs.

The pitch-black shadow that padded towards me was some kind of cross between a leopard and a jaguar.
 A low growl rippled up out of Alec's throat as the large cat got closer, but she dropped to the ground and rolled onto her back.
 I started forward, but Donovan's hand closed around my arm, pulling me up short.
 Alec's gaze never left the prostrate shape shifter.
 He let her remain on the ground for several seconds, and then his chin dropped in an unmistakable nod.
 Moving with what had to be exaggerated care for someone capable of such speed, she rolled back onto her paws and crossed the remaining distance between us.
 Donovan released my arm as she reared up and placed her front paws on my shoulders.
 The colorless eyes didn't match any of the pack's human form, but they had Dominic's gentleness.
 She dropped back down and butted her head against my hand.
 I started petting her out of reflex, but when I slowed down out of embarrassment, she butted my hand again.

"Hey!"
 Rick backed out of the spray.
 Laughing, Marie pointed the water at him.
 "Have a drink!"
 "Marie!"
 He tried to run away, but she chased him.
 Thoroughly soaked, he changed tactics and ran toward her.
 She screeched and started to run, but he seized her around the waist and grabbed the hose.
 "You're in trouble now."
 He released her and then squirted her.

He’s a wimp, and a poor shot.
 He always runs out of courage before he achieves his goal of becoming ‘evil’.
 Jim – It was pretty funny when Mr Svinvali caught up with him.
 It’s a good thing that he didn’t tell Eugene’s father though, that was a relief, especially after the last time Gene’s dad found about one of his little adventures.
 Ah shit…
 Liz – …so that’s why Eugene was in the hospital for that entire week.
 He always claimed that he fell down the stairs to his basement, oh God, I teased him about it, I feel so bad.
 Jim – I wasn’t sposed to say anything, he’s gonna be pissed.
 Liz – what happened?
 Jim - Technically he did fall down the stairs.

I had never even thought to check there.
 Brandon stood up.
 Bryce glared into Brandon’s eyes, and in the room’s dead silence Bryce laid the drugs and the burned black-sketched foil on the counter like it was a dead animal.
 I stood in front of Brandon, looking slightly up at him, as he is taller than me.
 The room was silent and everyone awestruck.
 After what we just went through with him… I looked Brandon in his guilty darkened eyes and I said, “Prepare yourself to find out what will happen to you every time you lie to me… are you ready?” Before he could reply or even contemplate my words, I felt the crack of Brandon’s nose on my knuckles and he flew backwards off his feet.
 My family’s loud simultaneous gasps accompanied Harry and Bryce’s rush to restrain me as if I was going to continue the beating.
 Maybe kill Brandon.
 This is how angry we all were.
 How out of our element.

They were fearful creatures.
 I convinced them to raid the castle, gave them direction.
 And then I returned.
 I knew I would have time to prepare.
 They would be slow to gather and make the journey.
 I was thinking of Noble as I resolved to wear the dress meant for our wedding, with its dramatic shape and deep meaning.
 I remembered when he’d given it to me, explaining the white stood for innocence.
 I had stifled a giggle then.
 I could find no humor now.
 Yes, it would be fitting.

“Just…‌patience.”
 Another hour, and still no shadow.
 Harruq stepped back inside and plopped down.
 The other half-orc remained at the door, his eyes not leaving the gray outside.
 “He’s not sending for us,” Harruq said.
 “You are correct,” said Velixar’s voice, startling both of them.
 They turned to see their master emerge from the shadows of their home, his red eyes gleaming.
 “How did you get in here?” the warrior asked.
 “Listen to me,” Velixar said, ignoring the question.
 “I have little time.

Brandon was tugging on my arm now, not hard enough for anyone to think he'd been driven off by a mere school administrator, but urgently enough I allowed myself to be guided away.
 We hadn't gone more than a step or two before his grip on my arm grew painful.
 I hissed in discomfort and he released me, but not before I noticed that his other hand was white-knuckled and his jaw was clenched.
 "Sorry, I just don't like to see that kind of needless destruction.
 It makes everyone look bad and costs the town a lot of money."
 Brandon's smile was back, but it didn't have his trademark easy carelessness.
 "Now you sound like my mom."
 We rounded a corner before Brandon could say anything else and nearly ran into Britney.
 "Guys!
 Did you see the back door?"

Sharp, twisted horns sat on top of its head, gleaming in the dark.
 A long, billowing black cloak spiraled out behind it, completely covering the rest of its body.
 Its eyes shined red and full of hate, although there was a terrible smile that danced on its face.
 “VICTORY!” It boomed in a chilling voice.
 The crowds of monsters roared in applause and excitement.
 The trolls banged their clubs on the ground, on their chests, and even on each other.
 The howl of a Frost Beast rose into the night, making me feel even more chilled.
 I wanted to wake up.
 But I couldn’t.
 I needed to find out what that thing was and what it had killed.

Mallory's smile held only the faintest hint of regret.
 "No need to feel sorry for me.
 I've had a good run.
 A much better one than most of my friends did.
 If I haven't managed to accomplish what I was sent down to do in the course of almost a hundred and fifty years, then I've nobody to blame but myself."
 "Still, I'm sorry.
 You seem much too nice of a person to have had all of that happen to you."
 "Nonsense.
 If I am kind, it's no doubt because of those very experiences that I would've been the most desperate to avoid.
 I think most of the best people are that way exactly because of the things they've endured.

I'd been expecting some posh restaurant in Vegas or maybe LA.
 The world kind of becomes your oyster when you've got your own jet.
 The last thing I'd expected was a picnic up at the top of the mountain that cradled the Graves' estate between large, rocky spurs.
 It was perfect.
 For Alec money was nothing more than a useful tool, but he understood I still wasn't comfortable having that tool used to purchase me things I didn't really need.
 I'd set out determined to hike the whole way up to the top, but I was still a little weak.
 Apparently everyone had been right about just how much blood I'd lost the night our pack had destroyed the local rival pack.
 They'd been trying to absorb Alec's pack for the last several years and he hadn't really had any other options, but I knew he still felt uneasy about what had happened.
 With his superhuman hearing and sense of smell, Alec knew I was struggling before I even did.
 He waited though until I finally admitted how tired I was, and then he scooped me up and effortlessly jogged to the top of the peak.

I pulled an arrow out faster than you could say oh-my-god-there’s-a-hideous-monster-coming-to-whip-our-butts.
 And then I launched it.
 The arrow shot at Kojas, speeding through the air.
 But what did Kojas do?
 He whipped out his sword and slashed the arrow in half right before it hit him.
 The pieces fell on the ground.
 Holy tamale.
 I stared at the cracked pieces of my arrow and my flare of determination went out with a poof.
 Great, now what do I do?
 That was a fail, I scolded myself.

"That was some kind of promoter.
 She wants me to go out and shoot a fashion show in Paris.
 For a week and a half, and then another one in Italy.
 I've never heard of either of the shows, but she's offering me twenty thousand dollars for just three weeks."
 I felt my eyes go wide at the idea of something so unbelievable happening to us, and then even wider as I realized this must be what Alec had been referring to.
 'Convince her it's fine for her to leave' indeed.
 He hadn't been kidding about getting us out of the country.
 "Mom, you have to go!
 This is the biggest opportunity ever!"
 She looked doubtful.

I’m telling you that I’m in love, and that’s a good thing.
 Jim – How did it happen?
 I mean, this afternoon you weren’t in love and now you are.
 Is it anyone I know?
 Art – Well, I met a pretty girl, we talked, and she didn’t run off screaming into the night.
 I found myself attracted to her, and enjoyed her company from the beginning.
 And since she didn’t run off screaming, and she did accept my invitation out for coffee, I got to know her better.
 I wonder if she’ll marry me.
 Jim – Damn.
 We’ll find out after you see how she reacts to you telling her about mom.

 "I wanted to be sure I had on enough for the t-shirt to absorb it."
 She kissed his neck.
 "Do you want me to heat up the food?"
 "I'm not hungry."
 She took a wonton and held it to his lips.
 "Sure?"
 He let her put it in his mouth, feeling her fingertips brush his lips.
 "Hmmm."
 He chewed and swallowed.

I tapped the tattoo and ask her if that was her boyfriend’s name.
 She leaned into me and whispered that it is just some guy who treats her like crap but she keeps going back to him.
 The fact that she chose to whisper that bit of information convinced me he was outside the open door.
 As we talked I described to her that I had a very controlling wife and two young children at home.
 I told her this because I needed to set some restrictive boundaries; I knew I would need to work within the confines of the narcotics officers, and this would allow me to put her off, buy some time, if I needed it.
 She talked with me and continued to massage my chest as she straddled my naked body.
 She reached for my hands and placed them on her young firm breasts.
 It was an unexpected treat for “an old guy with a script”.
 I’ll let you use your imagination from there, but she finished her massage and then we both got dressed.
 The fish was in the net.

She said she couldn’t drag herself out of bed when it was so gloomy.
 Marie decided she’d ask Grace to make her a waffle this morning.
 She’d like cherries and whipped cream on it.
 She’d go shopping with her mother and maybe have lunch in town.
 After lunch she’d come home to take a nap.
 The house would be hot in the afternoon.
 “Don’t forget to pick up the dry cleaning!” Marie jumped, looking up to see who’d yelled.
 A car door slammed, and she saw a sleek gray car back out of a driveway.

“Yes, milord.”
 Sergan turned and started barking orders, all his calm and politeness vanishing.
 The guard captain glanced at the edict from the king he carried in his hand.
 A rash impulse filled him, an insane desire to tear the paper to shreds and return to his liege bearing a lie on his lips.
 Under normal circumstances the king would know no difference.
 His advisors, however, were many, and every one of them would betray Antonil for the chance to gain esteem in the eyes of the king.
 No, he would have to deliver the message, regardless of his desires.
 He sighed one final time, turned toward his army, and began the march.

I rolled over, opened my eyes, groaning when I saw that the other side of the bed was empty.
 Who knew what Alec thought.
 He'd obviously fled his own room to avoid talking to me when I finally woke up.
 Donovan's gentle knock and appearance at the door pulled me up short before I could really get going on the self-loathing.
 "Good morning Mistress Paige, I hope you slept well."
 He limped into the room with his odd, somehow graceful lurch, and then set down a tray filled with eggs, French toast, orange juice and everything else you'd expect if you were to go to IHOP and order their 'everything but the kitchen sink' special.
 While I was still trying to catalog everything on the tray, Donovan laid out a full set of clothes, everything either in unopened manufacturer's plastic bags, or with price tags still attached.
 "Mistress Rachel thought you might desire a change of clothes seeing as how Master Alec carried you off without providing proper time for you to pack your things.
 I pray though that you not think too harshly of him.
 It was he who prepared your breakfast.

It started with accolades and awards for those early in their treatment and worked its way through the students by their personal achievements inching towards the finale of the three students set to “graduate” tonight.
 Everyone who was recognized for reaching a new level of their treatment was welcome to speak if they wished.
 Those who were in the program longer were more likely to do so, thanking others (both students and staff) for helping them through their most difficult challenges.
 Some were very emotional and some were humorous, all were heartfelt and meaningful descriptions of their individual challenges to reach that next level.
 It was clear that everyone here, whether they were staff or student, had the ability to impact anyone they touched.
 When the moment arrived for this evening’s three graduates to speak, a young lady in her early twenties walked to the front of the room with her head down.
 When she looked up, she smiled nervously.
 She had no family present.
 She told everyone how her mother told her how ugly she was her whole life and told her she was worthless, how she attempted to numb the pain with the drugs she took.
 How she became addicted to the drugs, and prostituted herself to pay for her habit.

“I’m so sorry,” he whispered to her.
 “Forgive me, please, if you can…”
 “What are you babbling about?” the elf asked, her eyes cracking open.
 Harruq tried to smile, but a sob came out instead.
 He hugged her, his forehead pressed against hers.
 “Help me up,” she said.
 Harruq did as commanded.
 When she was standing, he grabbed his blades and sheathed them.
 She leaned all her weight against him, and such close contact only deepened his guilt and anger.
 He knew she watched him, and he wiped away his tears as quickly and subtly as he could.

By the time I made it out to my car she'd called to tell me she wasn't hurt, just shaken up.
 So, in answer to your question, yes, everything's all right.
 I'm just a little unsettled."
 Lunch was an awkward affair.
 Britney was still upset.
 I, on the other hand, was extremely happy I'd made a good enough impression to get a job.
 I didn't like sitting there while Britney badmouthed Mrs. Campbell.
 I looked up during one of Britney's infrequent pauses for air, and caught Alec staring at me.
 Staring wasn't quite the right word though.
 Strangely enough, it didn't seem like he was necessarily mad, but he didn't seem happy either.

Some women in 1927 frequently showed cleavage, but not as much as she'd be showing in these bathing suits.
 And their legs weren't completely uncovered at the same time.
 Swallowing, she considered.
 If this was the norm, she could adjust.
 It wouldn't be easy, but she did want to go to the shore.
 Bravely she returned to the dressing room, took off her clothes and her binding, and put on the black bathing suit.
 It fit .
 .
 .
 she thought.

There were a lot of other, even worse things on the tip of my tongue, things I really wanted to say.
 For a moment, my anger warred with the fear of being completely friendless.
 I'd always thought I didn't need any friends, that I was fine making my own way.
 I was starting to realize I'd never really been alone before now.
 I'd always had the best friend a girl could've wanted.
 I'd just never recognized how much I'd depended on her.
 Even that oblique thought was almost too much.
 I felt my pulse quicken a little as the air seemed to vibrate.
 "Look, I'm sorry about how I reacted yesterday.
 I shouldn't have left you here like that."

“Wait Jason,” Emily called.
 “Dang, never mind.” She disappeared too.
 I went to follow her and hesitated.
 Seth walked up to me, “You nervous?” “Why shouldn’t I be?” I said, shaking.
 “Is going to a different world supposed to be vacation-relaxing-in-the-sun easy?” He smirked, “I never said that.” “You implied it,” I said, with a roll of my eyes.
 He sighed and pushed me into the doorway, the dark, swirling mist swallowing me up.
 I felt his hands leave my back for a second and then they were back.
 The chilly feeling welcomed me, like a long lost friend.
 As soon as the mist cleared, I was standing in a forest clearing.
 The sky was hazy and dreary, making me want to run back to Earth.

I was impatiently waiting when I finally saw one of the scraggly dressed officers wandered by pushing a grocery basket full of bags looking like a homeless person.
 He had an old torn jacket on with a beanie on his head.
 He was unshaven and looked the part of a vagrant.
 We had a moment of eye contact and he had no expression as if he didn’t know me at all.
 It was a slight reassurance but I still wondered where the rest of them were and how they would get to me quick if things went to Hell.
 I received another call from the officer and he had me speak so they could tune in the wire.
 He said that they needed to occasionally check the wire—from time to time I should say something to reassure them that they’d end up with a quality recording of the deal.
 The crack-berry rang and it was Ashley.
 She said her friend was reluctant to come to where I was because I was in a county where they were tough on crime and she wanted me to drive a couple of miles away and meet them at a grocery store.
 I told her again that I didn’t have much time and it was already past twenty minutes.

A boulder wearing a shirt.
 Gradually, my head tilted upward, and I blew my too-long bangs aside to peer up first at a strong chin, stern mouth, and then the darkest, deepest sapphire eyes I’d ever seen.
 Sure, lots of elves had blue eyes, but bright and shimmery.
 These were of the deepest blue.
 They must appear black in the shadows.
 The thought made me flush.
 I was staring into someone’s eyes.
 But as quickly as I had come upon him, he was gone.
 He turned from me without a word and disappeared in a few long strides.
 I watched him go.

“An elf,” Harruq whispered, managing to grab Qurrah’s attention.
 Now both peered around the corner, curious why such an exotic creature had arrived mere seconds before war.
 “Greetings, Dieredon,” the soldier hailed, pulling off his helmet.
 He was a middle-aged, blond-haired man who had numerous scars on his face.
 “Greetings to you as well, guard captain Antonil,” Dieredon said, taking a step back and kneeling.
 “Though I fear greetings is all I may offer you.”
 Antonil pointed to the wall, and he asked something which neither could hear when the orc army shouted another communal roar.
 “The Ekreissar will not aid you,” Dieredon said when the noise died.
 He shook his head, and a bit of sadness crossed his face.
 “We have been forbidden.

After Emily and I gave them a look, they tore down the street and disappeared.
 Emily squeezed the bottom of her shirt, “I hate them so much right now.” Water gushed onto the street.
 I wrung my hair out.
 “I agree and if we didn’t need them, I’d be planning their funeral.” Emily smiled, “I’d be helping you.
 Do you think they would like pink coffins?” “Totally,” I laughed and grabbed my dry bag.
 “Let’s go home.
 Want to crash at my place?” Emily flipped open her phone, her fingers danced on the keys and paused.
 Then they clicked and she shoved it in her pocket.
 “Yup I can.” “You’re always one step ahead.” “Always.” “So what do you think we should do?” Emily asked from my bed later on.
 I swallowed the bit of strawberry that had been in my mouth.

 Art – Such as?
 Jim – Being his legal guardian won’t be fun when he does something else really stupid, like the time that he…
 Art – I already told him, as a condition of our adopting him that that sort of thing would end, or the deal was off.
 Jim – Good, the other thing is Johnny himself.
 You know how Johnny is angry at the universe?
 Well Johnny doesn’t like Eugene.
 Actually Johnny seems to hate Eugene more than the rest of humanity on the whole.
 Art – That bad huh?
 Jim – Indeed it is.

"Look, I'm sorry about how I reacted yesterday.
 I shouldn't have left you here like that."
 Britney's voice was coated with sincerity, but it was the thinnest of layers, one which poorly disguised all kinds of nasty little feelings.
 On the other hand, it distracted my mind from the string of thoughts I'd otherwise have followed all the way down to a full-blown panic attack.
 It was a small thing in the grand scheme of the universe, but it was just enough to tilt the balance in her favor.
 I still didn't like her any more than she really liked me, but I was willing to tolerate her.
 To pretend we were friends so that neither of us had to face the scary world entirely on our own.
 "Okay, apology accepted.
 It wasn't very nice, but I suppose everyone makes mistakes."
 Britney's eyes grew bright, even after such a short acquaintance, I knew she was about to launch into a blow-by-blow account of the last twelve or so hours.

In fact, my life felt pretty much perfect right now.
 Wait, not quite.
 If he'd greeted me with a hug in addition to the smile, then things would have been perfect.
 I felt myself blushing almost as soon as the thought crossed my mind.
 My family wasn't...hadn't been demonstrative.
 I wouldn't know what to do if he hugged me.
 In an effort to cover my embarrassment, I turned back to Rachel and James, only to feel my jaw figuratively hit the ground.
 James was standing between Rachel and Brandon, slightly crouched in a posture that looked strangely familiar.
 I heard footsteps to my left as Brandon finished crossing the last few feet between us.
 James backed up a half step, one arm stretched out behind him, pushing Rachel back.

My jacket saved me from picking up any really serious scrapes this time, but just before I finished tumbling to a stop I slammed my head into a crescent-shaped rock.
 My vision swam in and out of focus, but I struggled to my feet, only to nearly fall again as my right ankle all but collapsed under me.
 They were definitely closer now.
 They'd stopped howling, but I could still hear them.
 I somehow found myself on my back again, looking up at the biggest wolf I'd ever seen.
 TV had given me the impression that a wolf shouldn't be much bigger than a German Shepherd.
 These guys were roughly the size of a small pony, one nearly black, the other more of a gray color, both with yellowish eyes, and lips pulled back to show teeth the size of my fingers.
 Most of my jeans had been torn away from my right calf, which was bleeding fairly profusely, but I didn't feel any pain.
 It was like my mind had finally torn loose from the moorings that usually held it in contact with reality.
 I was going to die, ripped to shreds by the same impossible animals that had killed the hikers a few months ago, but I just couldn't bring myself to care.

 He was that for you, even you, Creole (laughs)—he just is, like the moon.

 Like the Illuminati conspiracy.

Not surprisingly, there have been increasing indications of public discontent and voter dissatisfaction with the course of the reforms in the vast majority of countries.
 Simultaneous Shocks
 The collapse of the East European and Central Asian economies from 1990 to 1994 resulted from their exposure to a series of simultaneous shocks.
 1.Stabilization and adjustments: The majority of countries, having suffered from inflation and balance of payments problems in the 1980s, applied sharp stabilization and adjustment programmes in the early 1990s to stop inflation, balance budgets, and close balance of payments gaps, while at the same time liberalizing prices in order to correct major price distortions.
 These deflationary policies led, in most cases, to sharp declines in output.
 2.Resource allocation: Sudden dismantling of the central planning machinery responsible for the allocation of materials for current production and allocation of funds and materials for investment in these countries was another shock.
 It proved impossible in the majority of countries to create and organize, overnight, commodity and financial markets of sufficient depth and flexibility to substitute effectively for the planning machinery.
 3.Import liberalization: Drastic import liberalization led to the inflow of better-quality, lower-priced foreign goods that depressed demand for domestically produced goods.
 The shock impact of imports was aggravated by the fact that farmers in the region were forced to compete in some cases with subsidized agricultural products from the West.
 4.Privatization: Although the actual progress of privatization has been relatively slow in most instances, the uncertainty regarding the future status and ownership of enterprises and property has inhibited investment, slowed up current production, and led to widespread plunder of state property.

I mentally reviewed my conversation with the secretary, but couldn't remember either of us mentioning the class.
 As if trying to catch up in Algebra wasn't going to be bad enough, I was going to face the same kind of problem in physics.
 Grumbling to myself, I promised to try and switch into something better first thing tomorrow morning.
 The class was in a section of the building I hadn't been to yet, one apparently older than the rest of the building.
 The lights were spaced further apart and the cinder blocks in the walls were a slightly different size.
 Good thing I still had my water.
 The old part of the school was just as hot as the rest.
 You'd think functioning air-conditioning would be a necessity for a school so far south.
 At least it should cool down a little in the coming months.
 Assuming of course I lasted that long without losing it from dealing with all of the crazy small-town people in this school.

“Not done yet,” Qurrah said, sweat lining his face, his breathing soft and ragged.
 “There’re so many.
 So…‌many…”
 He closed his eyes.
 This time, he didn’t grab just one thread.
 He grabbed them all.
 They screeched and twisted in his grip.
 His head pounded, and the pull on his chest was so great he felt he might pitch over the wall to his death.
 Qurrah’s well of magic drained at frightening speed.
 He almost let go, but he thought of his brother, shaking under the spell of the skulls.

She opened the door.
 "Oh, I'm sorry, Father.
 I thought you were alone."
 "That's all right, my dear.
 Mr. Lawson and I were just concluding our business."
 He stood, addressing the young man who'd risen when Marie entered.
 "I don't believe you've met my daughter.
 Marie, this is Daniel Lawson.
 He's just bought that piece of land I'd intended to use for a warehouse a few years ago."
 Daniel smiled at Marie, shaking the hand she'd extended.

Ruby’s whip cracked in front of me and I knew the advance had gotten too far.
 And I was tied to a wall.
 Why hadn’t they killed me already?
 I waited for the flames.
 What came instead was far more excruciating.
 I expected to collapse as my body disconnected from my mind, but the vines held me in place.
 I saw a few final flickers of the battle before my eyes looked toward the sky, rolling back into my head.
 I had no way of forming a coherent thought or I might have been afraid.
 Chapter Seventeen A Fitting End
 I was surprised, in my dreams, that I wasn’t already dead.

 "That looks great."
 She was happy when he began eating with gusto.
 "What are we going to do today?"

 "Go to the shore again?"
 He groaned, pulling the blanket just low enough for her to be able to compare the skin his swimming trunks had covered with the red skin above it.

I guess only time would tell how things would go down and we prepared to head to Wal-Mart parking lot for the big bust.
 I personally would rather be shot at Nordstrom’s!
 Once in place at the store, I was contacted via my regular cell phone and I was told to make the call to Ashley and tell her where I would meet her in 20 minutes.
 The marked police cars were out of site and honestly I couldn’t see one officer, undercover or otherwise.
 The unmarked cars were apparently mixed into the parking lot full of cars.
 I made the call and Ashley answered quickly.
 I told her where I would be in twenty minutes (which was exactly where I was now).
 She immediately tried to get me to meet her at the apartment where she massaged me.
 I told her I had a brief window of time and I needed to pick up some items for my wife at the store so that was the only place and the only way I could meet them.
 She agreed and said she would see me soon.

Rodregas sat and watched as Doi’van and then Imeralda undertook the inscription of the minor sigil.
 From Rodregas’ perspective the next two seemed to withstand the pain a lot better than then he had.
 After all three were completed Imeralda used her magic to inscribe Jordaan.
 The healing sigil was the only sigil commonly used by magic users.
 A few were known to use sigils that improved memory or allowed one to store excess magic.
 After the sensation faded Rodregas felt no different than before.
 Rodregas had the feeling that Jordaan would have liked to keep the little frog; it was a powerful tool in the hands of an Elemental Healer like Jordaan, but Rodregas was not willing to give it up, and Jordaan never actually asked.
 The next morning they headed out for the Cathedral of Oravue.
 CHAPTER 13 A CHALLENGING PAST
 When they arrived at the Cathedral eight days later it was late in the afternoon.

“What do you say we water the horses?” I didn’t have to ask my horse to kneel; Steed just grabbed my waist and threw me up.
 He was mounted before I had settled into the saddle and our horses took off, galloping north in synchronization.
 I looked back for Chevelle.
 He was leaning forward, legs nearly straight in the stirrups as his stallion raced to catch us.
 We were covering distance so quickly I could barely take in the new surroundings.
 It wasn’t long before we came up on a wide creek.
 I assumed Steed had control of my horse; I was simply concentrating on staying in the saddle as we ran beside him.
 The horses edged closer to the creek, splashing along the muddy bank and then the shallows of the water.
 Silt and cold water sprayed my face as we ran.
 I wondered if this was what it felt like to fly like the fairies.

And Coltrane—everyone wanted to play like Coltrane, who credited acid with some of his wilder stuff—the stuff that was so influential.
 Pretty soon it was right there on albums, you know—psychedelia, via the laboratory.
 Psychedelic rock was just acid put to music, you know.
 Suddenly there were drug songs.
 “White Rabbit.”  “Amphetamine Annie.” “She Said She Said,” supposedly.
 Everyone thinks “Open Channel D” is about turning on, man, but, no, no, you get the reference.
 I mean, sure, open your mind, yeah, that’s psychedelia’s code-word.
 I wrote “Strawberry Fields for a While” on acid, appropriately.
 I mean, I did it on purpose.
 I wanted to answer John, send him a valentine as it was, and I thought, well, I should be tripping because that’s such a trippy song, you know?

 He kept staring at that guy’s face and blubbering, saying he didn’t mean to.
 That’s all he said, over and over.
 He didn’t mean to.
 He tried to stop.

"Good morning."
 She glanced out the window and realized she must have been sitting there for nearly 30 minutes.
 "Have you been out to the garden already?"
 "No."
 She stood and went to him.
 "I want to go home--" "I know, sweetheart."
 He caressed her hair, wishing he knew how to comfort her.
 "I want to go home, but I also want to go to Hollywood."
 He chuckled.
 "Do you want to cut out the walk in the garden until we get back?"

Of course, the Daemon Lords love to tempt all those of Celestial blood.
 I was born a bastard from an illicit affair of such a temptation.
 While the shape my father had taken had been fair, I came out, well let’s just say my paternity was not in question.” “This is an old game among my people,” Doi’van continued “and while I suffered much in my own clan, they kept me in the palace and I grew to adulthood in its strong magical confines and to my full strength.” “So,” Imeralda broke in, “You are of both Infernal and Celestial blood?” Doi’van seemed hesitant to answer for a moment but after a long pause said, “Yes, but most choose not to see it that way.
 You are either Hellborn or not.
 After I grew to manhood, I decided my true place was among one of the other clans, one that follows the lordship of the Hellborn.” He spoke this very slowly each deep rumble of his tone dragged out.
 “I was wrong though, and quickly realized that those who follow the Lords of the Infernal Realms were even a worse fit for me than at home, though they did see me as royal blood and not tainted.” Doi’van added, “I eventually decided to start somewhere new and took a ship across the inland sea.” Doi’van paused at this and shook his head, his hair flying wild, as he seemed to want to shake out a memory from his massive head before he continued.
 “I am afraid I did not ask enough questions.
 I just wanted to get a fresh start.
 I was in Guild Dealer Taigas’ Menagerie to be sold within a week of my arrival.” He finished, his smile fading at the memory.
 “When was that?” Rodregas asked.

“No elf will save you.
 No one!”
 “Why this hatred?” she asked, smacking away a dual thrust.
 “When have I shown you anything but kindness?”
 Harruq gave her no answer.
 Instead, he stabbed with Salvation, a higher thrust of Condemnation trailing behind it.
 Aurelia turned her staff horizontal and pushed upward.
 Both swords stabbed high above her head.
 A quick turn and one end of her staff rammed the half-orc in the gut.
 The blow knocked the wind out of Harruq.

He shoved a few men aside, tore through the center of his army, and then emerged at the back.
 Far down the street, his robe flowing in a nonexistent wind, walked a pale man dressed in black.
 His low hood covered all but the chin of his face.
 His gait was slow and steady.
 He kept one hand outstretched, and from it flowed a black river that branched out to form the shield that had kept the men alive.
 No arrows fired.
 The battle was at a standstill, all because of this mysterious stranger who walked so calmly down the street.
 “Men of Neldar!” this man screamed, sounding like a giant among mortal humans.
 “Some of you are meant to die this day.
 Rejoice, for your souls will leave this mortal coil in the glory of combat.

"Microwave oven."
 He smiled.
 "It depends on what you want."
 He made them a salad and put two frozen lasagna dinners in the microwave.
 It wasn't the best lunch he could offer a guest from the 1920s, but it was the only thing he could think of to prepare in the microwave.
 Marie seemed fascinated by it.
 "Lasagna in ten minutes.
 Incredible."
 She touched a forkful to her tongue, finding that it was too hot.
 She blew it and then tasted it.

Frost beasts don’t appear until the end of fall and into winter.
 They love the cold and can’t stand the heat.
 That’s why I knew something was wrong right away, because it shouldn’t have been here.
 It was against its nature and when nature goes wrong, that’s a big sign.
 I pulled back on the string but Emily ran forward and shot fire.
 The beast simply opened its mouth and breathed.
 What was a shot of fire was now a single icicle that landed on the ground in front of it.
 Instead Jason came forward and attacked with his knives.
 The beast froze the first few into harmless ice cubes but finally went down when one got past its defenses.
 Behind his body appeared seven Thrashers and many more Frost beasts.

"What?"
 "Let's go in here."
 He led her into a large department store and began searching for ladies' lingerie.
 While Marie looked around at all the lacy, sometimes colorful articles, Rick found a saleslady.
 "My friend over there, for reasons I won't go into, may not know her sizes.
 Will you help her find a couple of bras and some underwear?"
 "Of course--I'll take care of her."
 The lady could tell Marie's underwear size with no problem.
 But when Marie came out of the dressing room complaining that the 32B was too tight, she wondered how she'd missed the girl's bust size by such a margin.
 Marie found that she loved shopping for modern lingerie.

“I have honored your will, my lord,” he said.
 “But it is time I honor my men.”
 From his belt, he took a white horn bearing the symbol of Neldar.
 He put this ancient horn to his lips and blew.
 All throughout Woodhaven rumbled the signal to retreat.
 He gave the signal two more times before clipping the horn back to his belt and hobbling north.

Liz – It would cost too much money.
 Jim – We could hold a fund raiser.
 Johnny – Is that the best you can come up with?
 Jim – What’s wrong with the idea?
 Liz – Think long and hard for a minute about all the people Gene has pissed off over the years.
 How many of them do you think would donate money to help him out.
 Jim – Point made.
 Well isn’t there some sort of loophole we can take advantage of?
 Liz – We looked.
 The only thing that comes close is a clause that makes the whole argument null and void if Eugene’s father dies.

In order to prepare a cadre of managers for private sector industry and institutions, specialized institutes of management should be set up in each country.
 8.Launch a massive programme to impart new skills and attitudes to the population: In countries where private enterprise was extinguished for decades, entrepreneurial, financial and marketing skills can be extremely limited.
 An analysis should be undertaken of the types and levels of skills needed for transition to a market system, covering areas such as entrepreneurship, management, national and international marketing, strategic business planning, finance, quality control, product development, production technology, design, and human resource development.
 Experience in former colonial nations where entrepreneur ship was also stifled for a long period indicates that a profound change in attitude is necessary before people will risk leaving or forego seeking salaried and pensioned jobs in favour of self-employment, even when the salaried jobs are scarce or unavailable.
 Such a basic change of attitude, which normally requires a change of generation, can be accelerated by a massive programme of public information, education and demonstration spanning several years.
 9.Study the benefits of economic recovery on world trade: Recessionary trends are affecting many parts of the world today.
 The prognosis in the West, especially in the European Union, is for slow growth during the 1990s.
 The progress of developing countries is impeded by slow growth in the industrialized nations and the collapse of Eastern Europe.
 What would be the impact on the world economy of a rapid recovery and economic expansion in the countries of the region?
 What would be the result elsewhere of further decline in Eastern Europe?

 Her smile lit her face.

 "Yeah.

Are you high right now?” Spittle lands on his face; he blinks but does not flinch.
 “Bryce, go search your brother’s room.
 Now!” Brandon stood up to leave, but Harry stood up from his dining room chair and went towards him and so did Lisa.
 They asked Brandon to sit back down on the overstuffed chair and he did.
 “He won’t find anything in there,” Brandon mumbled.
 A few minutes later, Bryce rounded the corner into the room with his arms outstretched cupping the Oxy and foil he found inside CD cases.
 I had never even thought to check there.
 Brandon stood up.
 Bryce glared into Brandon’s eyes, and in the room’s dead silence Bryce laid the drugs and the burned black-sketched foil on the counter like it was a dead animal.
 I stood in front of Brandon, looking slightly up at him, as he is taller than me.

The half-orc opened his mouth and then closed it.
 A boy’s face flashed before his eyes.
 _You’re an orc, aren’t you?_
 “Yes,” he said at last.
 “I’ve killed.”
 He eyed Aurelia, desperately wishing to know what she thought yet unable to figure out why he even cared.
 He thought he saw pity in her eyes, perhaps compassion.
 But there was a hardness there, a doubting that made him wonder just how much of him she truly knew.
 “Tell me of the first time,” she said.
 He shook his head.

Jim kicked in my amp.
 I was dumbfounded—he was like some shaman so I didn’t protest—and that hole in the amp is what gives my guitar such a weird sound on that cut.
 I had a fuzz pedal too—a Pep box, and an Astrotone, but, Jim wanted that Memphis thing, you know, he wanted to tie us into the whole mojo, from Sun, from Ike Turner, through Keith Richards on “Satisfaction”—which is a cop from Sam, don’t let anyone tell you different, through the swamp music of Mudboy—up to us.
 At this time, remember, I was like attached to the guitar, man.
 I could make an electric guitar sing, talk, chant, name your baby.
 It was just natural.
 So, yeah, I got a reputation—they started mentioning my name alongside Beck and Page and you know the list.
 I was airborne, man.

After we first met—at her apartment—she called me several times just to get a few pills to hold her over until we could meet for this drug deal.
 I have refused her every time as I have told her that we will meet just the one time and exchange all the drugs for the money at once.
 She has tried to entice me with her young body in exchange for a couple Oxy, but I have resisted the temptation.
 The first time Ashley and I met I had the pleasure of seeing her naked body, but my goal is not to see it again, my goal is to do this drug deal.
 Her actions highlight that she is seriously addicted and that is not comforting when I am taking her word that Steve is a trustworthy drug dealer, as if there is such a thing.
 Another car approaches and it is white, but I cannot tell the make of the vehicle.
 As it passes, I check it out and see that it is a woman with two small children.
 She is handing a baby bottle towards a car seat in the back.
 A young boy sitting in the front passenger seat stares back at me as if to say, “What are you looking at?” I was once that baby in the backseat and my brother that inquisitive one in the front.
 My father wouldn’t have been in the car either.

I felt my face go hot with embarrassment.
 I tried to step behind a pillar before he saw me go bright red, but knew I hadn't succeeded.
 I bit my lip as I realized how spastic I was being.
 I'd spent the last sixteen-plus years suppressing my natural tendency to form crushes on one cute boy after another.
 I'd nearly perfected the art of exhibiting zero interest in the opposite sex.
 The whole point of my existence had been avoiding the kinds of things that'd result in everyone laughing at me.
 Why was I setting my sights on a boy who was so far out of my league?
 Even if there'd been a chance he might like me, I had absolutely no idea how to proceed.
 Given the option, I would've just hid behind the pillar until everyone left for class, but Britney had made her decision, and was paying for her food.
 Essentially out of time, I took a deep breath and followed her to a table.

There was no way I could've known that the gray monster who casually sliced through walls and two-by-fours with his wickedly curved claws was Brandon, but I was somehow certain.
 He was built just like Alec had been Friday night, only so much bigger that he had to crouch forward to avoid hitting his head on the unusually high ceilings.
 Donovan faced off against one of the first wolves, but it was obvious he was no match for the grace and power of his opponent.
 The gentle, aging butler was knocked to the ground between one heartbeat and the next.
 I was mercifully spared from seeing the wreckage left when Brandon's wolves moved on, but there was no doubt in my mind that Donovan was dead.
 Screams, distant enough that they had to be coming from the other wing of the house, reached out and pierced my heart.
 There wasn't any way to be sure whether or not it was Rachel or her mother, but ultimately it didn't really matter.
 Brandon was going to kill all of us.
 Another door caved in under a blow from Brandon's fist, and I suddenly realized that he was now standing in the Lilac Room.
 "Spread out and find her."

Just as the present efforts of the UN to make and keep the peace are severely constrained by the lack of a standing professional military force under its own direction, so also the prodigious efforts of the UN’s development agencies to accelerate development among member countries is hampered by a lack of well-trained, disciplined and highly organized personnel for implementation, especially in those countries with the greatest need of assistance.
 The Commission recommends that, as a complement to the establishment of an International Force for Peace, an International Force for Development be constituted, comprised of former military personnel who, after appropriate training, will work to accelerate economic development to provide food, health, literacy and jobs for all.
 A UN Peace Force and UN Development Force, functioning under a democratically restructured UN, can make a lasting contribution to achieving the major goals of the UN system.
 Conclusion
 Seven years ago the threat of nuclear war between the superpowers loomed large in the minds of people everywhere.
 The euphoria generated by the end of the Cold War led to high expectations of peace and a ‘peace dividend’ the world over.
 Yet excitement soon turned to disappointment as the full anticipated results of these magnificent accomplishments did not immediately materialize.
 Then, as attention turned to more mundane problems closer to home, the sense of relief and celebration was replaced by growing concern over the increasing prominence of other threats to international security: some of these were aggravated by the new positive developments, while others had not previously seemed so serious by comparison with the threat of nuclear annihilation.
 The end of political confrontation between East and West, the sudden conversion of authoritarian communist states into demo cratic market economies, and substantial cuts in global defence spending were accompanied by increasing political instability and ethnic violence in the many parts of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, by the horren dous loss of life due to civil and ethnic strife in several African countries, by growing concern over drugs and violent crime in the West, by the danger of nuclear terrorism resulting from potential theft of Soviet weapons, and by pressure on defence producers to compensate for reduced domestic defence budgets by increasing arms exports.
 This surprising turn of events has led some to re-examine the incredible achievements of the period and conclude that they were either vastly overstated or, perhaps, even illusory.

 When a breeze stirred the curtains, she realized that it was just the heat of a late July afternoon.
 She'd become accustomed to air conditioning.
 She needed to go bathe and put on some shorts and-- No, she didn't have shorts in 1927, she reminded herself.
 Well, she'd have to put on her thinnest cotton dress.
 She'd like to just keep Rick's t-shirt on.
 No, she thought, stripping it off.
 She didn't want to get her own perspiration on it.

It is not just advances in technology that work in this fashion.
 Every major advance in social attitudes, institutions, values and lifestyles has a dual effect on employment, creating jobs in some areas and destroying them in others.
 Higher standards of education not only raise productivity, but also stimulate higher expectations that lead to greater consumption.
 Changing attitudes toward the environment have created entirely new industries and generated new jobs in every field where impact on the environment is of concern.
 New types of organization such as fast-food restaurants, franchising and hire purchase or leasing create new jobs by hastening the growth or expanding the activities of the society.
 Shifting attitudes toward marriage and the role of women create greater demand for jobs but also more opportunities for employment, because working women consume more and require additional services.
 Anxiety regarding the impact of technological development on jobs has been aggravated by the belief – largely a hangover from the Industrial Age – that in the industrial nations automation is rapidly replacing high-wage manufacturing jobs with low-wage jobs in the service sector.
 Actually, services have had a dominant place in Western economies for most of the twentieth century.
 In the United States, they now account for 79 per cent of all jobs, 74 per cent of GDP, and generate a $56 billion trade surplus, compared to a $132 billion deficit for goods.
 Technological developments, such as advances in computers, telecommunications and medical technology, have played at least as great a role in the growth of the service sector as in manufacturing.

“And quiet, before you wake him.”
 “Too late,” said a voice from the stairs.
 Both turned to see Ahrqur standing at the top step, his arms crossed.
 He was dressed in a long green robe.
 Silver swirls marked the sleeves and front.
 Brown hair fell far past his shoulders.
 “Pleased to meet you,” Harruq said with a bow.
 “Indeed,” Qurrah said, his hand itching to retrieve his whip curled underneath his raggedy robe.
 “If you are thieves, you are certainly incompetent ones,” Ahrqur said, his voice full of contempt.
 He descended halfway down the stairs, his eyes never leaving the two.

I kept looking at the clock, and the later it got, the more certain I was that Principal Gossil was just about to get on the loudspeaker and call out the winners of the drawing.
 The last two minutes of lunch dragged on forever, but then the bell rang and I was left sitting stunned as Brandon and his friends stood to go.
 I let Brandon help me to my feet, hardly noticing the way his touch left my hand tingling, and headed off to class.
 It was stupid, but I couldn't help feeling this was yet another sign I wasn't going to win a ticket.
 I tried to shake the feeling during History, but was still fighting it when I walked into Physics.
 In a departure from his normal routine, Alec was already seated when I arrived.
 I flipped open my notebook and tried to distract myself with a brief sketch, only to tear the page out and ball it up as the bell rang.
 I looked up to see Alec staring at me, which just made me mad.
 It was completely unfair.
 I wasn't going to get to go to Les Misérables, but he was rich enough to fly to New York and book the whole theater.

 "I'll have my lawyer send you the papers, Mr. Lawson," Jefferson Tranton said.
 He showed his guest out and then returned to kiss his daughter's cheek before sitting down behind his desk.

 "Thank you.
 I didn't mean to interrupt.
 I didn't think you were going to be doing business at home this morning."
 "Young Lawson is eager to close the deal as quickly as possible.

From how long it took them to unload my most recent food shipment, he won't be back anytime soon, and I'm certainly not planning on telling him.
 Are you going to let our little cat out of the bag?"
 I started to shake my head, but honesty prevailed before I could finish the motion.
 "I mean I'm not planning on it, but I'm not very good at lying or keeping secrets.
 Especially not from Alec."
 Mallory's chuckle was that of a much younger woman.
 "That bothers you a little, doesn't it?"
 "Sometimes.

“ _Hemorrhage._ ”
 A sudden purging of blood vessels exploded across Ahrqur’s side.
 The force smashed him into a decorative table.
 He rolled off the broken thing and glanced down at the blood soaking his robe.
 Despite the wound, no cut or hole was visible in the cloth.
 “You are pathetic, Ahrqur,” Qurrah said, his hands whirling.
 “You are skilled but you are soft.
 You lack spirit, will.
 It is why you cannot resist my power.
 _Hemorrhage!_ ”

Death.
 The official ruling was death by asphyxiation, choking on his own vomitus.
 It began to seem coroners handed this out to rock stars by rote.
 Janis and Jimi set the standard; anything less would be unseemly, not up to snuff.
 Next to his naked body were the cliché syringe, bottle of Jack Daniels and a sheet of lyrics, a half-finished song to be called, apparently, “Wendy Ward Redux,” as if at the end he tried to return to past glories and died trying.
 The penultimate line read, “You left your coppery skin behind.”  The final line, though difficult to decipher, seems to say, “Come back to me—“ and the last word is either “you” or “youth.” Either way a sad epitaph.
 But Buddy’s gone gone.
 It’s a sure thing.
 He burned brightly once but then seemed to just peter out like the Sixties itself, like a wind-up thing of wonder, a mechanical play-pretty.
 He ran down.

 Instead his face had gotten tight and remote.
 For a second it seemed like he was looking right through me.

 "Of course.
 That's an easy comeback.

I’m fighting elves.
 You’re one of them.
 No simpler than that.”
 “Liar.”
 Harruq snarled, the elf inside him all but invisible.
 He charged, recklessly hacking at Aurelia.
 “Why do we fight?” she asked again, desperately trying to block every swing.
 Blood covered her arms, and another swing cut through her dress, slicing into the beautiful flesh of her leg.
 “Why, Harruq?
 Why!”

And that after living with him, she decided that men weren’t for her.
 He never lived it down.
 Nobody in the family would let him live it down.
 We teased him all the time about it.
 Art – Has he shot himself yet?
 Or someone else?
 Karen – Not yet.
 Actually last I heard he was married again and they have two kids.
 Art – Well he seems to have bounced back from all the pain and humiliation, he must be a resilient young man.
 Karen – Well, he did leave the home first.

Rick opened the door.
 "I saw the light on and wondered if something was wrong."
 He stepped closer.
 "You're crying!
 What's wrong?"
 "Nothing new.
 I-I'm frightened, Rick."
 He gazed down into those huge, shimmering hazel eyes and felt his heart melt.
 "It'll be all right, sweetheart."
 He sat down on the edge of the bed and drew her into his arms.

Given the tight leash he kept his beast on, I would have been willing to bet that just about anyone else in the pack would have already shifted shapes and ripped a tree out of the ground or done something equally destructive by now.
 Alec shifted the phone slightly, I couldn't hear whoever was on the other end anymore, but whatever they'd just said hadn't made things any better.
 The invisible ants marching up my arms went to double time and the metaphysical breeze that started on his skin and went outward turned into a full-blown gale.
 "Stall them.
 We'll be down in eight minutes if worse comes to worst you two contain Isaac and tell Dom to sit on Jack.
 Keep Rachel out of the way."
 Already moving with the unearthly speed he normally concealed even from me, Alec hung up the phone and started throwing things into the backpack.
 "Jack's working himself up to a dominance fight with Jess.
 This couldn't have happened at a worse time.
 If we're not back before it starts odds are someone's going to die."

They couldn’t meet anyone’s eyes; their pinpoint pupils darted around the room when I spoke to them.
 They couldn’t answer simple questions coherently.
 They babbled and told those outrageous stories.
 They were sick.
 When my wife and I heard sirens or the phone rang late at night, we always thought the worst.
 Certain police or crime television shows would give us lumps in our throats as we would silently look at each other and know we were thinking the same thing… that might be our son.
 One afternoon while I was at work, Lisa was trying to help Brandon out by organizing some of his bills.
 Brandon told her that he needed to run a quick errand.
 She called me later that day and said she had lost track of him and he wasn’t returning her calls or answering his phone.
 All the usual horrible thoughts began to surface in our minds.

I say, “Red Dodge Charger approaching at one o’clock,” attempting not to move my lips, as the vehicle is coming almost directly towards me on my right.
 The Dodge slows almost to a stop just a couple of car lengths away.
 I am unable to see in the tinted windows of the car but I am certain they can see me; I stare back as if to say, “Is that you?” They are obviously aware that I am there, alone and awaiting their arrival.
 The car slowly pulls away after taking a good look at me.
 I lose sight of them, as they seem to be going towards the opposite end of the parking lot.
 I assume they will pull around after checking out the surroundings but instead my crack-berry rings within seconds.
 It is Ashley and she is trying to move me to a Starbucks that is on the other side of the same parking lot.
 I resist and ask her if that was her that stopped next to me in the red Dodge Charger.
 She says it was but she would rather meet at the Starbucks where there are some people around.
 I tell her to just come to my truck and let’s get this deal done.

I was thinking of Chevelle’s loss, of my own, and now of Ruby’s.
 How could we all be without family?
 “Your mother…” I trailed off.
 He sighed.
 “My mother died years ago, with a large part of the northern clans.” I cringed.
 His mother had died because of my mother.
 The same as Chevelle.
 I was almost afraid to ask.
 “And your father?” He smiled.
 “My father wanders the mountain… killing fairies.” My jaw dropped.

the Memphis Jones?
 Yeah, yeah.
 It’s just a city, in some ways, just another stop, but, in other, more profound ways, it’s like a spell, a magical place that conjures music and feeling and, oh, what?
 a sort of inbred homegrown soul.
 But, its’ the inbred that’s dangerous, right?
 Like a cancer, or like unrequited love.
 All angels are dangerous, Rilke said.
 Memphis is an angel, a city of angels.
 I miss it.

He saw the face of his master, and the sick grin there horrified him.
 “I will not die!” he shrieked.
 “I will not die!”
 His flesh burned in fire, his bones blew away as dust on the wind, and only an empty robe remained of the being that was Velixar.
 Yet, still haunting the wind, was his final cry, a promise to the world of Dezrel.
 _“I will not die!”_

While they were able to move the dirt and debris out, it was still just bare walls and stone floors.
 After a brief meal, Rodregas headed over to the main house.
 Rodregas admitted to himself that he was nervous.
 The Dire Cats where magnificent beasts.
 He had no desire to hurt them, and less to be killed by them; but was unsure of how they could share the farm with them.
 Like the barn, the house was made of perfect cut stone that looked almost new; everything else had gone back to nature.
 Rodregas circled around to the back where the stone steps led to the cellar.
 He was sure that originally that there had had doors covering the entrance, but of course, they were long gone.
 Rodregas smelled what he would find well before he came around the corner.
 Next to the entrance was the corpse of a large bear which had recently been killed and partly eaten.

But a song, you know, a good song, well, it does tunnel deep into the consciousness.
 Did I think I could do anything with the right words, well-placed, well-played?
 No.
 No, I knew better.
 But, I did think—I do think—that we had to stand for something other than pop ditties, you dig?
 The people who needed help—well, it was all so fucking clear then—AIM and the draft dodgers and the blacks and, Jesus, I mean, if you couldn’t see the problem you really were part of the problem.
 So, seeing it, what does one do?
 What could one do?
 Power, in the end, is just another word, too, but the power is gonna belong to someone, so, in the end, who decides?
 Who decides Nixon has more power than Mao, or John Lennon has more power than Roy Cohn?

This led to the invention of systematic education as a method to pass on acquired knowledge and skills to the next generation and thereby continuously increase them.
 The Ultimate Resource
 These rich and varied discoveries came as the result of a careful observation and analysis of the external world around us, an infinite exploration and experimentation with things, an endless trial and error blending of minerals and plants to forge metals and produce medicines.
 As a result, for millennia we have tended to overlook or, at best, grossly underestimate the greatest of all resources and the true source of all the discoveries, inventions, creativity and productive power found in nature – the resource that has made minerals into ships that sail the skies, fashioned grains of sand into tiny electronic brains, released the energy of the sun from the atom, modified the genetic code of plants to increase their vigour and productivity – the ultimate resource, the human being.
 World Food Prize recipient and father of India’s milk revolution, Dr V. Kurien, has decried the tendency to credit external factors for the accomplishment of people.
 ‘It is the farmer that has produced this miracle, not the cow.’ And so it can be said of the Industrial Revolution and the Green Revolution.
 Looked at from a different perspective, the entire evolution of civilization is a progressive act of humanity’s self-discovery.
 At each stage of external observation and exploration, people have discovered more of their own inner capacity for resourcefulness.
 The material, technological, political, economic and social development of the world over countless centuries is an external expression of the growing discovery by humanity of the unlimited creative power of mental ideas, emotional aspirations, physical skills and higher values.
 The real process of creation and development is from the immaterial to the material, from the inner to the outer, from idea to invention, from aspiration to achievement, from the lofty value of freedom and the ideal of self-determination to the founding of democratic nations, from the soaring emotions of an emperor’s love to the beauty and grandeur of the Taj Mahal, from the urge for adventure to the discovery of a new continent, from the technician’s joy in expressing perfect skill to the marvellous powers of a microprocessor.

We made small talk and all too soon arrived at school.
 As we pulled into the parking lot I was desperately looking for something witty or insightful to say.
 I needed to give him a reason to stay interested in me, but nothing came to mind.
 As we pulled to a stop, the quiet hum of a cellphone on vibrate broke the strange paralysis that'd gripped me for the last twenty seconds.
 Brandon's grin was more than a little sheepish as he fished his phone out of a front pocket and checked to see who was calling.
 I didn't need his groan to know it was one of his friends.
 A selfish urge to try and make him ignore the call and continue to focus on me momentarily flared up, but I suppressed it.
 It was such a petty thing to do, and even worse was probably the quickest way to demolish whatever interest he might have towards me.
 I might be almost completely naive when it came to dating, but anyone who'd read more than a couple books, or sat through eight or nine chick flicks, totally knew that the quickest way to drive a guy off was to become controlling and manipulative.
 Unless maybe you were a cheerleader and you were talking about a guy who was used to dating cheerleaders.

 She didn't know very much about making love, but if it was even better than the way Rick had kissed her and caressed her last night .

 She shivered.
 She would give anything to be able to make love with Rick.
 Well, almost anything.
 She had to go home.
 She jumped when she heard Rick's door open.
 Glancing at him, she turned and headed downstairs.

I waited for the flames.
 What came instead was far more excruciating.
 I expected to collapse as my body disconnected from my mind, but the vines held me in place.
 I saw a few final flickers of the battle before my eyes looked toward the sky, rolling back into my head.
 I had no way of forming a coherent thought or I might have been afraid.
 Chapter Seventeen A Fitting End
 I was surprised, in my dreams, that I wasn’t already dead.
 For a long time, there was no sound, only those disjointed images.
 When the sound came, there was something else wrong.
 It was like… like I wasn’t alone.

It wasn't until his arm brushed me that I realized he was shaking ever so slightly himself.
 "There's only one way you're going to touch her, James.
 Are you really ready to take that step?"
 I felt shivers run down me as I realized just how easily everything could boil over into deadly violence.
 The tension in the room pulsed out in waves, skittering many-legged across my skin like something that belonged under a rock somewhere.
 The feeling intensified even more as first Jessica and then Jasmin picked up the same strange, near epileptic quiver.
 James let out a low, grating growl, and my stomach dropped as he looked up with eyes that weren't the unremarkable brown they'd been just a second before.
 The hot yellow eyes of a predator were looking out of James' familiar face, changing it into something threatening and inhuman.
 Answering growls from Jasmin and Jessica seemed to snap something inside of Alec.
 His tremble became more pronounced.

But, if you listen, that is, if you can read between the lines here, you’ll find, not only an extraordinary document, but one that could only come from the personalities involved.
 The voices are theirs.
 The story is theirs, even as it belongs to a generation.
 Let us hearken back, briefly, to those days when music was being made because it was important, because genius finds its own level, because people needed godhead, if that’s not overstating it.
 Before the drugs, the recriminations, the lawsuits, the doubting of the very fiber of what the 60s meant to Memphis, to these sweet souls herein, and to the world at large.
 Let us reimagine it, if we can, in all its efflorescence.
 In all its pied beauty.
 Let’s hear again, “Turntable Poison” as if for the first time and marvel at the voice that said, “We are all naked.”  That said, “Love me for my limo but love me all the way.”  And, that said, presciently, “Death is only a way station, between West Memphis and the coast.” These interviews were done in three sessions in early 1973, in San Francisco, by Creole Myers, at Buddy Gardner’s home.
 Lorelei Enos was in and out.
 One of the startling revelations found in these tapes is that Lorelei was with Buddy until the end.

 Cleo – I never did anything, those are all lies made up by your father to turn you against me!
 I never touched either of those men.
 I was faithful to your father!
 Liz – I have pictures.
 Cleo – You little sneak!
 Well your father has been cheating on me too, with his secretaries, since just a little while after you were born.
 Liz – I’ve got pictures of that as well.

Rodregas stumbled for a moment, but was running almost, even as he caught himself.
 Imeralda was stepping forward with the dagger to finish Van’dret, but he caught her arm and said, “Wait.
 Stop, let me.
 He should be as strong as I am.
 Let me and Doi’van get in close.” She hesitated, but nodded and handed her dagger to him.
 Doi’van pounded past the two and picked Van’dret off the ground, by the front of his robes, and gave him a backhanded slap across the face.
 It was with enough power to have snapped a normal man’s neck, but Van’dret looked more startled than hurt.
 “Gag him and don’t let him move his fingers,” said Imeralda.
 Even as Doi’van nodded he slapped his open palm against Van’dret’s mouth and used his other hand to grab one of the sorcerer’s free hands.
 Rodregas grabbed the other.

“How much I wish for your pride to suffer.” Magical energy rippled out of him and tore across the air.
 The elf whirled, sensing the incoming invisible blow.
 Only a tiny part hit his shoulder, immediately encasing it in ice.
 Then Harruq was upon him, slashing recklessly.
 Ahrqur batted his sword left and right, then jumped as Harruq swung back in a scissor-cut that should have shredded his waist.
 The elf landed atop one of his couches, balancing with ease.
 “What reason do you have to kill me?” the elf asked.
 “Are you here for money?
 I could pay you twice the pittance you work for.”
 “Just shut up,” Harruq said, hurling Salvation across the room.

Velixar laughed as they pierced into his stomach and chest.
 No blood ran from them.
 “You must do far better than that,” he said, his fingers hooked in strange positions.
 Another blast of dark power washed over Dieredon.
 He felt his right shoulder crack into fragments.
 Darkness swam before his eyes, darkness dominated by twin red orbs.
 The elf reached into a small pocket of his armor and drew out a glass vial.
 “Healing potions will not aid you,” Velixar mocked.
 “This is no healing potion,” Dieredon said.
 He threw the vial.

We spent an hour or so on an art project they were creating.
 They intended to draw a million small circles, just to see what a million looked like.
 Taking turns, we drew about 20,000.
 Evelyn, their mom, kept appearing, offering food.
 Sometime before dark I left and wandered alone, toward and up a hill called Eastridge that overlooked our school, along a street of vacant lots, sometimes escaping into in my usual obsessions about Karen Flagstad or whether I should play baseball or golf that spring.
 But after a moment, the truth returned.
 Nothing that mattered yesterday mattered anymore.
 My gut felt as if a big snake were coiled inside it.
 My heart was a huge lump of coal.
 I walked faster and groaned and wondered why I couldn’t weep.

The two-story mansion was beautifully painted and decorated.
 The sides of the building were a deep brown, like the trunk of an ancient tree.
 The roof jutted out far past the walls.
 It was the color of wet leaves.
 Many windows decorated the front, all covered with silken curtains.
 The fence surrounded the entire property, black iron spiked ten feet at the top.
 “How do we get in?” Harruq asked.
 Qurrah examined the fence, his face locked in a frown.
 “I don’t know.
 I have no spells that can aid us.”

But she did tell more about her duties in the castle.
 Her father must have ruled a vast kingdom.
 And she was his second.
 I heard someone in the front room and knew I had read through the night again.
 I hurriedly slipped the book into my pack and pretended to sleep.
 Ruby was waking me minutes later to head out to the ridge.
 Chapter Fourteen Traveling
 The group was waiting for us when we crossed over the ridge, down to the site where we had spent so many days and nights.
 If I hadn’t been so exhausted from lack of sleep, I would have probably been nervous.
 As it was, I blindly followed Ruby as we gathered and eventually mounted to leave.

I guess panic attacks are harder on your system than most people realize.
 My body had already started spiraling down to an attack again, but before I could get too wobbly, I made it inside the house.
 Mom met me at the bottom of the creaking stairs with a big smile on her tired face.
 "The view from the rooms as the sun starts to set is even better than I thought it would be.
 Coming here was the best idea we've ever had."
 Normally Mom's enthusiasm was fairly catching.
 You expect that kind of energy in a child; when it comes from an adult it's hard not to react in kind.
 It didn't manage to infect me this time, but it did help focus me on the here and now.
 I figured I owed her for that, so I tried to suppress my generally ungracious nature.
 I even let her lead me up the creaky stairs to show me the 'amazing view' for the third time.

Reba, a truck stop veteran, had eyes for Cliff, though she was twice his age.
 She was toying with his hair when sweet Helga came in and gasped.
 She fetched a Bible from her cubby and read aloud, “Her lips drip honey, but in the end she is a bitter fruit.
 Her steps lead straight to the grave.” Reba laughed and sat in the chair between Cliff and me.
 She arched her back so her breasts swelled.
 “Helga, last night I took your advice.
 I said, ‘God, help me out here.
 Don’t let temptation lure me down to the Inn Spot again.’” Helga beamed, and leaned across the table.
 “You stayed home?
 Tell me you stayed home?” “Well, I stayed home all right, but that’s not the whole story.

And I sang it again.
 It was just heart wrenching, man, I mean, we were just like two kids given a new lease on life.
 I wrote a song, I kept, thinking.
 I wrote a damn good song.
 I was back, you know, back, but different.
 Different but the same.
 This is what I want everyone to understand.
 What I want to say—the difference is not a drama, the difference is a poem, a song, a way of looking at life, that’s slightly atilt, slightly askew, perhaps, but it’s all me, you know?
 It’s what I am.
 I am a songwriter.

Doi’van was clearly asking himself the same thing.
 He looked over at Rodregas and shrugged.
 “We both have the power of the Infernal Realm in us.
 Is it easier for us to manage following the path of righteousness to let the power burn free or to take on the form of a greater sigil and bind the Infernal magic to a specific form?
 I think we must choose carefully.” Doi’van said and added, “For me the Bunei seems right.” Doi’van paused in that thoughtful way he had, considering all sides before taking action.
 “If it consumes my Infernal power I would gain its strengths.
 If I am lucky, what magic ability I have left will be mortal or Celestial in nature.
 The Bunei are creatures of magic, they are both great warriors and thinkers and magicians and are even known to sometimes help others.
 I cannot pass this chance up.
 I must see what will happen.” Rodregas nodded; they both knew they would not get this chance twice.

She kissed the top of his head.
 "Who are you going shopping with?"
 "No one, but I'm meeting Mother for lunch.
 Good-bye."
 She headed for the door.
 "Marie, you know that I don't approve of your going out alone."
 "Father," she sighed, turning to face him, "I'm 23 years old.
 That's certainly old enough to go into town alone."

I was finally able to push him away, and all he said was to make sure that you told me what my duties would be once we were married."
 Mrs. Tranton's eyes blazed.
 "Your father is going to kill him.
 Marie, no man should treat any woman that way, even his wife.
 Kissing--" "I know.
 And it's because of Rick that I know."
 "Rick?
 That's your friend's name?"
 "Yes.
 Mother, he's wonderful.

So which side do you think will have the privilege of our blades and magic?”
 “We will kill the elves,” Harruq said.
 The man in black nodded and then dismissed his bone general.
 “Go.
 Patch your wounds.”
 The half-orc bowed and then joined his brother.
 The two journeyed across the hills and then snuck inside Woodhaven.
 When they reached their home, Harruq removed his armor and began wrapping strips of old cloth around his wounds.
 Qurrah watched him for a moment before speaking.
 “You know what you must do, should it come to it,” he said.

It was time for music to mean something.
 Dylan, The Beatles, they led the way.
 They said, you know, show us the plan, you don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.
 And the kids sat up and listened.
 It was coming, this revolution of meaning, this concentration on the word.
 And, all along, behind it like a dark river, ran the beat, the melody, a sort of communication device that was both insidious and right out there in the open.
 See, rock wasn’t subversive to the people who wanted to know.
 It didn’t trick anybody.
 It’s the most godawful honest music on the planet.
 In the end, I think that’s what has kept it so powerful, its honesty, its lack of guile.

He meant to say more but stopped as another man neared the fountain.
 He was large, well-muscled, and scratching at a long beard that stretched down to his belt.
 In a massive voice, he shouted to the mulling throngs.
 “The royal guard is in need of able-bodied men to help rebuild the walls of the city,” he shouted.
 “The work will be hard, but we offer a threepence of copper a day.
 Come to the castle and ask for Alvrik.”
 He repeated the message three more times and then wandered back north.
 “A threepence,” Harruq said.
 “We could eat well for weeks.”
 “The king must be desperate for workers,” Qurrah said.

The touch left my skin warm and tingling.
 "That's what's so amazing about you.
 Almost everyone else at school was born here.
 They essentially look at every action as choosing between Alec and I. Britney, who could have legitimately stayed neutral, has been trying to get in my good graces almost since she arrived.
 You, on the other hand, couldn't care less who has the most money."
 It was an explanation.
 Not an iron-clad one, but good enough for now.
 I thanked Brandon for the ride, and was rewarded with one more wide, open smile before we split up and headed our separate ways.
 I kept telling myself not to get caught up in the idea of being with someone for the first time in my life, but still went through the first two classes more or less in a daze.
 Mrs. Sorenson was just as nasty as she'd been every day this week, but I didn't care when she managed to stump me on her second question.

The cool spring breeze was weak compared to the ice that locked his spine.
 He held a torch in one hand and a shortsword in the other.
 At first, he had thought himself foolish waking in a full panic from a nightmare he could not remember.
 Then he saw others about, lit torches in their hands, and he knew his fear was justified.
 A young, fat-nosed farmer saw him awake and approached.
 “Couldn’t sleep either, Jeremiah?” he asked.
 “Aye, had the worst nightmares.” Jeremiah glanced at the sword in the farmer’s hand.
 “You feel the same, don’t you?”
 The farmer nodded.
 “Feels like the dark god himself is coming for us.

"Comb your hair as you blow it--that'll make it dry faster.
 And this is how you turn it off.
 I'm going to go make breakfast.
 Come down when you're ready."
 The hot air felt good, and it was making her hair fluffy.
 Unfortunately, she didn't have any curling tongs, and her too-long hair, now perfectly straight, hung past her shoulders.
 With a sigh, she parted her hair in the middle and went downstairs.
 "Hair all dry?"
 Rick asked.
 "Hey--your hair looks great!

She pulled me into an open classroom and gave me a hug while I tried to explain about the two failed tests, my birthday, and how much I missed my Dad and Cindi.
 The last bit was especially garbled.
 I was pretty sure she wasn't getting any of it, but that didn't matter.
 All that mattered was I was finally able to tell someone.
 I never really got myself under control; my sobs just subsided enough for me to tell Rachel I wanted to go home.
 Isaac was standing right outside the classroom door, and unobtrusively helped Rachel get me to his car where she jumped into the back with me.
 Even through the haze of tears I could tell he wasn't happy about the seating arrangement, but once again Rachel showed the kind of iron will she'd demonstrated with James.
 Almost before I knew it we were rolling to a stop in my driveway.
 I fumbled, for the latch, but Rachel put a hand on my arm before I could get the door open.
 She handed me a white-wrapped package with a shy smile.

China’s economy continues to expand at more than eight per cent annually and India’s may soon achieve that rate of growth.
 Fuelled by very rapid expansion of automotive, financial services, IT, pharmaceuticals and telecommunications, India has emerged as one of the fastest growing economies in the world, the third largest destination for foreign investment, and a key player in IT and IT-enabled services.
 According to a recent study, by 2040 China and India will be the first and third largest economies in the world.
 Together with Russia and Brazil, they could account for a larger portion of world GDP than today’s six largest industrialized nations.
 Population, which was perceived as a liability not long ago, now appears to be an asset.
 In reality, population, like nuclear energy and so many other things, is neutral.
 Its value depends on what we human beings make of it.
 Changing Demographic Profile of the West: Demographic studies indicate that steep declines in the growth of population in Europe, Japan and USA will create acute labour shortages and unprecedented long-term demand for migration of foreign workers or transplantation of work to developing countries.
 UN and other studies estimate that Europe would have to accept 150 million new immigrants over the next 25 years in order to maintain the present levels of working population and Japan would need to admit 600,000 immigrants annually for the next 50 years in order to maintain the size of its working population at the 1995 level.
 The US labour force is projected to stop growing by 2013.

Were you dreaming?” I asked.
 He shook his head.
 “Just a bunch of nonsense I don't even remember.
 Why, did you get another vision?” “Yes,” I said.
 “It was with the same voice that was in my last dream.
 Only this time, I talked to the ghost girl.” “You did?
 What did she say?” “She hinted that she knew who made us this way and who attacked us that day,” I said.
 “She also said that Kojas would use our emotions against us and try to get us to come to him.” Something dark crossed Seth's face.
 “She also said that we were chosen because of our strong bond, but she said, not to test it,” I continued.
 “She also told me not to go into the shadows.” Seth stretched.

She was slowly backing up with her palms out.
 Fire danced from her fingertips and twisted towards the troll and frost beast.
 The beast breathed and ice sprayed from its mouth.
 Emily moved her hand over and the ice evaporated into mist.
 She was holding up fine but I didn’t know how much longer.
 I strung my bow and released an arrow.
 It pierced the frost beast’s pelt and it fell to the ground.
 Emily turned to me with huge, confused eyes.
 She mouthed the words, thank you.
 I nodded in response.

“You surprise me.
 It truly is a pleasure to meet you.”
 “And it is a pleasure to meet the elf that my brother is so smitten for.”
 Aurelia giggled at Harruq’s squirming.
 “He’s a loveable puppy dog, but I do not think he is smitten.
 Are you, Harruq?”
 “Um, course not,” the half-orc said.
 Aurelia and Qurrah shared a quick, knowing smile.
 The frail half-orc’s face lost much of its lifelessness, and a gentle caring filled his eyes.
 His seriousness quickly buried it, but Aurelia had seen enough.

“The orcs are almost here.”
 As if on cue, they heard a collective roar from the south.
 Harruq glanced at the stairs along the wall, but Qurrah saw this and shook his head.
 “We need to get closer to the fight,” Qurrah said, slurring his words.
 “I need to see him.”
 “Sure thing,” Harruq agreed.
 “Come on.
 I have an idea.”
 He grabbed Qurrah’s arm and hooked his elbow around it.
 Qurrah was too weak to complain, so together they ran down the streets.

Did I miss something?
 From Van Morrison to Lorelei.
 That’s a story, isn’t it, sweet?
 Um.
 It was at the Shell.
 Black Lung was playing, one of our first headlining gigs, I think.
 I came off stage after the encore, after we’d done a cooking version of “I Love my Aunt Jemima,” Skippy going wild like a man possessed, and maybe he was, man, maybe he was.
 This was Memphis, those things are real, man.
 No one looks askance at a little theurgy, you know, a little of that Memphis Mojo, that hoodoo that brought us everything from W. C. to Isaac to Booker to Big Star to Jism.
 I been playing rock, blues, jazz, ruckus, fife-and-drum, what have you, all my life.

She’d worn only her 1927 clothes, and her mind hadn’t wandered to 2011 at all.
 What more could she do?
 Well, one thing she wasn’t going to do was give up, she determined as she played with the hem of her dress.
 She’d strolled through her garden countless times without walking into 2011, so who knew how many times she’d have to walk in the garden to get back to 1927?
 She wasn’t going to give up.
 Rick, still concerned about Marie, left work at 4:30, making a quick stop to pick up a surprise for her.
 To his dismay, he found her huddled in a corner of the sofa, still wearing her 1927 clothes.
 “Hi, sweetheart,” he greeted her, going to sit beside her.
 “Are you feeling better?” “I’m all right.” “I brought you something.”  He handed her a plastic bag.
 She took it and reached inside.

She mumbled something and squeezed her sleeves.
 “I feel so heavy and gross.” Jason's eyes popped open.
 “Why are you complaining?
 You're freaking dryer than all of us and you got some awesome power, too.
 You can't complain.” “Language Jason,” she scolded.
 “I hate even being a tad wet so I feel like complaining.
 I just do, so deal.” Jason scowled and closed his eyes again.
 “I'm sleeping and if anyone wakes me up and it's not to kill something, I'll stab them with my dagger.” “Wow you're just a sparkly rainbow today,” I said.
 Emily shook her head.
 “He's just a fat crab.” “Maybe I am,” Jason said, “deal.” Emily sat near the entrance of the cave.

Doi’van was right, edged weapons were not of much use against a full set of plate armor.
 That is why knights or others who could afford the cost wore all that metal.
 Rodregas had to shrug; he had no answer other than an extended fight with the mace that often did not end until one or the other was too tired and battered to defend themselves.
 Doi’van nodded at Rodregas expression of confusion, “My clan is known as the greatest warriors there are against heavily armored opponents because we are masters of the halberd.
 With a halberd we can quickly dismount an armored warrior, knock him to the ground and then, with the leverage provided by the halberd…” He swung his staff and acted like he was holding down a foe with his left foot.
 He made a savage two-handed thrust downward, “...we can pierce his armor and win the battle quickly.” Rodregas nodded.
 He was not sure what this halberd weapon was; Rodregas assumed it was some sort of spear from the way Doi’van was holding the staff.
 Rodregas did not see how a spear could do what Doi’van was suggesting, but since Doi’van had been up for learning the Kata, he would be willing to learn how to fight with a long piece of wood.
 Doi’van then stepped forward and started swinging the staff with such mastery as to make it beautiful.
 The staff was but a blur as it whirled in one hand and then the other, behind his back, over his shoulder.

If she knew he was waiting for her, she’d have a harder time detaching herself from 2011.
 Marie awoke before dawn the next morning—as she had the morning she’d walked into 2011.
 She put on all her 1927 clothes, even the stockings that she’d stopped wearing once she’d gotten used to her comfortable 2011 clothes.
 She headed for the stairs but then stopped.
 Quietly she approached Rick’s door and opened it just a little.
 Rick was sprawled on his back, a sheet covering him from the waist down.
 Tears filled her eyes.
 She’d miss him so much.
 The sky was turning a dark gray when she walked into the garden.
 Grace, their cook, would be getting up soon.

Jim – Sure I am, this spring.
 Liz – You finally talked to your councilor?
 Jim – Yep.
 Liz – What did he say?
 Jim – Well, the first thing out of his mouth was “who the hell are you?”
 Liz – I told you that you should have talked to him sooner.
 Jim – He said the same thing,  at least after he figured out who I was.
 But then he told me that I was just about 20 credits from graduating, and at the end of this semester I would only need 8 more.
 Liz – Did he say anything else?
 Jim – He also asked why I had taken the Mayan art class, and a few others.

So, I’m still trying to absorb some things, follow some things that I thought of maybe back then and Jimi was there, he was undeniably there, like the monolith from 2001, you know?
 So, there were a lot of us cats playing the guitar, and…uh, I’ve lost the thread of what I was saying.
 CM:  	What about Dylan?
 BG: 	I have confused recollections of my first awareness of Bob Dylan.
 I have a vague memory of hearing “Song for Woody” on FM 100, back in Memphis, which at that time was an album-oriented station, not limited to a ludicrous playlist like it is today.
 It was a source back then, a touchstone.
 You could hear music unavailable elsewhere.
 The music of the planets.
 I listened to it alone in my parent’s living room, hearing sounds that transformed me as surely as did Lorelei, the finding of my own voice.
 “Talkin World War III Blues” was beyond my ken.

Studies cited by the World Bank estimate that the removal of trade barriers by the industrial nations would increase the exports of many developing countries by as much as 50 to 100 per cent, representing a gain in real income of $40 billion to $80 billion annually.
 For the least developed countries, these gains could be double the amount of official development assistance.
 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cited reasons for concluding that actual gains may be significantly higher than these estimates.
 New engines for global economy: Economic growth in the developing world is projected to remain strong throughout the decade, averaging 4 to 5 per cent per year in low- and middle-income countries.
 At a time of slackened demand and low levels of growth in most industrial nations, developing countries have become the principal engine driving expansion of the global economy and employment generation, whereas until recently the Third World was perceived primarily as a drag on the world economy or a threat to jobs in the West.
 The potential for much higher rates of growth in these countries, as recently achieved by China, can result in much larger flows of capital, technology and organizational know-how.
 Recognition of this opportunity should be central to the strategy of industrial nations for stimulating their own job growth.
 Advancing technology: The pace of technological development continues to accelerate.
 The application of biotechnology in agriculture offers significant opportunities to raise productivity and generate higher incomes for farmers.
 Medical biotechnology is opening up the prospect of longer, healthier lives of better quality for the elderly.

The mindless rage that had consumed him slowly faded.
 By the time his brother arrived, it was all but a memory.
 “The undead took them,” Qurrah said, his breath quick and shallow.
 “Velixar did not trust us.”
 “I trust little,” Velixar said, stepping through the line of his servants.
 “The truth is I do not take risks.
 If any survived you would have been identified and my plans ruined.”
 Both brothers bowed to their master.
 “What are the plans you speak of?” Harruq asked.
 “In time, my dear bone general, I will tell you both.

I nodded and headed over to a table near the girl, one where I could watch her without her seeing me.
 I wasn't going to fall all over myself to become her friend or anything, but I figured it was worth observing her for a little bit.
 If she really was cool then we might strike up a friendship at some point.
 If she wasn't, then the sooner I could confirm that fact the better off I'd be.
 I pulled out my book, study guide, and some paper, and got busy with my next self-assigned homework set.
 I was up to graphing now, which was about as straightforward as you could get.
 I made pretty good progress, pausing from time to time to stretch my neck and look around.
 The girl had flipped her card over to the red side, and had a tutor with her, a clumsy-looking boy who looked like he might be a senior.
 Based on the glasses, and the fact he had to have picked them out without any input from a girl younger than forty, I figured he was in debate, or maybe the chess club.
 He was probably incredibly nice, and boring as watching paint dry.

Lunch was an awkward affair.
 Britney was still upset.
 I, on the other hand, was extremely happy I'd made a good enough impression to get a job.
 I didn't like sitting there while Britney badmouthed Mrs. Campbell.
 I looked up during one of Britney's infrequent pauses for air, and caught Alec staring at me.
 Staring wasn't quite the right word though.
 Strangely enough, it didn't seem like he was necessarily mad, but he didn't seem happy either.
 I only caught his eyes for a few seconds before he looked away, but even his normally riveting blue eyes couldn't distract me from my inability to identify the look.
 I was used to people disliking me, ignoring me, or even occasionally liking me, but this was the first time I'd met someone who seemed to be still trying to decide what camp to join long past the time when most kids our age would have either made a decision or just decided I was weird and started ignoring me.
 Britney seemed to be getting suspicious that I wasn't really listening, so I had to make a lot of eye contact over the next few minutes.

"Wow, I wonder what's going on over there."
 We were both out of the car now, and it seemed the most natural thing in the world to grab Brandon's arm and tug him over to the crowd.
 It wasn't until I felt the iron-hard muscles under my now-tingling hand that I realized what I'd done.
 I felt a surge of heat wash over my face and neck.
 Brandon for once didn't have an easy comeback to defuse the awkwardness.
 If anything he looked slightly uncomfortable himself.
 "I'm sure it's nothing important..." He trailed off as my traitorous hand found his arm of its own accord and started pulling again.
 I wasn't sure why I was so anxious; usually I avoided crowds like the plague.
 Maybe I was just trying to prolong our time together.
 I let go as soon as we reached the fringe of the crowd, and prayed it was only my imagination that made me think Brandon was just the slightest bit relieved.

The magic energy throbbed and Rodregas could feel the ritual screaming for the final release of the magic; there was no way to save anyone else.
 Rodregas would probably die in the next few seconds in the magical backlash of the failed spell, but he thought that he had understood the meaning of the final trigger words used in the rehearsal.
 Rodregas’ years of rejecting his early upbringing made him embarrassed to say the words, but he reached down into that deep, nearly empty place where his little bit of power still sparked.
 Rodregas reached deep inside and pulled that spark of power up until he felt the tingle and inner sensation that he always inelegantly called ‘my itch.’ Rodregas filled his words with the power and the intent behind them.
 “My mind,” he said.
 “My soul to be made one through the flame,” he whispered, and then the circle of blood and living organs started to burn and he burned.
 He burned so deeply that no scream crossed his lips.
 He felt every fiber of his being simply burn.
 Rodregas tried to scream, but no sound could pass his lips.

He took advantage of the silence, giving orders to Ruby.
 “Take her to the house.” She had me at once, towing me beside her as she retrieved our cloaks.
 Chevelle was still instructing, “Steed, watch the front, stay inside.
 Grey, take the rear, out of sight.
 Anything, no matter how trivial, signal the wolves.” Wolves.
 They had been wolves, not dogs.
 I immediately had more respect for the tall, pale-haired elves.
 Men who tamed wild wolves.
 We were back at the house in what seemed like a heartbeat.
 Steed watched the village from the front room.

I was in Guild Dealer Taigas’ Menagerie to be sold within a week of my arrival.” He finished, his smile fading at the memory.
 “When was that?” Rodregas asked.
 Doi’van looked at him for a second and said, “Two years ago.” “But that makes no sense,” Rodregas said, his voice angry though he did not know why.
 “The Guild is supposed to be trying to make their Immortalists members Celestial.
 Why would they hold you for two years?” Doi’van nodded but then shook his head.
 “Trust me, I would like to know that answer more then you.” Doi’van’s smile was now long gone and with a shrug of his huge misshaped shoulders, he changed the subject.
 “So, Imeralda, the stone here still seems strong and like new, though clearly, it has been long after the construction of this place.” She was looking at Doi’van strangely and it seemed to take her a moment to shift gears and answer his question.
 “Yes…of course construction like this…stone enchanted to absorb the power…it makes the stone stronger with that power.
 Stones formed like this will last as long as the ley line does not move, which happens only rarely and over centuries.
 What is strange is this is not a farm designed by Nymphs.

Jim – That too.
 Liz – So what did you suggest?
 Jim – I told him that calling people at 3 am wasn’t evil.
 Calling people at 3 am long distance and collect is evil.
 I figured that way he would at least stop calling me.
 Liz – Oh, that’s all.
 Wait a minute… How did he get the queen of England’s home phone number?
 And how did he get them to accept a long distance collect call from someone they didn’t even know?
 And how did he do it without being caught and sent over to the Brits for the butt-whupping that he deserved?
 Jim – I think he found the number on the internet.

Dieredon held on tight, trusting his life to Sonowin.
 He scanned the battlefield while they whirled up and down, over one hand and then dancing away from another.
 Just as Sonowin pulled higher and higher into the air, outracing more than seven growing hands reaching up for them, the elf spotted two lone figures amid the sea of dead.
 “Sonowin,” he shouted to his steed.
 “There, you must get to them!”
 The horse snorted, banked around, and dove straight for the approaching hands.
 A quick spiral avoided the first wave.
 Dieredon clutched his bow and held on for dear life, his eyes locking on the man in black who stood perfectly still, his arms at downward angles from his body.
 The rest of the elves were in full retreat.
 He was the only one left.

 “When should we attack?” Harruq asked.
 His twin swords itched in his hands.
 Qurrah, sitting next to him in a little back alley next to Ahrqur’s old home, laughed.
 “So eager to kill, brother?
 I was beginning to think you had grown soft.”
 The bigger half-orc smashed his swords together, focusing on the pain the shower of sparks caused his hands.
 “I’m still who I’ve always been,” he said.
 “You’ll see.”
 Qurrah’s smile faded at the ferocity in his brother’s words.

The fact I actually was terrified she was going to snap and start trying to kill people was irrelevant.
 If I could convince her I wasn't scared, I was less likely to get hurt.
 I kept walking, not necessarily steering closer to the three-quarter wall the boy was leaning against, but also being very careful not to go out of my way to stay further away from them either.
 As I got close to the pair, a little more of the boy became visible, reaffirming my impression that he wasn't happy to be talking to her.
 His shoulders looked unnaturally tight and he was shaking his head slowly from side to side.
 Locked as I was into my course, I couldn't help but hear them both as I got closer.
 "I can't do this, Jasmin.
 I've been meaning to tell you for a while, but I was afraid of how you'd react."
 I half stumbled at the raw pain in his voice.
 While I was still trying to recover my balance, Jasmin looked up at me, and the force of her glare almost made me fall over my feet again.

The older boys and girls would still be out to play, but the younger ones…
 Harruq stopped.
 Aurelia positioned herself to the side, struggling to keep her breathing calm lest she alert him to her presence.
 They were beside an old house made of slanted boards shoddily nailed together.
 There was no glass for the window, nor a covering.
 She wondered what the occupants did during the winter months, preferring her mind dwell on that than the terrible look marring Harruq’s face.
 His skin had turned ashen.
 His right hand stroked the hilt of his sword like an itch he couldn’t ignore.
 He put a hand on the wood.
 Aurelia could only imagine what he saw: a small child slumbering in bed, positioned by the window to keep him cool.

Biology?
 Character?
 It’s inexplicable, really.
 All of my roommates had dropped out of high school but somehow I continued; although my grades sucked, they were passing grades.
 In my senior year I only took classes until noon because that is all I needed to graduate.
 I got another job at a local restaurant for the lunch shift as well as any days I was off from the grocery store.
 I realized at an early age that nobody was going to give me anything and if I wanted something I would need to earn it.
 If I didn’t succeed, I wouldn’t survive!
 Somewhere around this time, I decided to try and find my biological father, Richard, a natural thing for a young man my age to want to do, right?
 So I tracked him down and called him.

feminine."
 She smiled, pleased with his response.
 "Should I let it grow longer?"
 "Definitely."
 He smiled.
 "Have a seat--breakfast's ready."
 She sat down and poured milk on her cereal.
 "Mmm--this is delicious."
 "Good.
 Do you want milk or juice or both?"

"I've held you a number of times.
 Was that wrong?"
 She dropped her gaze.
 "Well, no.
 Not proper, really, but not immoral."
 He reached out to squeeze her hand.
 "Listen to yourself, Marie.
 You're describing a crush, not love.
 He's tall, he's handsome, he makes you feel romantic--you don't love him!
 He's like a movie star."

You try squeezing out information from one of these pests.” “I did.” “Whatever guys, we’re getting nowhere.
 Hey Emily you want to sleep over tonight?” I asked.
 Emily frowned, “It’s my turn, Jazell, and you’re coming over my house.” “Honestly, Em, just come over…” “No,” she said and crossed her arms stubbornly.
 I sighed and ran a hand through my hair, knowing it was useless to argue with her when her mind was made up.
 “Fine, I’ll call my parents.
 But next time you’re coming to my house.” She nodded, her curls bobbing.
 “Fair enough.” “Okay then, see you two later.” Jason turned around with Seth on his heels.
 “Wait a minute you two.
 It’s only,” I popped open my phone, “3pm.
 We still have the rest of the day.” I shoved the phone back in my pocket.

The pervasive influence of science in society requires that we bridge the gap that presently divides the sciences and humanities and evolve an educational system in which science is no longer regarded as a specialized field of study.
 Fourth, radical changes are needed in the content of school curricula at all levels to make education relevant to the real needs of the students and the development of the country.
 The society whose system of education is integrated with the social aspirations of the country will develop most rapidly.
 The system of education prevalent in most developing countries is oriented toward the outer form – acquiring a degree or qualifying certificate – rather than the inner content of knowledge.
 Educated unemployment is a direct result of a system that fosters obedience and rote learning rather than individual initiative and creative thinking.
 A new system of development education needs to be introduced at all levels to equip the student with an understanding of his/her society, its achievements and potentials, and the opportunities open to each individual to participate in its future growth.
 The index of its success will be the extent to which students of this curriculum seek self-employment rather than salaried jobs.
 Fifth, minimum and average educational levels should be raised in all countries.
 Two centuries ago education was a luxury of the rich and it was simply inconceivable that every member of the population in any country could receive even a minimum level of education.
 Few of the industrial nations fully meet their own present minimum standards for every citizen.

But I didn’t make it far.
 Exhaustion caught up with me a few miles later and I found an old oak tree, sliding down its massive trunk to rest my aching legs.
 I’d never run so far in my life and my head throbbed.
 I was seething with anger and frustration and the feeling of being ensnared.
 I didn’t sleep.
 I sat, leaned against the tree, like a petulant child.
 I held a hand up and flipped a flame, tossing it up and down, rolling it above my palm.
 I was hungry, but I didn’t eat.
 Too stubborn and angry to go find food, too resentful I didn’t have the magic to bring it to me.
 Yes, like a child.

Twice that fall, the minute school let out on Friday, we sped north on Highway 101.
 From Morro Bay to Santa Cruz, we followed the coast and made camp for the night on a cliff between Hearst Castle and Big Sur.
 Saturday, midmorning, we landed in North Beach, San Francisco.
 As we passed strip joints whose signage featured females twice as buxom as Lil' Abner's Daisy Mae, doormen beckoned and dared us to enter, though we were four years underage.
 We stood gawking at the posters on jazz clubs.
 Miles Davis, Gerry Mulligan, Stan Getz, Horace Silver, Coltrane, George Shearing.
 Sylvia had taught Eric to revere and me to appreciate those fellows.
 We shot pool at Mike’s, where Kerouac had drunk plenty, according to Big Sur.
 We slouched in the catacombs of City Lights bookstore reading apocalyptic poems and hoping for a glimpse of the owner, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the poet who loaned Kerouac his Big Sur cabin.
 We roamed alleys and climbed hills no doubt mistaking mathematicians, who commuted daily to San Jose, for poets or novelists.

The darkness swirled inward as if Velixar were the center of a giant drain.
 The blackness filled him, surrounded him, and consumed him.
 When all returned, and Dieredon was about to land, a wave of pure sound and energy rippled outward.
 Velixar was waking, and he was angry.
 The wave sent Qurrah crashing against a giant undead man still wearing rusted platemail.
 The collision blasted the air from his lungs.
 When he hit the ground, stars filled his vision.
 Dieredon fought but could not resist that same wave of power.
 The point of his blade halted a foot from the top of the black hood before he flew back.
 In the distance, Qurrah watched his master glaring at the damned elf who had fallen like a mad man.

 Eugene – Well I’m thinking of changing it to make it scarier…
 Jim – Oh God, here we go
 Eugene – …and since you have so many good ideas I could really use your help.
 Jim – What do you want?
 Something like ‘Eugene the Destroyer’?
 Eugene – No no no!
 I want a name that rings through the ages, one that people will remember one thousand years from now, one that rolls off their tongue, even as it makes them quiver in fear.
 Jim – Well ‘Eugene the Destroyer’ wont really do that.

Meat consumption in China has tripled since 1978 and is expected to more than double again over the next two decades.
 Sugar consumption in developing countries is currently less than half the average of industrial nations.
 In India, sugar consumption is projected to rise from 13 kg to more than 25 kg, generating a demand for a 100 per cent increase in sugar cane production, the establishment of 300 to 400 new sugar mills in the country and the creation of 3 to 4 million new jobs in this industry alone.
 Worldwide, raising the average level of sugar consumption in developing countries could generate tens of millions of additional jobs in agriculture, industry and services.
 Viewing the future demand for food from this perspective reveals a tremendous opportunity.
 Vast sections of humanity now aspire to the higher quantity, wider variety and greater nutritional content of food once consumed only by the wealthy.
 An effort to raise nutritional standards in the developing countries nearer to the levels prevalent among industrial countries will not only eradicate hunger, but also dramatically spur economic growth, employment, and purchasing power among the rural poor, stimulating growth of production and jobs in industry and services, as well as increasing exports and imports.
 Raising the entire world population to the level of the prosperous nations would require a 72 per cent increase in total world food production, measured in terms of calories.
 In order to meet the people’s nutritional requirements for fruit and vegetables, India’s production of these crops needs to double within the next decade.
 Achieving that high level will generate more than six million new jobs in the country.

Her slender frame twisted.
 A sword cut a thin line across the green fabric of her dress but did not touch skin.
 She thought Harruq might stop and claim the cut counted.
 He didn’t.
 Instead he crosscut, his left arm swiping right while the other swept left.
 She turned to one side, using her staff to press one sword into the dirt and knock the second swipe just above her.
 The staff continued twirling, positioning Harruq’s hands further out of place.
 She used the awkwardness to gain further separation between them.
 Her hands ached from the force of every block and parry.
 Her breath was fast and shallow.

“Yup, never better.
 I'm just having a minute to myself.” “Okay...” I trailed off.
 Seth walked over to join us.
 “We should get moving and find somewhere else to stay.
 If we stay and argue in the forest, something worse is bound to find us.” “Right, lead the way,” I said and pushed off the tree.
 Seth nodded and I walked beside him as he led us, once again, through the woods.
 Emily and Jason were talking quietly about something which gave us both the opportunity to talk.
 “You think Kojas sent them?” I mumbled to him and pushed a branch away.
 He looked at me from the corner of his eye.
 “Obviously, why else would they say that the 'King' would underestimate them?” “You make a good point,” I said.

Only he revised, changed his life, and made Joe Ben a real hero.
 Remembering that Kesey and Cassady were friends, I look up some dates.
 Sure enough, they met while Kesey was writing that novel, two years before it came out.
 And no doubt he had read Kerouac's novels featuring Cassady, a.k.a.
 Dean Moriarty et al.
 In Sometimes a Great Notion, Joe Ben used to be, as a teen, so handsome and so enthralled by girls, he never could have stayed true to any one of them.
 But a motorcycle crash disfigured his perfect face.
 Still, his girlfriend sticks by him.
 She becomes his wife and the mother of his kids.
 And Joe Ben comes to believe that God had allowed that tragedy to save him from the fate of his father, who died a lonely, sex-obsessed drunk.

The sound of a hand coming down hard on a desk pulled me from my refuge.
 "I told you all to keep it to a dull roar.
 I want everyone back to your seats."
 A couple people looked like they wanted to give the sub a hard time, but these were all the kids who were hoping to make it into the top ten percent of their graduating class.
 None of them really had a disobedient bone in their body.
 They grudgingly returned to their seats and left Alec by himself.
 I picked my pencil back up and started drawing again, only to be disturbed by someone clearing their throat.
 Alec was looking down at me with something almost like a smile playing at the corner of his lips.
 For a second I couldn't blame the other girls for swarming him over.
 He was so attractive it was hard to remember he was such a jerk.

“Live with it Seth.” Emily said every word apart and wacked him again.
 Seth made a small, “Ow.” Every time she hit him.
 He grimaced and said, “Stop hitting me already!” “Alright,” She made a motion to put the stick down and hit him again in the head.
 He glared at her and she threw it on the floor, “Now I’m done.” “So Jason,” I faced him and he looked up at me, “since Seth won’t tell me I’ll ask you.
 How did you guys find us?” “We followed a dwarf that was running here.
 If we didn’t get lost, we would have been here faster,” Jason’s face turned the color of his red Igneerian hair.
 “It’s okay, at least you answered me,” I shot Seth a look.
 “Well if it’s okay with you boys, we would like to get to bed.
 It’s almost 1:30 in the morning, and I would like to get home before my dad wakes himself up,” Emily said, and walked towards her house.
 I waved quickly and followed.

During our games, pulling for Cody, I came to understand why a father I knew dropped dead in the stands, when his heart failed while his son was pitching.
 As teenagers, my kids carried on the family tradition of abject rebellion, to the degree that I wrote a Reader story about the Tough Love group I was attending weekly.
 The year my kids began to climb out of the mud, I met Pam.
 * Back when I had only one child, someone told me that two was as easy or easier than one.
 Whoever said that ought to be gagged.
 At least in my family, while one kid slept, the other wouldn’t.
 When one behaved, the other raised hell.
 Everything one gets, the other wants.
 And so on.
 (Read Mark Twain’s Roughing It to learn how this plays out in large Mormon families.)

You-you don’t know how to get home, do you?”  When she didn’t respond, he said, “Just come look at my newspaper.
 You don’t have to come inside.
 Just sit on my veranda, and when the fog lifts, we’ll-we’ll see if we can find your house.” Afraid of becoming even more lost, she hesitantly followed him to some chairs and perched on the edge of one.
 The man ran inside, and before she could decide whether it was better to wait or leave, he’d returned with a newspaper.
 Marie read one headline: "Obama Popularity Index Declining."
 Neither the words nor the picture meant anything to her.
 Then she checked the date: May 22, 2011.
 She raised her eyes to the man's.
 "This is a joke."
 "No.

Jim – And let me guess, a good kisser.
 Eugene – We never actually got to the kissing point of the relationship.
 Johnny – I didn’t want to know that!
 Jim – And that’s why it’s so damned funny.
 Besides, you’ll need some knowledge about such things if you ever manage to talk some girl into spending time with you.
 Johnny – Well, so what if I haven’t been out with a woman yet…
 Jim – You scare them Johnny.
 In fact you make most people uncomfortable.
 It’s all the anger.
 If you keep going on the way that you have, you’ll end up dieing alone.

"My sincere apologies that we weren't better hosts.
 Please let me know if there is anything you need to make your stay here more comfortable."
 I stammered out a thanks as Donovan released my hand.
 The rest of Alec's friends were already disappearing, Isaac and Jessica around back towards the garden, while James and Dominic were already inside his car, and backing down the lane.
 Alec took my hand as Donovan opened the front door for us.
 He walked with a definite limp, one that was all the more painful when contrasted against his otherwise graceful movements.
 I looked questioningly at Alec, but he shook his head, so I stayed quiet as he led me into the house.
 Rachel was waiting for us in a luxuriously-furnished sitting room.
 "Mother's been asking for you, Alec.
 I told her you'd be back soon, but she's worried."

I picked him up hitchhiking.
 He settled into the seat, set his Bible on his lap, stared at me for a minute and asked, “Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?” “Yep,” I said, and readied myself to field the standard subsequent questions.
 Tony said, “Oh.
 Good.” A week later, he was leading a Bible study at our house.
 Cliff’s not much of a talker.
 I believe nobody heard his stories from Vietnam until years afterward.
 I don’t pry, so I can’t be sure what goes on inside him, but I have no reason to think he believes in God, or that he doesn’t.
 But whether he believes or not, Cliff has gotten well blessed since our evening with Billy Graham.
 He has four wonderful kids, and Toni, who is one of those rarest of people who appear to grow brighter, stronger, and more beautiful every year.
 Cliff and Billy's dad, Cliff Senior, invited me to dinner not many years ago.

"What are you doing?
 You didn't actually hit your head.
 I caught you before you hit the ground."
 I started to shake my head and then thought better of it.
 "Please, every other time I've dropped that quickly I've totally banged myself up.
 You were on the other side of my desk, there's no way you got all the way around it and managed to catch me before I hit the ground."
 The mild amusement on Alec's face froze into something else.
 "Believe what you will.
 There's no reason to worry about a concussion."
 "Then why did you tell the sub I'd hit my head?"

I don’t like just staying here, when more monsters might come.
 We can’t do two things at once.” Emily nagged anyway.
 I could just picture her bouncing up and down on her heels, full of tension.
 I felt rush of hot air near my left side.
 Seth was probably sighing, “We can’t move her Emily.
 If we could, we would.” I opened my eyes to see Seth face hovering above me.
 Emily was pacing in the background and Jason was standing off to the side, looking very uninterested in the current situation.
 Seth smiled at me and I felt myself blush.
 It was kind of embarrassing to get knocked out when no one else did.
 “Welcome back, zombie hunter girl,” Seth teased.

Jim – Most of those names aren’t well known, and the people who do know them would die of laughter rather than of fear.
 Liz – Use a modern monster name then, like King Kong or Dracula or something.
 Eugene – Hey great!

 It’s perfect.
 GODZILLA!
 Jim – Godzilla is just a guy in a dinosaur costume.
 You’d do about as well taking the name Barney.
 Maybe then you’d get people to hug you.

“What are you?” Qurrah asked.
 Velixar laughed.
 “How much do you know of the gods of this world, Qurrah Tun?”
 Qurrah shrugged.
 “I know their names and little else.
 Karak is death, Ashhur is life, and Celestia everything else, if the ramblings of priests and elves is to be believed.”
 Velixar nodded, the fire in his eyes growing.
 “This world is young, Qurrah, and Karak and Ashhur are young gods.
 Only five-hundred years ago they came and gave life to man.” Those eyes twinkled.
 “I was one of the first they made.”

You’ll be waiting out front.
 Right?” “Right.” We stopped at the door to the lobby, looked back and saw Johnny’s convertible turn the corner.
 Then we hoisted our suitcases and double-timed up the road.
 We stayed at the cheapest motel, about a half-mile north.
 In the morning we hitchhiked to Fort Lauderdale.
 This was during college spring break, a sad time to be in that town if you were eighteen, on a peanut butter budget, and didn’t belong to a fraternity.
 The girls were taken.
 The parties were private, the bars off limits to minors.
 We spent our evenings with the fellow who had picked us and invited us to flop with him and his roommates.
 The three of them were carpenters, down from New York and New Jersey for the winter.

“Flee west,” Jeremiah ordered Corren.
 “And take every one you find with you.”
 The old man put a hand on the young farmer’s shoulder.
 “Fear not,” he said, a weak smile on his face.
 “Ashhur’s golden eternity awaits us.”
 Jeremiah raised his sword so that the flame of his torch flickered across it.
 “Not this night, not if I can help it,” he said before running toward the battle cry.
 The town held only ninety members, half of them younger than eighteen.
 When the second brutal cry rolled over the houses, most were running west, dragging children and carrying young ones in their arms.
 The men, young and old, took up torches, shortswords, even rakes and sickles, and prepared to defend their homes.

The idiot ran off.
 Seth pushed himself up at a surprising speed and raced off into the woods.
 I did the crazy thing that people like me would do and followed him.
 I looked over my shoulder to see if Emily and Jason were coming but both of them stared at me, baffled.
 Their faces disappeared as I was swallowed by the trees.
 I skidded to a halt and scanned the trees.
 I didn’t see any trace of where Seth could have ran.
 That shows how much I know about asking questions.
 I don’t get the answers and boom; I lose it and become a demanding person.
 I walked more slowly, watching the trees.

His hands were around his enemy’s throat and his strength at its greatest.
 The crunching flesh underneath his fingers was all that mattered.
 The elf behind him retrieved his sword and attacked, his right arm hanging useless, his left stabbing desperately.
 Harruq flung the dying body around by the neck.
 The sword buried up to the hilt in the makeshift shield.
 Harruq dropped the dead elf and lashed out.
 His backhand broke the elf’s jaw.
 Reeling, the elf staggered back, only able to raise his meager arm above his head.
 Harruq smashed an elbow into his chest, followed by knuckled fists atop his skull.
 “Stay down,” Harruq said.

“Too late,” said a voice from the stairs.
 Both turned to see Ahrqur standing at the top step, his arms crossed.
 He was dressed in a long green robe.
 Silver swirls marked the sleeves and front.
 Brown hair fell far past his shoulders.
 “Pleased to meet you,” Harruq said with a bow.
 “Indeed,” Qurrah said, his hand itching to retrieve his whip curled underneath his raggedy robe.
 “If you are thieves, you are certainly incompetent ones,” Ahrqur said, his voice full of contempt.
 He descended halfway down the stairs, his eyes never leaving the two.
 “Of course, what could one expect from Celestia’s cursed?”

Each side was twisted metal that ended in the ground.
 In the center, two pieces spun together and ended holding a pulsing, black crystal.
 You should have been able to look right through the archway but there seemed to be a sheet of transparent black glass in the way.
 “This is the door to Igneeria,” the dwarf pronounced proudly.
 I fought the urge to say, “No duh!” Jason looked up, mesmerized.
 “Epic.” “Epic?” Seth scoffed.
 “That’s all you can say?
 This,” he motioned to the dark archway, “can't be described by one word.” I smiled to myself.
 The old Seth seemed to be coming back, which was great.
 I was getting really tired of quiet, watching Seth.

The half-orc’s frustration grew.
 “That’s it,” he muttered to himself.
 “Just one more and I’m going home.
 To the abyss with all this.” An elf approached.
 He had long brown hair, walnut eyes, and an elaborate bow slung on his back.
 The hardened look on his face gave Harruq little hope.
 “Do you know of a woman named Aurelia?” he asked anyway.
 “Aurelia?” the elf asked.
 “Why in all of Dezrel would you be looking for her?”
 “She, um, I kind of…” The half-orc faltered.

They said he was sensationalizing the attack to get his fifteen minutes of fame.
 Daddy tried to get access to the bodies, to provide a second opinion even though that isn't his real area of expertise, but they blocked him cold.
 He thinks they were worried about scaring away the tourists.
 They had to make the accident go away, to save the local economy."
 My hands had gone cold despite the oppressive heat, just now hitting its full stride for the day.
 You didn't hang around the fringe without running into plenty of people who were conspiracy theorists.
 Discussing UFOs, Illuminati, and X-Files had been like air and water for some of the people I'd known back in Minneapolis.
 I'd never given their wild theories a second thought before, but what Britney was describing sounded like a pretty convincing attempt at a cover-up.
 I looked up as I realized Britney had fallen silent, only to realize with a start that a pair of tears were trickling down her face.
 "Mark and Lessi were the only ones to really open up when I moved in.

Only Brandon's group hadn't been gossiping.
 They'd been discussing, brainstorming even.
 I didn't know what it meant.
 I didn't even know if it was a good thing.
 It made Brandon more intriguing, but he hardly needed any more help there.
 With a sigh of frustration, I walked into Physics, smiled at Mrs. Alexander, and took my normal seat.
 I could pretty much set my watch by Alec's arrival.
 Apparently it wasn't cool to be caught inside a classroom more than fifteen seconds before the bell rang.
 It was a sign of just how far removed from reality I was that he was able to sit down in the other corner before I even realized he'd stepped through the door.
 I realized I must have been woolgathering for longer than I'd thought, and reached for my notebook.

Encouraging voluntary part-timism by removing the artificial barriers to job sharing created by employment laws, social security tax laws, administrative procedures and trade unions would raise the morale and productivity of those who prefer to work less, while creating openings for many who are now without jobs.
 In the Netherlands, voluntary part-timism has been identified as the biggest single potential for creating new jobs, capable of reducing the country's unemployment by up to 50 per cent.
 Proportionately reducing working hours and salaries can spread the existing work more evenly over more people.
 Evidence suggests that reduced working time can raise productivity significantly.
 Extending vacation time and medical leave in the United States nearer to levels which the Europeans enjoy would create many more job openings.
 Work or job sharing is not an ultimate answer in itself, but it can have a beneficial short-term impact, allowing time for longer-term measures to take effect.
 As a minimum, governments should remove the artificial barriers to job-sharing created by employment laws, administrative procedures and trade unions.
 Social security tax systems should also be modified to remove the in-built bias that increases the taxes of those who hold multiple, part-time jobs, rather than one full-time job.
 Such constraints limited part-time jobs to around 10 per cent of the total in Belgium, France, Italy and Spain compared to around 25 per cent in Britain and Denmark.
 4.Modify tax policies:The present income and payroll tax system raises the real cost of labour relative to other resources, such as capital and energy, and thereby discourages job creation.

The confusion burned hotter in his gut.
 “You’re right,” Qurrah said, standing to his full height.
 “No more have to die.
 But what we do doesn’t matter, for more always will.”
 He opened his hands.
 Fueled by dark magic, the bones shot forth, piercing the elf’s throat and eyes.
 Against the window his dying body fell, his arms still held wide as if offering an embrace that would never be returned.
 Qurrah stared at the corpse, and as the blood pooled on the floor he felt himself standing once more on solid ground.
 The elves were his enemy.
 His brother was his only friend.

 “A great quest from the king, you could say.

 You know what I think?
 I think elves can look like anything.
 They’re devious little pricks like that, and you two seem rather ugly and devious, don’t you all agree?”
 The other guards laughed and shouted in agreement.
 They had spread out, flanking the half-orcs on all sides.
 The leader stepped forward and gestured with his weapon.

"She's really nice.
 So is Jeremy.
 I'd like to have them over again next week."
 He waited for her to add, "If I'm still here."
 When she didn't, he released a slow sigh of relief.
 "OK.  You probably won't be so nervous about it next time."
 She smiled, joining him on the sofa.
 "I might even use garlic again.
 But I have to admit that I sneaked upstairs to brush my teeth after we ate."
 He tilted her face up so that their lips were almost touching.

Neither moved.
 Neither spoke.
 Qurrah felt his nerves fray, and in his gut a sudden confusion swelled.
 He felt as if he hung over the side of a cliff, and the bones he held were the rope.
 The elf let go of his bow and held his hands out to either side.
 “No more have to die,” the elf said.
 The flesh around his eyes sagged wearily, and he leaned against the window to aid in standing.
 It was as if grief had rendered him lifeless.
 Let go, Qurrah thought.
 He could let go.

How about that one over there, with that guy lighting a match under that elephant’s foot?
 Liz – It’s called ‘Eugene’s Last Prank,’ and if you can’t tell what its about, then I want to know what you’ve done with the real Jim Trelain.
 Jim – You got his hair perfect, but I don’t think he’d stoop to something that low-tech and effective, knowing Gene, he’d probably build a catapult and try to coax the elephant onto it, and then see how far an elephant can fly when it’s launched through the air by a weapon of war.
 Liz – Also knowing Gene, he’d build the catapult way too small, or he would launch himself on accident, but with his luck he wouldn’t die.
 The poor old lady that he’d land on would break his fall.
 But what Gene would try to do in real life doesn’t really matter, as that drawing isn’t literal.
 On with the critique.
 Jim – I also liked the one with all the bright swirls of color on top of that layer of white.
 It’s just seems so cheerful and happy, it really cheers me up.
 You must have been in a good mood when you painted it.

I started to feel like that, that I was a chimp, a dancing fool.
 This was like before The Moratorium, right?
 Before we really all felt the power.
 The War was just this endless one-note playing over and over and driving us insane—me insane, sorry, driving me insane.
 And, like, I know that a song is just a song—yet, I have to believe there is something there, an element, a catalytically charged element.
 I didn’t want religion—who listens to priests, clergymen, even those who take to the streets?
 Ali has more power.
 Ali reaches more people.
 But a song, you know, a good song, well, it does tunnel deep into the consciousness.
 Did I think I could do anything with the right words, well-placed, well-played?

"There, I'm not touching you, and I still want to go to the dance with you.
 Want it more than anything else."
 That wasn't completely true.
 I wanted him to kiss me even more than I wanted to go to the Ashure Day Dance.
 Having him touch me in other ways was pretty high on the list too, but maybe that was just psychosomatic.
 He didn't need to know that.
 I really did want to spend time with him.
 Even if he wasn't going to touch me, being with him was better than being anywhere else.
 "This is a mistake.
 The worst kind of mistake because we both know it's wrong and we don't care."

 Though she didn’t explain, I suppose her expulsion resulted from her theory about evil being inside us all or from the fear she would infect the congregation with notions that could lead to an epidemic of broken marriages.

 Before they leave, Curly reaches down and rubs my shoulder.

 “Where do we go?” he asked, his voice revealing his defeat.
 “We’ll figure it out in the morning.

 “That’s right.

Slowly, and with a few wide curves through the carnage, he found a way out.
 He huddled the black robes tighter about his thin body, relishing the soft feel and perfect fit.
 Smoke clogged his lungs, but the stinking waves of it were lessening the farther he walked.
 “Where are you, brother?” Qurrah asked once he could breathe freely.
 In the dark before the dawn, it seemed he would receive no answer.
 At last, he could travel no more.
 He had no food, no destination, and no company.
 His limbs were weak and his head throbbed.
 To his knees he slumped, and he let time pass and his strength return, while his mind rummaged for ideas of how to proceed.

As admirable as Isaac's calm was, I was actually wishing he was a little more worked up.
 I'd seen plenty of fights where the guy who got the first hit in won.
 Vincent was going to throw the first punch, and then Isaac was going to go down like a house of cards.
 Something Vincent said must've been particularly vile.
 Isaac's expression shifted for just a second.
 They were circling now, both amazingly graceful considering that they were still on the stairs.
 Everyone stepped back a little further.
 I hobbled up a stair or two in an effort to avoid getting in the way.
 I'd heard of tension so thick you could cut it with a knife, but this was the first time I'd ever experienced it.
 It felt like there was electricity surging back and forth between Vincent and Isaac, making my skin feel too small.

He ducked, of course, and it landed on the ground.
 “What if whatever you’re not telling us happens and we never knew?
 How would that help anyone?” He looked down and mumbled something that sounded like, “You couldn’t help.” When he looked back up he said, “Fine you win, I’ll tell you.” He didn’t sound happy about it.
 “I’m waiting.” “You know, when Emily asked for any warnings that we were given?” “Yeah.” I had a bad feeling where this was going.
 “I lied.” I blinked in amazement.
 “You lied to Emily?
 She’s going kill you.” He smiled faintly.
 “She doesn’t need to know.” “So a dwarf told you something?
 Why didn’t you tell us?” I asked.

“Antonil…‌something more is at work here.
 Be wary.
 I will not take sides in this conflict, and neither shall the Quellan elves, but if I find who caused this war, I will kill him.
 It is the least I can do.”
 A great beat of white wings and then the elf was in the air.
 Antonil watched him fly far south, watched until he was a tiny white dot among a blanket of stars.
 Before he stopped watching, however, he saw more than fifty similar white dots line the horizon.
 The guard captain smiled, somehow heartened by the sight.
 “Let us hope for miracles,” he whispered to the night.
 “And let us hope that at tomorrow’s end all my troops are still alive.”

 That and he hated dad from the beginning because dad isn’t a religious person, and that dad had the audacity to question anything grandpa said.

 It’s amazing that mom and dad actually got married.
 He spent years trying to talk mom into out of dating dad, and finally he all but disowned her when they got married.

 Anyway, Memphis, yeah, it’s still part of that—the signpost on the road.
 Memphis still burbles up through even my most contented piece of songwriting, still smolders underneath it all.

 Her heart began to race.

For a second I couldn't think about anything other than the agony.
 When I managed to get my eyes to focus again, Vincent was only a couple of inches away from Isaac and hissing something too quiet for me to make out.
 Whatever it was, Vincent was all but foaming at the mouth while Isaac was so controlled it was hard to believe a fight was about to break out.

I don’t know how long it would have taken to have gotten over that.
 If ever.
 Karen – (laughing) That is almost the exact same thing happened to my cousin.
 Well, she didn’t tell him that he was evil, just inadequate.
 And that after living with him, she decided that men weren’t for her.
 He never lived it down.
 Nobody in the family would let him live it down.
 We teased him all the time about it.
 Art – Has he shot himself yet?
 Or someone else?

That’s what you really have to talk about, the lyrics.
 I don’t think anyone would claim any rock song is today’s “The Second Coming,” –except, maybe some critics who want to call Dylan our Dante.
 But, the words are what’s become important.
 I mean, the beat, the beat gets the thing listened to, and the words keep it being sung.
 In a sense it’s a con game—suck them in with the beat and make them listen.
 Right?
 What was I saying?
 CM:  	The bootleg—
 BG: 	Right.
 Anyway, that’s a long-winded way of saying, you try to get your stuff right, you try to make it matter.

But when it comes to important things, like knowing what a woman wants, well they’re hopeless.
 Even on the rare occasions that they actually are paying one hundred percent attention to us, which doesn’t happen as often as it should.
 They’re just simple minded, and it’s better that you learn than now than later.
 Otherwise you might end up like me, and that doesn’t seem to appeal to you very much.
 Liz – (A slight warming) Thank you for the advice, I’ll try to keep it in mind when I deal with men.
 Cleo – My pleasure baby, it’s the only motherly thing I can pass on to you.

Most likely what Imeralda sensed was simply a trade caravan running a regular route from Chrisana Stone to any of several of the Eastern Realms cities.
 If it was a light scouting patrol of just two or three guards that was coming; it would be the best case scenario for them to take on some Immortalist Guards and gain better weapons, armor and horses.
 Of course, if it was a slave caravan then they would simply sit and watch, as it would be suicide to do anything against a full patrol.
 Rodregas heard a rustle in the brush and glanced over to make sure it was just a squirrel or the like.
 He started to jump up as a humanoid shape appeared out of the trees, until he saw that it was just Imeralda.
 She seemed to be paying less attention now to stealth as she was to speed.
 From Imeralda’s expression Rodregas knew it was something more dangerous than a trade caravan coming down the road.
 Imeralda squatted down next to them and whispered, “A slave caravan is coming; it’s small but they have a score of guards.
 We need to back up before they get here.” “We have good cover here,” he whispered back, “let’s check them out as they pass.
 They are probably going to stop at Stallion’s Perch.” After much debate between the three of them Stallion’s Perch was their destination, a small keep that was known to breed Dire horses for the Immortal Guard.

 I started college and rented an apartment with Kenny Niedermeyer who was suffering more than any of us over Eric’s death, since the car was his and Sylvia blamed him.
 She would call and scream “Murderer!” and accuse him of stealing the twenty dollars Eric took with him that day.
 Here's something she wrote and sent him: Jingle for Rope Jumpers Teddy Bear, Teddy Bear, Eric's dead.
 They pushed him, and they beat him and they smashed him in the head.
 He gurgled and he growled, he suffered and he bled.
 Teddy Bear, Teddy Bear, Eric's dead.

My love for him and our effort and commitment to him as his parents wasn’t as strong as his desire to ingest Oxy.
 Brandon’s addiction to this drug was more powerful than anything I could offer and all the love Lisa and I could show.
 My wife woke to my screaming and she was as shocked as I was when I showed her the test results.
 Brandon had to want to get better.
 As he packed his meager belongings, I grabbed the hand held video player and replayed the footage I had taped of him detoxing.
 He begged me to stop the video as he could hear himself on it screaming in agony as his body craved this drug.
 Brandon was crying uncontrollably as he tried to look away from the video that I continued to shove in front of his face.
 Lisa stood there pale and exhausted, frightened like the night of his intervention.
 As I remember it, she resembled my mother, so many years before, when we visited Thomas in prison.
 Lisa could not add even a word.

 Her tears began coming faster.
 He tried to draw her closer, but she stiffened and then stood up.
 “Where-where are those books about time travel?” she asked, wiping her eyes.
 “In my office.” “I want to look at them again to see if I can find something that we missed.” “OK—I’ll help you.” “No.”  She shook her head, glancing at him but unable to meet his gaze.
 “I-I need to do it alone, OK?” “OK.” He watched her go, his heart heavy.
 He couldn’t stand to see her so unhappy, but he didn’t want her to leave.
 He loved her.
 He headed upstairs to make sure she’d found all the books and articles.

 You’ve left a lot of people out, too, of course.

The trap was clever, but the other wolves didn't know the terrain well enough.
 I let my beast bubble up from the corner of my being where I usually kept it chained.
 Between one moment and the next, I went from running on four legs to two.
 As my transformation ended, a six-foot tower of muscle and claws sprang from the shadows.
 I ducked Vincent's first blow and retaliated with a gash that opened one side of his chest nearly down to the bone.
 A dark-furred form leaped at Jasmin, but the other wolf mistimed the spring.
 Most of the other pack didn't appreciate just how nimble she was.
 Jasmin dodged to one side and then the two of them were circling, looking for an opening.
 Vincent, the other hybrid, attacked with the strength and fury that'd earned him the position of second in his pack, but he hadn't been expecting to face me in this form.
 As a wolf I weighed in at a solid two hundred pounds, but would've still given up more than a hundred pounds to him.

Yet even this is not enough.
 Otherwise, we would already have accomplished many of our goals.
 Above and beyond these material, social and financial resources, we need a new vision, a new perspective and new attitudes about what can and must be done.
 If the events of the past seven years prove anything, it is that a massive change of attitude and perspective, such as the one brought about between East and West, is imminently possible and incredibly powerful.
 The one we have all been party to has immensely altered the world’s political and economic landscape – sweeping away at a single stroke the very real danger of another world war and widespread nuclear destruction.
 The recommendations formulated in this report call for profound changes in the way we think, feel and act to meet the challenges and tap the opportunities of the coming decade.
 We should not underestimate the magnitude of the changes required or the collective effort needed to bring them about.
 Nor, as recent events confirm, should we under estimate the capacity of humankind to make these changes and realize the benefits.
 During the twentieth century, humankind has achieved an unprecedented mastery of its physical and social environment – soaring into space and landing on the moon, exploring the ocean floors, harnessing the power of the atom, delving into the secrets of the human brain and creating machines that imitate many of its functions, unravelling our own genetic code, generating unimagined wealth for many, proliferating national and global institutions, evolving the rudimentary foundations of world governance.
 Yet the very magnitude of these accomplishments has generated a sense of dependence and even helplessness.

I had to leave and run to Fariste to get Jordaan to come.” She was smiling like the sun as she spoke.
 “He was so good to come and just leave at the last moment,” she added.
 Rodregas thought she was going to start hugging the Nymph again, but she caught herself and came over to him and gave him a careful hug and started fussing with his pillows.
 Rodregas wanted to pull her closer and inhale her scent.
 He had thought that he was going to die, an experience that Rodregas of late knew too often.
 He wanted to pull Imeralda down into the bed and celebrate being alive.
 His body was probably too weak to do more than cuddle, but Imeralda seemed to be acting very friendly with the healer.
 Rodregas was not sure if something had changed between them while he was healing.
 The possibility that he had lost what they had just started to explore together made Rodregas’ heart heavy.
 “So, I have been wanting to ask you a question,” said Jordaan.

“Alright, then you can come this morning.
 We’ve got to hurry though, or we’ll be late.”
 “I am ready,” Qurrah said.
 “When _you_ are ready, lead on.”
 The big half-orc flew about their home, grabbing his old swords and donning his faded leather armor.
 When ready, he nodded to Qurrah, who let out a rare laugh.
 “You are amusing, brother,” was all he said before following him out.

The four of us, Brandon, Bryce, Lisa and myself, drove together several hours north to a coastal town in northern California.
 We all stayed in the same quaint roadside motel near a popular camping spot called Patrick’s Point.
 It was woodsy and cool and we shared a two-bedroom unit with a common kitchen and a family room with a fireplace.
 It wasn’t much but it was everything to my wife and me.
 We took long walks as a family and we talked like we hadn’t in years, or possibly ever.
 We sat by the fireplace and cooked meals together in this tiny motel kitchen.
 We hiked one day through the forest and climbed a small mountain where we stood together and looked out at the beauty of the nature that surrounded us.
 When your children are young you have many special moments and they pass by so fast because they are so frequent.
 People always warn you how fast your children will grow and one day it happens and you realize that you were warned.
 When your children get old enough to move out of your home, you have very few opportunities to have special family moments and that makes them even more wonderful.

I knew Lisa wanted to help Brandon and we both knew my involvement would require a venture into unchartered territory but I needed her to know everything.
 Lisa and I had been married for twenty-four years and we knew what lay ahead would be a bigger test of our commitment than what I had just done.
 We needed to help Brandon and I needed to believe this would also help the kids I was attempting to bust, just as my son getting busted was one step closer to hitting bottom, and hopefully one step closer to getting off of these powerful drugs.
 There was no turning back now.
 Before I got home from my massage, my crack-berry phone rang and it was Ashley.
 She called me to ask if I could bring her a few Oxys to hold her over for the night.
 I, of course, didn’t have any Oxys so I told her I couldn’t get out and we could do the whole deal at once.
 I couldn’t help but feel sorrow for her and guilt for what I was doing but I justified it in my mind that she needed to get away from this guy and that she needed to get help for her drug problem as well.
 I pictured my son and his willingness to do anything to get his next fix.
 When I arrived at home I called Officer White’s phone and told him I had a drug deal set up with Steve and Ashley and they wanted one hundred Oxy pills.

My head knew all I'd done was sit motionless while performers portrayed a fictional story.
 The rest of me felt as though I had just risked life and limb, seen people I loved killed, and played a small but tangible part in altering the course of history.
 Returning to my mundane, ever so boring life was an incredible letdown, but that didn't explain the hollow sensation that'd lodged itself somewhere between my heart and stomach.
 Illogical as it sounded, the only explanation for feeling as though a part of me had been ripped out and lost was Alec's having disappeared sometime between the last note and the final bow.
 It was unsettling.
 Even my growing feelings for Brandon didn't hint at that kind of need.
 It was a pale shadow of what it felt like to lose a family member, but it was made up of too many of the same elements.
 One of the chaperons, an over-bleached woman who looked like she was struggling to deny her last eight or nine birthdays, had to call my name at least twice to shake me out of my funk.
 I followed everyone else out to the bus, but there wasn't any refuge there.
 I was just too different from everyone else.

 “You know I am a sorceress.
 My time should be spent studying my craft.
 I only wanted to be proficient with my staff, not a master.”
 A tiny bit of panic crept into Harruq’s voice.

Come on, let’s get the horses over to the old barn and get them set for the night before it gets too dark.” “Are those the two Dire Cats from Raven Keep?” asked Imeralda.
 As she spoke she shook her long auburn hair behind her, something he was starting to realize was a nervous gesture.
 “Yes, I think so,” Rodregas said.
 “I freed them from the dungeon before I left, and then I thought I saw them yesterday.
 Apparently, everyone in the dungeon is following me,” he said with a chuckle.
 “You saw them?” asked Doi’van.
 “Not exactly” he said.
 “I saw movement a few times.
 I just thought it might be them.
 I did not know for sure,” he explained.

The whole purpose of this little exercise is to convince your mom you've been safely home this entire time.
 If you crash later in the day, she's going to know you didn't sleep tonight."
 "Maybe if you stayed with me it would help me sleep."
 I almost couldn't believe those words were really coming out of my mouth.
 I wanted to blame it on how close he was standing, or how tired I was, or anything else that might be remotely believable, but based on how serious his face had just become, it was too late to take it all back.
 "That doesn't strike me as being a much better solution."
 I felt my neck and face begin to burn from embarrassment.
 I took a step back, and reached for the door, hoping to beat a quick retreat before I could humiliate myself further, but he stopped me with a surprisingly gentle hand.
 "I'm sorry; that didn't come out as intended.
 If it would help you sleep, of course I'll come upstairs and sit with you.

 “Just one god, Qurrah,” Velixar corrected.

 His arms and legs bulged with muscle.
 He flexed his arm and stared at the growth that traveled all the way up to his neck.
 He felt within himself a lifewell of energy, one infinitely deep.

I wasn’t sure what to do, and I looked toward Chevelle out of desperation.
 He was watching me, surprise clear on his face.
 Whatever I’d been accused of, he hadn’t expected it.
 The council elders mistook the exchange as an answer.
 “Chevelle Vattier, you have led this fusion?” His head whipped back toward the council table and he shot out a forceful, “No.” They focused once more on me.
 “I ask again, Elfreda, who taught you the magic to seal yourself to the crystal?” I was at a loss.
 I stood, helpless, as Chevelle spoke up.
 “Elfreda.” He’d used my given name, I hoped simply because we were in a formal setting and not because of whatever horrible thing I had been accused of.
 He was pleading now.
 “Where did you learn how to fuse the pendant with your blood?” Fuse the pendant with my blood?

English went better.
 Mr. Whethers got the class involved in a discussion of Heathcliff's motivations, which kept everyone occupied for the full class time, and distracted me from what was likely to happen when Britney and I got to algebra.
 As we walked back to our lockers between classes, I noticed that the halls seemed strangely empty.
 Britney rolled her eyes when I asked why.
 "Of course nobody's here.
 Tonight's the full moon, and there was a monster party last night.
 There'll be another tonight and then again tomorrow."
 I felt my eyes go big.

Even Jessica was nothing less than stunning, and I didn't look as bad as normal.
 Jasmin's backless black dress and shoulder-length gloves had streaks of blue that brought out her eyes, while Dominic's tight, red gown seemed to give her the confidence and poise you'd expect from someone so gorgeous and utterly exotic.
 Jess had opted for a sleeveless silver number that flared out at the bottom so much I wasn't sure how Isaac would be able to walk next to her without stepping on the shimmery material.
 Rachel's mauve dress was probably the most conservative of all, neither over-snug, nor especially low-cut.
 It had seemed entirely out of character considering what she'd purchased for the rest of us, but when I'd asked, she'd just grimaced and said Alec would've made her stay home if she'd chosen anything more daring.
 None of which helped me feel any more comfortable in the tight, strapless wonder Rachel had been so excited to give me.
 Even with all of the weight I'd lost since the accident, it still felt like the material was fighting a losing battle to stretch itself over my frame.
 I'd been hoping to be able to put off actually putting the dress on for at least another half hour, but when my makeup had finally been pronounced satisfactory, Jasmin had studied me for a few minutes, pulled my hair back, secured it with a pair of silver combs I was worried might actually contain genuine diamonds, and then helped Rachel cram me into the dress.
 If Jessica hadn't grudgingly complimented me on just how good my hair looked, I might have suspected Jasmin was trying to purposefully make me look worse than the other girls.
 Dominic and Rachel had to tell me I looked good, that was an unwritten girl-rule regardless of what species you were.

Inspired by the way he was toying with her hair, she asked, "Would you like to have a lock of my hair?"
 "That's a great idea."
 He bent to inhale its fragrance.
 She took scissors from a drawer and reached for a lock on the back of her head.
 She snipped one off and handed it to Rick.
 "We should find a ribbon to tie it so that the strands won't come lose."
 He fingered the silky lock.
 This was all he'd have left of her.
 Swallowing, he nodded.
 "I don't have any, but I'll buy one.

“Oh, don’t misjudge my words.
 I did not mean to imply any misdeeds of our valiant Knights of the Soaring Heavens.
 I am not aware of any of them doing much of anything, much less kill an Immortalist.” “Than what should I keep my eye out for?” asked Van’dret.
 He was becoming even more curious to the direction of the conversation.
 “You, my fine Van’dret, are more in the world than most of us.
 You are out traveling and adventuring, while most of us Immortalist just sit in our towers.
 I have always thought that our one weakness was our isolation.
 It is hard to know what is exactly happening when we are not out to see it.”  For a moment, Taiga paused, looking up at the crystal roof overhead in apparent contemplation of the possible implications of their isolated natures.
 After a moment, in which Van’dret waited patiently, Taiga continued, “You are one of our best, and yet you are also in the world.
 The tournament draws the powerful and those who wish to be powerful.

Most likely he’ll just get chased off by some angry tourists.
 Liz – What’s he done that is worse than this?
 And what did he mean when he said ‘you’re good at this sort of thing.’
 Jim – He didn’t mean anything by it.
 Liz – He meant something by it, otherwise he wouldn’t have said anything.
 Now what did you do?
 Jim – you know Gene, he says thing all the time.
 He was just being Gene.
 Liz – What did you do?
 You didn’t give him the idea to tell the anorexics that they were fat did you?

In the morning, we ate pancakes that Emily’s mom had made us and set off for the park.
 We happened to run into Jason and Seth half way and at the same time watched a pole freeze in the middle of July.
 You don’t get to see that every day, which usually meant there was a monster involved.
 Jason, Seth and Emily saw it too because I was chasing after them as we all ran for the few trees ahead.
 In a few seconds I had a complete view of the culprit.
 And strange enough it was a frost beast.
 Frost beasts are the cutest monsters you’ll ever see.
 They’re the size of medium dogs and their pelts are a light, icy blue.
 They may be cute but if you don’t watch out, they could easily be the most dangerous monsters around.
 Don’t let them breath on you, or you’ll freeze to death.

“If you must ask then you did not, at least not directly, though I did hear you startle awake.
 Perhaps a fleeting glimpse of it…”
 “Qurrah,” Harruq said, crossing his arms and frowning at him.
 “What is this about?
 Tell me.”
 “Remember the necromancer we witnessed at the siege?” Qurrah asked.
 “It is him.
 He has haunted my dreams lately, and today he whispered the name of a place I have already researched for my own purposes.
 I think we are being guided, though I dare not pretend to know why.”
 Harruq shifted, the dark expression on his brother’s face making him uncomfortable.

“Then why don’t we just walk over, say hello, and then whack ’em?” Harruq asked.
 “My dear brother,” Qurrah said, “that is a very good question.”
 Brazenly, they approached the campfire.
 They kept their weapons sheathed and hidden.
 The closer they got before the men panicked the better.
 “Halt, who goes there?” one of the guards shouted to them as they neared.
 They wore polished chainmail shining red in the firelight.
 The crest of Neldar adorned their tabards.
 Longswords hung from their belts.
 “Me be Harruq Tun!” the half-orc said as he stepped further into the light, grinning stupidly.

The beast froze the first few into harmless ice cubes but finally went down when one got past its defenses.
 Behind his body appeared seven Thrashers and many more Frost beasts.
 It was like a monster reunion.
 I’ve never seen so many in one place before.
 A Thrasher pack had at least six or seven but there must have been more than ten monsters total.
 It was scary.
 Right then, right at that very moment, I knew something was terribly wrong.
 They all stopped in front of us, all those pairs of angry eyes staring at us.
 They made me confused, from the warm feeling the Frost Beasts gave me to the cold feeling the Thrashers inflicted.
 They exchanged some sort of signal, including grunts and yips, and slowly advanced on us.

I looked away before anyone could see me staring.
 Britney was still looking longingly at a pile of fries.
 When I looked up again Brandon was looking back at me with a smile that communicated all kinds of things I'd always thought you needed words for.
 His expression seemed to say he was glad to see me, embarrassed to be the center of attention, and sorry he couldn't get away from his friends to come over and say hi.
 I felt my face go hot with embarrassment.
 I tried to step behind a pillar before he saw me go bright red, but knew I hadn't succeeded.
 I bit my lip as I realized how spastic I was being.
 I'd spent the last sixteen-plus years suppressing my natural tendency to form crushes on one cute boy after another.
 I'd nearly perfected the art of exhibiting zero interest in the opposite sex.
 The whole point of my existence had been avoiding the kinds of things that'd result in everyone laughing at me.

Obviously, people acted so boorishly because they weren't as cool or enlightened as me.
 During mass, I considered the priest's accent monotonous and uninspired, as though after forty years of mouthing the same lines, it all sounded to him like blah blah blah.
 Attending Catholic services, communion tries my patience, as I'm not allowed to participate.
 But while a young woman read, “He took bread, gave thanks and broke it and gave it to them, saying, ‘This is my body given for you.
 Do this in remembrance .
 .
 .’” and the choir chanted, “Sing hallelujah to the Lord” a breath of Spirit touched me.
 Through all the minutes while wafers got distributed, I heard a small voice reminding me that I ought to pluck the log out of my own eye.
 So I was slightly less mean by the time Mother Teresa walked to the altar.
 In strong yet gentle English, she said, “Let us ask Our Lady to give us her heart, so that we will offer service to the poorest of the poor.” Neither weathered skin nor stooped shoulders could alter the beauty she exhibited, as she recited from the Gospel of Matthew.

I am seated next to Grandpa but I am now flat on the ground with the rest of the crowd attempting to duck the flying flowers, tripods, and debris, expecting a shower of bullets.
 Chairs are scattering as they tip over and who knows what those two men in the helicopter are going to do?
 I look up and the only man standing is Grandpa who has his arms in the air as the wind from the copter pounds him and ripples his suit like a flag in the wind.
 This deeply religious (and senile) old man proclaims loudly “the lord has come to take my son!” and he continues to repeat this line as if he is a TV preacher in a revival tent.
 I have an eye on the copter and a hand on Grandpa’s leg as I attempt to pull him to the ground with the rest of us.
 People are barely audible but they are screaming and crying and in total panic.
 The men reach inside the helicopter and they hold what appear to be large boxes.
 They turn the boxes over in all this mayhem; something dumps out in large clumps banging down on the top of the cars and limos they hover over.
 The loud bangs cause those who aren’t looking to think they are explosions or gunfire.
 A closer look at these clumps reveals that they are flowers!

I tried to respond to his greeting, but felt choked and instead only nodded back, my mouth tight as I endeavored to grin with a now clenched jaw.
 I groaned internally, keeping on the path, not daring to look back in case he was behind me.
 I was convinced he was.
 He wouldn’t be taking the back way to Junnie’s as I had come, and he wouldn’t be leaving the village without a pack; he was likely going to a Council meeting.
 Yes, he was certainly right behind me, following me into town.
 Somehow I made it to the library without tripping or looking back, though I was nearly overcome with the temptation to turn at the door to see him one more time.
 The library steps curled around the interior of the tree, shelves cut into every space above and below, tables and racks and patrons scattered about the remaining areas.
 I found a dark, empty corner on the third level and relaxed onto a seat, leaning against the inside wall of the old tree and taking in the scent of ancient paper and binding.
 After a momentary pause to blot out the latest incident of poor self-control, I decided to attempt to locate the missing pages by magic.
 I had, after all, succeeded in growing only days ago.

"Here!
 I'm lost!"
 But then she saw him and ran to him, throwing her arms around him.
 "I couldn't get back home!"
 "Shhh, shhh--it's all right."
 He hugged her, rocking her gently.
 "How am I going to get back, Rick?
 Am I stuck here forever?"
 "Come on--let's go have some breakfast, and we'll see what else we can think of."
 She let him lead her back to his house.

 It all comes from heartache and passion and hard-won honesty.
 At least, I hope so.

She snickered.
 “Okay whatever you say, Jazell.” “We have to tell you guys something,” I told her and Jason about how the dwarf had showed up and what he said about Igneeria.
 Emily listened quietly but when I got to the part that we were supposed to go there, her mouth fell open.
 “That’s completely crazy!” Emily gasped.
 “We’re supposed to just leave and go there?
 What about our parents?” “He told me, and I quote, ‘Miss did you not think that her majesty would have this all planned out?
 You don’t have to worry.’ I personally think it’s all a little skeptical, don’t you?” “Yes,” she said, digging for a pencil and paper from my bag, “I do.
 We don’t even know who this ‘majesty’ is and if this information is reliable.
 I understand the Half-way part, that makes sense, but the destiny part doesn’t.” I sighed and sat down on the log.
 “The dwarf said to meet him tomorrow morning near ‘the thorn that reaches the sky.’ What does that mean anyway?” Jason stepped over and spoke instead of Emily, who was furiously writing everything down, as if she’d forget in a couple of seconds, “It could be a description of something in town, maybe a building or a landmark.” I suddenly got an idea and took another piece of paper out.

"One time," I said, "I was suffering panic attacks.
 I guess that time, it was the comfort motive.” “Did it work?” she asked.
 “Sure, gradually.
 And then, another time, when I decided to actually find a church I would go to more than once or twice, was on account of feeling quite blessed and knowing I ought to be spending more time thanking God than I ever would on my own.” “How did you know which church to pick?” Such a question calls for more coffee.
 I pour a cup and say, “Well, the evangelical ones were where I found more people who actually tried to get closer to God.
 You know, to better understand God through all kinds of means.
 Intellect and others.
 I mean, I’m all for preachers showing how Biblical advise can help us be nicer, more prosperous, more benevolent, more likely to work toward human rights and all.
 But without the honest search for connection with the Holy Spirit, none of that good advice carries much weight.”

“It will not be safe to travel in my company,” he added.
 “I know,” stated the Hellborn in a voice that was so deep it was like stones grinding.
 “But still, I would travel with you.” Again he made the statement and showed no interest in explaining his action.
 “Actually,” added Imeralda shaking her long curly hair behind her as if to clear the way for her decision, “I was thinking the same thing.
 I am not safe from the Guild anyhow.
 My natural magical talent is very strong, and until I am better skilled in it, I am very vulnerable,” she stated “And frankly, while Audrian, Brit and Geor are very brave to let me travel with them, I fear that I put their lives in danger.
 You, on the other hand, are in more danger than I am, and should be even more motivated to stay out of the sight of the Guild.” After saying the little speech that she had clearly been practicing in her head, she added, “Joining you makes sense.” Rodregas hesitated, but she had an excellent point, and of course turning away such a beautiful young woman was a difficult thing to do.
 She did have a point and he did have a reasonably safe place to hide that he had been heading toward.
 So, even if he did head out on a raid of the Immortalists, she should be safe enough.
 The human men would be of least interest to the Guild and the easiest to blend in.

It took less than half a second for him to figure out who I was talking about.
 "They don't hate you.
 A few of them are scared almost senseless, but nobody hates you."
 "They were willing to kill me.
 They wanted to trade me back to Brandon."
 It came out as something less than a whisper, but apparently Alec's hearing was acute enough to catch that too.
 Alec drew me close, heedless of the open door and the twenty staring kids.
 He placed the side of his face against mine and whispered into my ear.
 "I'm not going to let anything happen to you.
 If there's a way to keep you safe I'll find it."

Silently groaning at my fashion faux pas, I located a sign pointing towards the office, and slipped around a couple of jocks who paused in their manly mock boxing match just long enough to check out the new girl.
 I silently hoped they slipped and hit each other in the nose.
 I wandered down the white-walled corridor until I found another sign and turned left.
 There was a tall brunette already waiting, so I took a seat in one of the hard-plastic chairs.
 The other girl had shorts on just like everyone else, but hers were the shortest I'd seen yet.
 In Minnesota you could always pick out the alpha females by the length of their shorts, and this one seemed to think she was at the top of the food chain.
 That or a complete slut, but with her tan skin and perfect wavy hair, I figured it was probably the former.
 She didn't look like she had to put out to get attention.
 Two minutes later, a smiling blond secretary came waddling out of what was probably the principal's office.
 I spent the time wondering if I should try to make small talk; the gorgeous girl spent it staring out the window.

One of the hardest things I have ever done is accompany my mother to Texas to visit her son, my brother Thomas, in prison.
 Over the years I have seen her strive to survive situations no person should ever be subjected to, but this visit crushed her.
 The plane ride there was difficult and we spoke very little.
 The town was a dump of cheap motels and crappy food joints tailored towards the needs of those who visited convicted criminals in this maximum-security prison.
 Walking her through the doors as they searched us both was humiliating.
 I couldn’t take my eyes off of my mother as the event itself seemed to drain the life out of her.
 We visited Thomas just the one day and although he physically looked fine, he was an inmate in a sea of prison issue clothing surrounded by armed guards behind tall razor wire fences.
 I will never forget that moment in my life.
 At barely twenty-two years old I was convinced that my life was ruined.
 I was moving back to Sacramento from Lake Tahoe after losing my business and my fiancée Karen to my cocaine-snorting partner and former best friend, Pete.

She writhed beneath his weight, moaning.
 She'd never be able to leave him once they'd made love.
 His mouth ravaged hers as he pressed her deeper into the cushions.
 Panting, he raised his head and pulled back enough to unbutton her blouse.
 Marie gazed up into his eyes.
 "I love you, Rick."
 He froze.
 Her eyes were clear and loving and .

“Do your best to convince Aurelia not to fight,” he said, his voice quieter than normal.
 “Do everything you can.
 Make her listen.”
 “I don’t want to kill her,” Harruq whispered.
 “Will you if you must?”
 The half-orc did not answer.
 Qurrah stepped around and stared into his brother’s eyes.
 “If we meet her on the field of battle, if we fight her, she might attack me instead of you.
 Her or me, brother.

Darcy, the artist who could draw better at three years old than I could when she was three and I was thirty three, majored in painting and photography in college and graduated then worked as a newspaper designer but soon turned to teaching.
 She teaches fifth grade kids so underprivileged that not one in her last year’s class of twenty-seven had ever participated in an organized sport.
 She loves the kids, so she’s always developing some new method, like creating a bi-weekly newspaper and having them write columns on their favorite subjects or assigning them to design their dream house and using the assignment to teach basic geometry.
 In summer, at the Boy’s and Girl’s Club, she teaches art to teenagers, most of them troubled or in trouble.
 Darcy’s great because her giant’s heart is open and she uses her brains and imagination in generous ways.
 And Cody’s one of those most-rare people who have all the tools.
 He’s strong, smart, industrious, and even handsomer than his dad.
 He’ll graduate with a B.A.
 next year with near-perfect grades and two minors, in Latin and Spanish.
 Still, his greatness, the character trait that makes me hope someday we’ll find a President like him, is his devotion to do whatever is good and right, though it might be the hardest way.

 “There is no hurry,” he tried to persuade me.
 “There is,” I insisted.
 “I am running.” I didn’t know why I chose that word.
 I wasn’t bound here.
 Leaving would have sufficed, but it felt like running, felt like escape.
 And I knew I was trapped.
 Someone would stop me.
 Yes, I was running.
 My head swung to locate a noise at the edge of the clearing behind me.

I guess she has pretty good reason to be, but she hasn't even given me a chance to apologize."
 The first half of Rachel's comment finally sank in, and I nearly tripped.
 "Wait, what dance?"
 "Ashure Day.
 It's an...a local tradition.
 Think of it kind of like earth day, but with a dance.
 Kind of like a pagan Prom.
 Or maybe a pagan homecoming since it's still fall."
 Prom was my arch-nemesis.
 There were really only two times a year that the universe managed to penetrate my historical indifference to the opposite sex.

A bridge might mean a village was nearby, and a village meant elves.
 I didn’t want to get caught, not after all this, so I was fully prepared to run by the time I reached the crossing.
 Its stacked gray stones were bulkier than those that had been appearing more frequently on my path.
 Water flowed beneath, smoothing the stones at the base.
 They were so worn, it must have been in place for centuries.
 The leather soles of my shoes skimmed over ancient stone, the bridge curving gently before flattening out into a worn dirt path on the other side.
 It was more traveled than I would have liked, so I swung wide, through the trees instead.
 The wind shifted and the scent of roasting meat assaulted me, dragging my attention, my feet, its way.
 Despite my concerns about other elves, my stomach tightened, my mouth watering as I followed it through the trees.
 They broke into a small clearing, and there in the center stood a cloaked figure, kneeling down as he turned a meat-covered spit.

“Dreams,” I complained.
 She smiled as she sat on the bed beside me.
 “Some seek out the breath.
 They say it is foresight.” “Foresight?” She nodded.
 “What did you see?” She raised an eyebrow questioningly.
 “Not the future.” She laughed.
 “Have a bath.
 You’ll be good as new.” The water was coming in the window again and I wondered at what I had just read.
 Surely the dust and fog were meddling with my thoughts.
 “Chevelle will be swapping with us for the evening,” she explained.

He'd stayed home from work to be with her, and he'd held her.
 And he hadn't been upset that she'd broken up with Davis.
 He just wanted her to be happy.
 That was what Rick wanted for her.
 Tears tightened her throat as she remembered the anguish on his face when he'd told her that he was the key to the doorway to 1927.
 He'd desperately wanted to keep her with him, to marry her, and he could have kept his discovery to himself and never told her he knew how to help her get home.
 But he'd wanted what was best for her.
 Hanging the housedress in the closet again, she stripped off her dress and extra set of underwear and put on Rick's t-shirt.
 Curling up on the bed, she stroked one sleeve.
 She wondered what Rick was doing right now.

During the first half of 1994, 36 armed conflicts were in progress.
 During the past year, more than half a million people perished in Somalia and Rwanda alone.
 Nearly 100 less-known conflicts rage at the present moment.
 Refugees: Violence, poverty and environmental degradation are displacing people on a massive scale.
 Today there are more than 18 million refugees, far more than the number immediately following the Second World War.
 A rising tide of immigration is increasing ethnic tensions and intolerance in both industrial and developing countries.
 Debt: Outside the industrial countries, global growth in the last two decades has come from a limited number of countries in East and South East Asia.
 Income inequalities are increasing rapidly, even between developing countries.
 More than 60 countries are unable to meet their debt obligations.
 Many are facing depressed prices for primary commodities, upon which they rely for their export earnings and debt servicing.

 Liz – What are you doing?
 Jim – Just in case the answer was no, and your mom comes back.
 The Boy Scout motto is ‘be prepared.’  I try to live by that motto.
 Liz – You were never a Boy Scout.
 Jim – That doesn’t mean that I can’t adopt their motto, its just good common sense to be prepared.
 Liz – Jim, you’re never prepared for anything.
 Jim – Sure I am.
 Liz – Oh yeah?

That was a fail, I scolded myself.
 A FAIL!
 “Nice try,” Seth whispered and I think he really meant it.
 Or maybe he was teasing me.
 It’s hard to tell in these situations.
 Seth brandished his sword.
 “My turn.” “Really, warrior?” Kojas said and laughed.
 His laugh was like a bunch of spiders running down my back.
 “You think your sword will do any more than the pathetic archer girl’s arrow?” “Hey,” I shouted, “I’m not a pathetic archer girl!” Oh course, the two ignored me.
 I swear the air sizzled with the tension between Kojas and Seth.

Without ceremony, they were kicked through, both falling to the dirt and scraping their knees.
 “Get going,” one said.
 “See if somewhere else will take your mutt ass.”
 It was not just adrenaline that caused Harruq’s hands to shake, but Qurrah put his hand on his wrist and begged him to calm.
 “Never forget this shame,” he said.
 “Let it burn in you.
 Let it be a reminder of what I have always said.
 We are better, superior.
 Never feel guilt at what we do to them, for you see what they would do to us.”
 Harruq stood, brushed some dirt from his pants, and then offered Qurrah a hand.

This time, he would not just cry out to the gods about the injustice while innocent people burned.
 He filled his lungs with stale air tainted with burning pitch and tried to sink into the mindless guard mentality that kept him functioning for the past decade and a half.
 Once a man loses all hope of a decent life, it is astonishing what he will do to stay alive.
 For the last twenty years his following orders and doing his duty, along with his better than average training for a guard, had served him well.
 He had been safe from the bounty on his head and for the most part.
 His life was more boring than anything else.
 He approached the door to the tower roof with the prisoners.
 Instead of formulating a plan of action his mind kept going back to the horror of last week's practice when his master, Ravenhurr, demanded a rehearsal of the ritual ceremony with the senior guards.
 At the time he assumed they would merely walk through the procedure.
 Ravenhurr, however, was the kind of man who demanded perfection.

 "Yes.

Today, vast sections in developing countries are stirred to action because their expectations are not fulfilled.
 Economic liberalization has unleashed people’s expectations: witness the rush of Chinese peasants to invest in the stock market and the increasing demand of Indian villagers for a range of consumer goods.
 The same movement continues in the West as increased physical and social mobility, the growing demand for higher education and the widespread urge for greater recreation and travel.
 These expectations are the seed and driving force for social progress.
 They provide the energy and create the openness and willingness for change.
 But they also increase the danger of frustration, disappointment and violence.
 The end of the Cold War was expected to usher in an age of peace, but actually violence is on the rise in both developing and developed countries because of the widening gap between human expectations and achievements.
 This growing gap between expectations and achievements is at the root of contemporary turbulence worldwide.
 The popular and some times violent demand for freedom and participatory democracy, the return of religion in politics, surging ethno-nationalism and intolerance, and rising urban crime are disparate expressions of this phenomenon.
 In Eastern Europe, where a peaceful revolution from within has broken the shackles of statism that long confined the energies of people, these energies now surge forward in high and eager expectations of a better life.

The magnitude of the task and the prescription may vary, but the goal and determination can be shared by all.
 Employment Strategies for the Industrial Nations
 In the industrial countries, the phenomena of jobless growth coupled with persistently high rates of youth unemployment and of chronic unemployment among the poorer sections will not be eradicated by even the most optimistic rates of economic expansion or mere incremental adjustments within the context of present attitudes and policies.
 Although the problem has been aggravated by a variety of short- and medium-term factors whose effects will gradually dissipate over time – defence cuts, recession, East European economic crisis, German reunification, etc.
 – the present job crisis among Western nations is largely structural in nature.
 Although conditions vary from country to country, the crisis impacts most heavily on the unskilled, young people, urban poor, ethnic minorities and older workers.
 Specific programmes to effect structural changes will have to be introduced in order to ensure a fair opportunity to all, especially minority youth, to lead economically active lives.
 It is in this context that the European Union, the United States and other Western governments have been considering ambitious proposals for addressing this issue.
 The Australian government has unveiled a $4.6 billion jobs package to reduce unemployment from 10 per cent to 5 per cent by the end of the decade by encouraging training for the young, the unskilled and the long-term unemployed.
 Recently the OECD has presented the main planks of an employment strategy to stimulate economic growth in the industrial nations, make labour markets more flexible, increase productivity, and revamp employment and unemployment security provisions.

“The two brothers were arrogant to think they could create a paradise with a creature so full of faults as man,” Velixar continued.
 “I saw the battle waged in the small town of Haven, there in the center of the delta.
 It is an awesome thing to watch gods duel.
 Ashhur fled before either could strike a killing blow.
 I summoned our armies, as did the priests of Ashhur.
 Think now of the many deformed creatures that walk this world.
 Know they were all mere animals before the gods turned them into soldiers for their war.
 The elves were vicious in this time, slaying any who dared come near their forests.
 But some elves did side with Karak, determined to help end the war so the world could heal.”
 “Did Celestia not interfere?” Qurrah asked.

“Stop, you cannot defeat him,” she shouted.
 None listened.
 “Felewen, please!”
 Felewen glanced back to her, and that small pause saved her life.
 The man in black had made no threatening move as the other two charged.
 They were almost upon him when he cast aside his hood to reveal his ever-changing face, his deep red eyes, and his horrible smile.
 His hands lunged forward, the floodgates opened, and all his power came rushing forth.
 A wall of black magic rolled like a tidal wave conjured from his fingertips.
 The elven brothers tumbled through and vanished.
 Felewen leapt back when she saw the attack coming.

Jason hit Emily in the arm and she started yelling at.
 So, this is typical thing to wake up to.
 I stood up and walked over to Seth.
 He looked up from the ground and saw my troubled face.
 “What's wrong, Jazell?” “I need to speak to you,” I said in a low voice, “alone.” Seth nodded in understanding and I followed him out of the cave.
 We stood off to the side near the edge of the cliff where Emily and Jason couldn't see us.
 For a minute, I didn't say anything because I didn't know what to say.
 I hesitated, but knew that if I told anyone about the dream, it would be Seth.
 So what was the point in waiting?
 “I had a dream last night,” I began.

 "I'm sorry, honey.

 But I bet you'll walk back into 1927 when you least expect it."
 That thought depressed him.
 She saw the sadness in his eyes and leaned forward to lay her hand on his knee.

The peace force would intervene automatically and unconditionally – defensively and, if necessary, offensively – to protect the sovereignty and international borders of any member country, provided that it conformed to the rules under the charter.
 The organization could also assist members in fighting drug trafficking and terrorist activities.
 The benefits of this cooperative peace-keeping mechanism would be manifold:
 Since the charter would bind members and the alliance to eschew the use of force and aggression for any reason, it would represent a stabilizing, non-provocative, non-offensive defence.
 Its charter could also include specific provisions for close association with other international forces.
 Its combined strength and technological capabilities would exceed those of any of its members and constitute a substantial deterrent to aggression against any member country.
 It would significantly reduce the costs of security for members, possibly by up to 50 or 75 per cent, without compromising their legitimate security needs.
 The more members, the lower the defence expenditure required by each, both because the collective force would be larger and because the number of potential adversaries would be reduced proportionately.
 The organization of a World Army, run on well-defined and transparent lines with appropriate mechanisms for control and responsiveness, would help eliminate the need for countries to maintain their own large standing armies.
 Ultimately this could enable other nations to follow the lead of Costa Rica, which abolished its military forces several decades ago.

 Qurrah smirked as the guard captain hurried away.
 “Elves banned,” he said to his brother.
 “Amusing, though unnecessary.

 I've never heard of either of the shows, but she's offering me twenty thousand dollars for just three weeks."
 I felt my eyes go wide at the idea of something so unbelievable happening to us, and then even wider as I realized this must be what Alec had been referring to.
 'Convince her it's fine for her to leave' indeed.
 He hadn't been kidding about getting us out of the country.
 "Mom, you have to go!
 This is the biggest opportunity ever!"
 She looked doubtful.
 "Sweetie, I know it seems exciting, and heaven knows we could use the money, but that just isn't my kind of thing."

That summer before our senior year, Margaret's best friend was Pam Greenman, who attended our rival high school.
 Lane was someone I probably never would've befriended if not for Eric.
 Since we met in seventh grade, I had considered Lane a smart-mouthed little pest while he thought of me as a big, dumb oaf.
 In Eric's company, we each learned better.
 I have Eric's treasures, which Sylvia gave me.
 Along with them came a treasure of hers, a letter from Pam Greenman.
 She wrote, "One can't begin to talk about Eric because there is no beginning, just as there is no end.
 To say what he was would be impossible since he was so different to so many people.
 To me he was something intangible.
 You could hear him, feel him, see him, but you could never grasp hold of what there was inside of him that made him Eric.

Think of what’d happen with a drill sergeant.
 You’d spend all your time locked up.” Twice he made me promise to watch over Billy, to be like a big brother, since Billy wouldn’t have him anymore.
 I said, “Why doesn’t he have you anymore?” “I mean after I’m gone.” “Well, you’re still here,” I said.
 “Anyway, Billy’s got a real big brother.” “But Cliff won’t always be around.” “Well, if everybody else is going someplace, who says I won’t?” “I don’t think you will,” he said.
 “See, you believe you’re on your own, but you’re not.
 Your mom’s had it even rougher than you have, and you’re not going to leave her anytime soon.
 Not for long anyway.” He knew me better than I did.
 I had told him some part of me blamed myself for my dad’s first heart attack, the one that weakened him and probably set him up for the big one.
 On a sweltering summer day, I had teased him about being old when he declined to volunteer to keep score at a golf tournament I played in, though I knew all about his angina.
 He must've wanted me to believe in his strength.

 "No."
 "Well, maybe next door."

Her breath was fast and shallow.
 Her hair, which she had failed to tie up before the fight, hung in wild strands before her face.
 She was beautiful, but Harruq did not see it.
 To Harruq, she was the young girl cradling her sister.
 Aurelia thrust her right hand forward, her fingers spread wide and stiff.
 Words of power poured from her lips, and without hesitation the forest obeyed.
 Vines shot from the earth and wrapped around Harruq’s arms and legs.
 Down he went.
 Aurelia gave him no chance to recover.
 She raised her outstretched hand higher.

The sunlight through the windows was now indirect so he guessed it to be mid or even late afternoon.
 Again came the polite knock; no one would dare such persistence without direct orders from Ravenhurr.
 It had to be Adapt Korin.
 He nearly leaped off the bed and looked for a sword but of course there was none.
 He stepped in front of the bedroom door as he quickly did his best to close the broken study door.
 He quietly unlocked it and stepped back and said simply, “Enter,” and waited for the Adapt to come inside.
 Korin came into the room with a relaxed step that showed him to be much more comfortable than Rodregas was.
 Korin was a good looking man.
 It was always weird with him.
 He changed bodies so often that you always felt like you were meeting someone new, but it was not long before you realized that it was Korin.

They are opposites of the eternal balance of creation and destruction.
 But when mortals started to combine the various powers, the two eternal enemies agreed on one thing and this became ‘The One Law.’” “Mortals can work to become Gods through growing in Celestial Power, and they can even tap into the elemental powers.
 They also can become Infernals if they so wish, though I know of few who have tried.
 The chaotic and destructive nature of the infernal does not lead to the necessary discipline that is required to be an Immortalist.
 A mortal must choose only one path; Celestial or Infernal.
 That is ‘The One Law.’” “Why?” asked Doi’van, his deep voice sounding both menacing and curious.
 “Nobody knows for sure,” said Jordaan.
 “The Gods and Infernals do not explain their actions, but most believe that if someone had the full potential to tap into all three… he would be stronger than either the Gods or the Greater Daemons.
 He would have the potential to rule all the realms and break the great balance.
 This is something that not even the Infernals want,” he added.

Running towards the pond to do what we do best, destroy monsters.
 Only this time it was different.
 Chapter 2
 We ran and ducked behind a large boulder, huddling together.
 We all sat down, closed our eyes, and concentrated.
 I felt a shiver run through my body as I left it and entered my hunter form.
 I followed Emily, Jason, and Seth as we crept silently over to the monsters, splitting up to surround them.
 I counted two thrashers, which surprised me.
 I swear we saw more before.
 The thrasher turned before we could execute a surprise attack.

 “What do you have that would make me jealous.” “Uh…” he stumbled.
 “I don’t know, that’s what you usually say in this type of situation.” I laughed.
 “Then what happens?” “I don’t know.” Seth whipped out his leg and tripped me.
 I landed with an oof, and got dead grass all over me.
 He chuckled as I gave him a deadly glare.
 “Oh!” He said.
 “You’re jealous because I’m not covered in grass.” “Not yet,” I said, my voice dripping with sarcasm.
 I lunged at him and he rolled to the side.
 I kicked dirt at his face and he spit it out.

I held it up.
 It was a thin, vine that was about a foot long.
 It felt like a ribbon to me and I shrugged.
 I don't usually wear ribbons and bows; that was Emily's style.
 I pulled my hair back and tied the vine.
 It kept my hair out of my face and acted like a rubber band.
 “Thanks Emily,” I said.
 She finished tying her hair back.
 “No problem.
 We should look for somewhere to stay for the night.” I looked around, but everywhere was bare ground, hill after hill.

 I swayed.
 “Maybe you should sit down,” he warned.
 That sounded like a good idea.
 “Half-breed?” I asked, unable to form full sentences.
 “Half fairy, half elf.” He sat in a chair as he started to answer and I kept moving past the bench where I intended to land and crawled onto his lap, curling my feet up, knees to my chest.
 His voice seemed mesmerizing as he continued, “Her mother was a fairy from the West.
 Fiery one, her.” I wrapped my arms around my legs, holding my knees tight, and placed my chin there to rest my head.
 “Tell me more.” It was all I could do to pay attention to his words, but I was fascinated by their sound.
 “Her father was a dark elf.

Meat consumption in China has tripled since 1978 and is expected to more than double again over the next two decades.
 Sugar consumption in developing countries is currently less than half the average of industrial nations.
 In India, sugar consumption is projected to rise from 13 kg to more than 25 kg, generating a demand for a 100 per cent increase in sugar cane production, the establishment of 300 to 400 new sugar mills in the country and the creation of 3 to 4 million new jobs in this industry alone.
 Worldwide, raising the average level of sugar consumption in developing countries could generate tens of millions of additional jobs in agriculture, industry and services.
 Viewing the future demand for food from this perspective reveals a tremendous opportunity.
 Vast sections of humanity now aspire to the higher quantity, wider variety and greater nutritional content of food once consumed only by the wealthy.
 An effort to raise nutritional standards in the developing countries nearer to the levels prevalent among industrial countries will not only eradicate hunger, but also dramatically spur economic growth, employment, and purchasing power among the rural poor, stimulating growth of production and jobs in industry and services, as well as increasing exports and imports.
 Raising the entire world population to the level of the prosperous nations would require a 72 per cent increase in total world food production, measured in terms of calories.
 In order to meet the people’s nutritional requirements for fruit and vegetables, India’s production of these crops needs to double within the next decade.
 Achieving that high level will generate more than six million new jobs in the country.

I missed Davis when I first came here, and I never felt for him like--" "Marie."
 He pulled her into his arms, hugging her tightly.
 "I don't want to cause you pain.
 But I can't help it that I love you.
 And that I want you to stay here with me."
 Her body shook with sobs.
 Rick scooped her up and sat down with her on his lap.
 "Please don't cry, sweetheart," he pleaded, kissing her hair.
 He opened his mouth to tell her that she might not even be able to get back, since she'd been unsuccessful so far.
 But that would just hurt her more.

Chapter 14 For the first time in longer than I could remember, I woke up two minutes before my alarm went off.
 I was showered, dressed, and ready to go ten minutes before normal, but after pulling my books together, I just sat down on the sofa.
 Today was the day.
 I hadn't consciously planned it when I went to bed, but circumstances were perfect.
 If I was wrong, Mom was not only home, judging by the noises filtering down the stairs, she was awake and only a few minutes away from coming downstairs.
 Even filled with the near certainty that Brandon's parents, and by extension him, were our secret benefactors, the next fifteen minutes were some of the longest in my life.
 When Brandon's Mustang finally appeared around the bend in the lane, I found myself smiling so hard my face was starting to hurt.
 Breathing silent but heartfelt thanks that Mom was in the shower and therefore couldn't hear the low rumble of the Mustang's engine, I slipped out the front door and skipped down the concrete steps.
 "I figured you were either too sick to get out of bed, or you finally decided to trust me."
 Brandon's gray eyes twinkled as he made a show of checking me over.

I was fifteen when, on Christmas night, I lost my dad to a heart attack.
 He left my mom and me alone in our house on a hill a few miles north of Mexico and near enough to the Pacific so that when Santa Ana winds blew the gunk away, we could see ocean and islands.
 My mom was a rock.
 Over the past few years, before losing my dad, she had helped bury her father, a sister, and two brothers.
 She was the one who always fed me, nursed me, brought home a monthly check, and covered the debts my dad’s failed business ventures had accumulated.
 But soon after that dreadful Christmas, she got stricken by headaches and became a hermit.
 Evenings she would withdraw to her room and lie with a cool cloth on her forehead, listening to the Lakers, the Padres, or Dodgers, or to whomever the playoffs featured.
 Even through the World Series, she hardly watched an inning on television.
 She preferred the dark and her radio.
 That year, the Yankees won in five games.

Balancing there was a slightly misshapen but undeniable sculpture of a small black horse.
 Chevelle rolled his eyes.
 Still smiling, I looked back to the stone, but it had returned to its uninteresting round shape.
 Chevelle answered my unspoken question.
 “Yes, it’s… tricky.” He smiled a little at using Steed’s word.
 “You can’t change something’s makeup, but you can change the way it appears.
 You can move it, but only if you’re near.
 You can stop someone’s heart, but you can’t make them feel happy about it.” He hesitated after that last part, contemplating, and then continued, “You can manipulate the elements, move water, draw it from the ground, but you cannot easily make it appear from nothing… though one can usually collect moisture from the air.
 Fire is easier.
 It spreads so fast.

I didn't recognize the vehicle, which was a bad sign.
 It was a light-eating black, and emitted the throaty roar of a sports car.
 The windows were tinted; I could see that much out of the corner of my eye without acknowledging that it was there.
 That really seemed like the best course.
 Maybe if I pretended he wasn't there, the driver would just go away.
 A hint of motion told me that wasn't going to be the case.
 The passenger side window was sliding down with the smooth, even motion of power windows.
 "I've heard that some of you easterners have some really funny ideas.
 I guess seeing as how we don't have any mass transit out here you must've decided you needed to walk home.
 Don't you think it's a bit hot for that kind of environmental responsibility?"

The distant impression that it might have been the brush of lips had me drawing in a sharp breath, and I coughed, gasping to fill my lungs.
 The air shifted as those surrounding me moved in response.
 I forced my eyes open and found Ruby, Steed, and Chevelle.
 They looked for a moment as if they were suffering my pain… and then I realized the pain was gone, the siren was silenced.
 My breathing steadied, the fear abating, and their faces relaxed.
 Relief washed their expressions, but their postures remained stiff, alert.
 I pushed up to find the source of the danger and dizziness incapacitated me.
 They rushed to kneel beside me and I could see that was how they had been before my gasp had moved them to standing.
 My throat was too raw to speak, so Chevelle gave me a canteen.
 I would have taken anything, but I was glad it was water, not hot wine or that foul-tasting elixir.

He was further back now, raising his right hand so a stream of fire followed it, arcing in my direction.
 I was afraid I wouldn’t be able to extinguish it before it hit me.
 My feet were frozen in place.
 I could only think of one thing: Fight fire with fire.
 I flung my arm toward the incoming stream of flames and a tongue of fire akin to a dragon’s shot out and collided with it.
 I was shocked.
 I’d only used my power to light candles and lanterns.
 I’d had no idea I could produce such a vicious plume of flames.
 I looked to Chevelle.
 “Yes,” he exalted.

Sylvia blamed her sister Rosarie for the crash.
 Rosarie, she believed, wielded demonic powers.
 In twilight, Eric and I climbed up from the beach and explored some caves.
 After dark, we rested atop the cliff, in a little park a half mile from the Cabrillo lighthouse.
 Eric paced, finally sat down, and asked what I’d been thinking about my dad that day.
 I told him how Christmas was always my dad’s favorite day, how the only plants he ever grew were poinsettias he would deliver to the family graves every Christmas morning after the presents got exchanged and breakfast was over.
 When I finished, Eric paced again.
 Then he squatted in front of the bench where I sat and gazed hard at me, as though wondering how far I could be trusted.
 After deciding in my favor, he said, “There’s a big change coming.
 I don’t know what it will be.

I'm not sure why she's fixated on him the way she has, or why she views Lucy as such a deadly threat to her chances with him, but it's essentially that simple."
 I felt like my head should be reeling from the sheer stupidity.
 Even in a town this small, it didn't seem like the competition for the available males should be a matter for death threats.
 Brandon took my head shaking as denial of what he'd said, rather than disbelief regarding the situation.
 "I promise that every word I just told you is true.
 More importantly, I promise I'll make sure nothing terrible happens to you."
 Looking into Brandon's caring eyes, I almost couldn't believe any of it.
 Being threatened and then having the perfect man come to your rescue didn't happen in real life.
 Then again, maybe I was due for some happy endings.
 With a sigh, I thanked him for the ride, and we parted ways.

When I looked back to them, Steed was watching me, smiling.
 I tossed the burned meat onto the table, considering going back to bed.
 Ruby laughed and it made my hair stand on end.
 No, I’d stay.
 She might be our host now but I’d get my chance.
 I’d fix her.
 She shifted and the markings on her leg caught my attention.
 A thin painted vine trailed up to her thigh.
 She noticed me looking.
 “Well, Frey, I feel like I know so much about you.” She smiled slyly at Chevelle.

“True,” he said, “unless you have a way of smoothing it out.” Rodregas waited for a few seconds as the three approached the main farmhouse building.
 The walls were of thick cut stone and it was built on an impressive scale for a farmhouse, though worn-looking.
 Of course, there were no signs of a roof, doors or windows.
 As they entered the yard, the feeling of the hair standing up on their bodies settled down and instead a feeling of fullness replaced it.
 The horses had been acting up and Rodregas hoped that with the energy smoothing out, the horses would stop fighting their lines.
 Though in truth the horses seemed to be getting more agitated.
 As the magic smoothed out Rodregas smiled and said, “The ley line would be as much of a problem as a help unless, of course, the farmhouse is made of Nymph stone.” Rodregas expected the sound of pleased surprise but instead heard alarmed in-drawn breaths from them both; he saw that they were looking to the right, where he suddenly noticed movement.
 Two female Dire Cats stepped out of the orchard and made their way to the farmhouse.
 They had a relaxed, bored look.
 He thought that they gave him a casual nod, but he could not actually see any movement.

What about our parents?” “He told me, and I quote, ‘Miss did you not think that her majesty would have this all planned out?
 You don’t have to worry.’ I personally think it’s all a little skeptical, don’t you?” “Yes,” she said, digging for a pencil and paper from my bag, “I do.
 We don’t even know who this ‘majesty’ is and if this information is reliable.
 I understand the Half-way part, that makes sense, but the destiny part doesn’t.” I sighed and sat down on the log.
 “The dwarf said to meet him tomorrow morning near ‘the thorn that reaches the sky.’ What does that mean anyway?” Jason stepped over and spoke instead of Emily, who was furiously writing everything down, as if she’d forget in a couple of seconds, “It could be a description of something in town, maybe a building or a landmark.” I suddenly got an idea and took another piece of paper out.
 “Hey Jason maybe you could draw what you think it might be and that would help us.” “I’ll try my best, Jazell,” he said.
 I knew that his drawing would probably help us.
 He was the best artist I knew, his artwork was almost real.
 “Hey guys,” Emily piped up from her paper, “I think we should get home and speak to our parents.
 I want to see what this dwarf was talking about when he said that everything was already arranged.” “I agree.” I grabbed my backpack.

 As the two brothers left, another soul traveled in the dark.
 He made not a sound as he moved.
 Any attempts at tracking his passage would be utterly futile, for not a single blade of grass remained bent when his foot stepped away.
 He was Dieredon, Scoutmaster of the Quellan elves, and few souls could match his silence, speed, or skills with blade and bow.
 When the village came into view of his eagle-like eyes, his gut sank.
 Not a single sign of life decorated the streets or moved in the fields.
 He prayed to Celestia he was wrong, but his heart knew he wasn’t.
 He found nothing to convince him otherwise as he quickly scanned the village.
 He found many homes left wide open, yet none answered him when he called inside.

She accepted.
 Then a girl passed along a rumor that Liz Pence wanted to go out with me.
 Liz was a beauty.
 We dated a few times before the prom, and she would've preferred that I give Karen notice and take her instead.
 But I was neither that cold-blooded nor that stuck on Liz.
 She might be as pretty, but if she possessed any goodness like what I saw in Karen, she hid it deep.
 Prom night, for reasons more complicated than I can remember so long, Cliff was driving a '49 Ford convertible that belonged to Bob Williams, whom I will visit in Portland a few days from now.
 Cliff's date was Chris Latin.
 Karen and I rode in the back seat.
 Karen had a cold.

Marie couldn't wait to feel the airplane move.
 It was hard to believe that it could stay up in the air.
 She'd seen airplanes before, but she'd never been in one.
 She didn't even know anyone who had.
 The plane began rolling forward!
 Squeezing Rick's hand harder, Marie listened carefully as the flight attendant explained what to do in emergencies.
 When she'd finished, Marie pointed to an overhead panel and asked Rick, "Is this where the oxygen masks fall from?"
 "I think so."
 "Haven't you ever put one on?"
 "No.

"She's a complete monster.
 None of the other teachers are nearly as strict as Campbell.
 Making you catch up on all that homework is ridiculous."
 My silence seemed to leave my new friend at a loss for words.
 I guess she was used to people agreeing with everything she said.
 I didn't like to lie though, so when I didn't agree with someone I tended not to say anything.
 I guess I didn't think my new task was as unreasonable as it'd first appeared?
 "On the plus side, at least we'll both be at the math lab together.
 I've had to spend an hour there every evening since Dad found out I had the class low on the first test.

Her ears, upturned at the peak, were tiny even for her race.
 She wore a long green dress bound by a golden sash.
 “Well?
 Who sent you here?” she asked.
 “Was it some mean man trying to toy with you?”
 “I’m sorry,” Harruq said before resuming his slack-jawed staring.
 Aurelia uncrossed her arms, those same soft features turning remarkably fierce as she glared at him.
 “Stop that.
 If you don’t shut your mouth, I’m turning you into a toad.”
 He shut his mouth.

Swallowing, he said hoarsely, "You like touching me, don't you?"
 Her eyes met his briefly and then returned to follow the action of her hands.
 "Yes," she whispered.
 Rick's arms slid around her waist, and he bent his head to kiss her.
 Marie's hands continued to move over his chest as she returned his kiss.
 His lips were warm and strong, and his kiss made her heart flutter.
 She didn't feel the shyness she'd felt when they'd kissed before, and she was disappointed when Rick ended it.
 "Pizza," Rick muttered, gazing down into her dazed face.
 "Hmmm?"
 "Pizza's here."

We were quiet in the closet in my mother’s room.
 The landlord would walk through the house yelling my mother’s first name, Karla .

 We could hear him approaching the bedroom as the volume of his voice increased.
 We watched through the slats in the closet door as he would open her dresser drawers and rummage through her belongings, including her undergarments, while looking around over his shoulder, still yelling her name.

Hopefully there I could safely find a niche among the other quasi-loners who didn't fit in anywhere else.
 As I turned my light out and got into bed I realized there'd been one bright spot to the day.
 Brandon Worthingfield III might not really be interested in me, but he was obviously at the top of the social food chain, and he'd already shown me way more attention than any of the boys back home ever had.
 Maybe there was some hope after all.
 ** I was lost, not just in the sense of not knowing where I was, but because I'd never been anywhere even remotely like this.
 The breeze was louder than any I'd ever heard before, and was laden with an unimaginable host of scents.
 It took me several seconds to sort through things enough to realize I was smelling things I didn't even have a name for.
 After several seconds of trying to catalog the most delightful of my new discoveries, I realized I'd had my eyes closed since I'd gotten here, possibly an unconscious defense mechanism meant to protect me from sensory overload.
 The distant sound of water trickling down a rock face, of leaves gently caressing each other in the breeze faded away as I took in an amazing wonderland of light.
 The trees I'd been listening to were exactly where I expected them to be, but it took me several heartbeats to recognize them.

Still, if any bus trip is going to be fun, it'd be this one."
 Rachel handed me my last book, and waved to Isaac, who was just now getting up from his table.
 "Hello, Adriana.
 I assume you'll need a ride home today?"
 It was the first time Isaac had actually spoken to me, and I was surprised at how well-spoken he was.
 His voice sounded like a superbly-tuned cello.
 I filed the information away as further evidence he wasn't really our age.
 "Yes please, Brandon can only take me home on Tuesdays and Thursdays."
 It wasn't my imagination; Isaac flinched slightly, and Rachel's smile momentarily turned plastic.
 I mentally kicked myself for having once again stepped squarely between the Capulets and Montagues.

Ripping the other arrow out of his side, he felt a warm, soothing sensation fill his body.
 “Are you alright?” he heard a raspy voice ask from atop the stairs.
 “Yeah, I’m fine.
 Just had to take care of something here.”
 He trudged down the stairs to where Qurrah waited.
 “How many did you kill?” the necromancer asked.
 “Just two,” he replied.
 His skeptical brother raised an eyebrow.
 “That is a lot of blood for just two.”
 Harruq ignored him.

I don’t want any problems, and I don’t want to see any weapons.
 Drug dealing has never been an honorable profession, so anything could happen.
 Though I have never met the buyer, I have been assured by his girlfriend that he will have the money and the deal will take only a few minutes.
 I also know that Ashley is seriously addicted to Oxy.
 After we first met—at her apartment—she called me several times just to get a few pills to hold her over until we could meet for this drug deal.
 I have refused her every time as I have told her that we will meet just the one time and exchange all the drugs for the money at once.
 She has tried to entice me with her young body in exchange for a couple Oxy, but I have resisted the temptation.
 The first time Ashley and I met I had the pleasure of seeing her naked body, but my goal is not to see it again, my goal is to do this drug deal.
 Her actions highlight that she is seriously addicted and that is not comforting when I am taking her word that Steve is a trustworthy drug dealer, as if there is such a thing.
 Another car approaches and it is white, but I cannot tell the make of the vehicle.

The man in black shook his head.
 His expression showed there would be no further argument.
 “If you had been mine at the age of nine…‌ my previous apprentice Xelrak held but a shred of your strength.”
 Qurrah straightened at the name.
 “I have heard of Xelrak.
 He toppled the Citadel.”
 Velixar smiled as he remembered a cherished memory.
 “Indeed.
 It was his finest hour, and a significant victory for Karak.
 The paladins of Ashhur are all but crushed.”

I mumbled something I hoped sounded intelligible and headed towards the bathroom.
 I passed Mr. Simms and another teacher on my way out, but apparently I looked as awful as I felt.
 They just shot me stern looks rather than stopping me to ask what had happened.
 It wasn't until I'd finished dry-heaving and was trying to clean myself back up, that I wondered where they'd been.
 The school building wasn't that big.
 If they'd really been trying to break up the fight, they should have arrived minutes earlier.
 I thought about hiding in the bathroom for a while, but that was exactly the kind of place a girl like Cassie would want to catch me.
 Instead I took a deep breath and walked outside.
 Britney was waiting for me.
 By her expression she'd decided on being mad.

I forced myself out of bed regardless.
 Mom wouldn't be in to wake me up; she might not even be home.
 It still wasn't light by the time I finished showering.
 The fact that my body was, at least partly, still on Minnesota time should have helped, but the morning was just as unbearable as normal.
 Fighting back a yawn, I flipped on my bedroom light and examined the half-dozen boxes that might contain my clothes.
 I debated searching through them all, but it would just mean another fight if I did find them.
 With a sigh of resignation I walked over to the chair where I'd left my selections from the night before, and pulled the faded jeans up my frail-looking legs.
 I finished up with a tank top, covered by a light blue blouse.
 All Cindi's stuff.
 Thoughts of her were just as dangerous as they'd been last night, but maybe I was getting a little better.

Alec always does what's right though.
 No matter what it costs him personally."
 Dom's words were timely.
 Before hearing them I would've watched Alec's near-stillness with unconcern, but now, seeing the way Jasmin and Isaac split their attention between Alec and the wolves they'd just pulled off of him, I could nearly see the effort he was exerting to shove aside the instincts demanding the death of the wolves who'd marked him, who'd questioned his supremacy.
 With a shudder, he relaxed again, and Jessica approached, dropping to her stomach to crawl the last little ways, and then rolling onto her back.
 James dropped down on all fours, grounding the wicked-looking claws tipping his hands, and then it seemed all was forgiven.
 My suspicions were confirmed when Dom sighed with relief.
 It hadn't just been my imagination.
 Alec's will had been sufficient to the task, but its victory hadn't been assured.
 It was a terrible risk to run, one that apparently put a big fat target on his chest for anyone in the pack who wasn't happy with how things were currently running, but Alec ran it regardless.

"It was my fault so I'll be your ride back and forth from school every day."
 "I don't know about all of that, but thanks for the lift just now."
 I fumbled for a minute with the unfamiliar latch, and then invited the blistering heat into the cool interior of the car as I swung the door open.
 Brandon gently captured my arm before I could slide out of the passenger seat.
 "You'll wait for me tomorrow?"
 "I don't know--maybe.
 Anyone that thinks Minnesota is the east instead of the Midwest can't really be relied upon to remember important things like appointments."
 I could feel myself blushing again as I pulled free and fled into the house with a single wave goodbye.
 Normally I wasn't flirtatious.
 Heck, I hardly knew the meaning of the word, but something about Brandon turned it all into a harmless game.

The smile was still there.
 That had to be a good sign.
 Usually when people said something nice and didn't mean it their smiles only lasted as long as they were speaking.
 I tried a tentative smile in return and his widened slightly.
 "I'm Brandon."
 Feeling more than a little nervous, I allowed him to capture my right hand in his.
 "I'm Adr...Adriana."
 Our handshake had ended, but my hand was tingling slightly.
 It was a pleasant, if illusionary, reminder of the contact, one I was hoping would last for about the next three days.
 "You must be the poor soul who's got everyone buzzing with curiosity."

You need to remember to compose poems to their great beauty.
 That usually helps at least as much as flowers.
 Jim – What if she isn’t beautiful enough to deserve a poem.
 Art – Write a haiku then.
 Or a limerick, just make sure it isn’t dirty.
 It doesn’t matter, as long as you take time to make it sound good.
 Jim – But what if she isn’t pretty.
 What if the angry woman in question has a face like a horse?
 Art – Then write a fiction novel about her great beauty.
 The entire purpose of the whole deed isn’t accuracy, but flattery to keep you out of the dog house.

That wasn't the kind of person who'd take advantage of my human weakness to seduce me.
 In fact, it was all too likely he was going to fight my every effort to bring us closer together precisely because he didn't want to take advantage of me.
 I was suddenly very certain though that I was going to wage that war.
 I couldn't not want him, not love him, any more than he could do less than his best to keep his family from harm.
 Chapter 28 Alec was completely drenched in sweat, and I still wanted to throw myself at him so badly my teeth hurt.
 It shouldn't be possible for someone to look so good dressed in what amounted to little more than loose, extra-stretchy sweatpants.
 "How was training?"
 It was hard to sound casual.
 The urge to kiss him had become almost overpowering in the last few days.
 He knew me better on every level imaginable than anyone outside my immediate family ever had, and all I could think about right now was how much I wanted to touch him.

Rodregas’ new body was very gifted, but it was still mortal and some things he would just not be able to do as well as others.
 In some ways this was reassuring, a connection to his past.
 “Can I ask you a question?” she asked.
 Rodregas smiled and said, “of course, what?” “Have you thought of trying to become a sigil warrior?
 You are a very powerful magician now.
 You could probably take one or even two of the greater sigils and still have more power than you had before, and as a warrior the enhancement from the sigil would make you an even more powerful fighter.” Rodregas nodded, “I have thought about it.
 In fact, I am sure given the opportunity that I would take on one of the greater or several of the lesser sigils.
 I am a warrior first, not a mage.
 Of course, leaving a little magic left over would be great if I can, but you never really know until after the searing.” Rodregas paused and then added, “The problem is that only two groups in the Eastern Realms have the knowledge to do the searing.
 The first, of course, is the Guild of the Celestial Path.

 That’s the reason why he didn’t come to my pool party.
 Cleo – And you believed him darling?
 Maybe he was just making excuses.
 Liz – Please, he’s my best friend.
 I know he wouldn’t lie to me about that.
 Cleo – Men lie all the time.
 Liz – So do you.
 You seem to have to flirt with all my boyfriends.
 I’ve even seen you chase the gardener and just about every other man you come across.

Everything had bigger wheels, and suspension that lifted it up several inches.
 Vincent's truck had more in common with the beasts in monster truck rallies than it did with the souped-up vehicles I'd seen driving around town.
 The tires were the biggest I'd seen on anything outside of a tractor, and the lift kit on it was so outrageously tall that I was pretty sure someone was going to have to lift me into the cab.
 By myself it was going to take a rope and climbing shoes.
 Of course it was black.
 I couldn't imagine Vincent in anything other than a black vehicle.
 Predictably, Vincent was rubbing down his vehicle, but the exercise seemed more targeted to giving him a chance to walk around with his shirt off than it did with cleaning up the already immaculate truck.
 Based on the way the cheerleader types by the garage were watching him, it was working.
 I much preferred Brandon's jeans and tee shirt, tight as it was, over the shorts and shirtless look, but apparently I was in the minority.
 I almost hyperventilated when Vincent casually walked out of the house with a pair of beer kegs and tied them down in the bed of his pickup.

Even here it is likely to come primarily from entrenched vested interests, not the general public.
 A mere tinkering with or modest amendment to the structure of the UN will only perpetuate the inherent inadequacies of the present system and postpone its maturation into a truly effective instrument for global political, economic and social integration and collective accomplishment.
 Many proposals are being floated to modify its workings, mostly by expanding representation on the Security Council.
 As an interim measure and first steps, the immediate addition of five more permanent members to the Security Council, based on the criteria of population and economic status, and the abolition of the veto power are fully justified.
 However, these changes do not go far enough in furthering the interests of global peace and development.
 They will not fundamentally alter the out-dated, non-representative structure which perpetuates the status quo.
 It is time to devise a new formula and a new structure for international governance that will reconcile and harmonize the political rights and economic interests of all the world’s peoples.
 The institution that had come to symbolize the Cold War must be restructured in such a manner as to symbolize the abolition of all war and the establishment of peace and democracy as the foundations for global development.
 Global Social Revolution
 A second revolution also possesses tremendous transforming power to accelerate human progress – the revolution of rising expectations.

Didn't contribute indeed.
 As if Nora's favorite student would just sit around while there were equations to solve."
 I felt like I'd been hit in the stomach.
 I hadn't realized just how fond of me Mrs. Campbell was.
 My mind whirling with too many thoughts to sort out, I turned to go back to my desk, only to find Alec staring at me.
 He still didn't seem happy to be sharing the same room with me, but the complete disgust from half an hour before had been replaced with something more measuring.
 In Spanish, Mrs. Tiggs took special delight in telling us that she'd started grading our tests and a couple of them weren't looking very good.
 I suffered through the last hour of school and then hurried to my locker.
 I didn't really want to meet up with Britney, but I also didn't want to alienate her any more than I already had.
 I shouldn't have even bothered.

When they sat down, Rick told her, "I want to start with fried rice."
 She laughed.
 "You were serious about being fed!"
 "You'd better believe it."
 She fed him a forkful of fried rice.
 He returned the favor, and within ten minutes the table was covered with grains of rice and bits of food they'd spilled.
 "Let me have some of that sweet and sour chicken," Rick said.
 He shook his head when she speared a piece.
 "No.
 With your fingers."

 He’s the antichrist.
 He broke up Black Lung, not Lorelei, not me.
 The minute that raincloud in a suit walked into our studio—our fucking studio, where we made magic, man, where it all happened—the minute he walked in, in his appropriate sharkskin suit, we were fucked.
 Crafty brought him in, of course.
 He was Kim’s father, as you know.
 Crafty’s fiancé, since wife, since ex-wife.
 Kim was alright—you know, she had that mane of golden-white hair, she was beautiful, goddamn beautiful.
 We all wanted her.
 That’s ok to say, Lor?

It was in the school cafeteria—Jesus, those gigs, you gotta love ‘em, right?
 I mean, looking back, you gotta love that shit.
 Girls and boys rubbing against each other, hormones exploding all over the room, while we grind away at some awful cover song like “One is the Loneliest Number.”  Occasionally slipping in one of our originals which is met with a silence like we farted in church.
 (laughs)  It was a kick.
 I mean, these couples using the opportunity to practically hump on the dance floor, hands all over asses, the chaperons looking bored over in the corner, old Ricky Glass, the mechanical drawing teacher, toking up.
 What a time that was.
 Anyway, Carol was suddenly there.
 When I stepped off the stage between gigs there was Debbie with this blond young woman I’d never even noticed in the halls of Central High, so tuned out I was, so really out of the swim as far as high school was concerned.
 I mean, if I’d been paying attention I would never have missed Carol Warner.
 We even had a class together.

She claimed that she could keep going, but she fell asleep on the way home.
 They were too tired to do anything but watch TV that evening.
 They went to bed early, but still, she didn't wake up until almost 9:00 the next morning.
 There was no use walking in the garden this morning, she decided with a yawn.
 She listened carefully but didn't hear Rick's shower or any noise in the kitchen.
 It was past his usual breakfast time, so he'd be starved when he got up.
 She could have breakfast ready for him, maybe even serve it to him in bed.
 Jumping up, she pulled on a pair of shorts and a t-shirt and ran downstairs.
 She didn't know how to make very much, but she could scramble some eggs, prepare bacon in the microwave, and make some toast.
 It didn't even take very long.

He was speaking with Virden when he turned his head slowly toward me… and I was staring into his eyes again.
 Oh, give me a break; he’s halfway across the village from you.
 But I was staring.
 Despite my resolve, color rose to my cheeks once more as I turned away.
 I couldn’t understand why he was affecting me this way.
 The pages stuffed in my shirt felt like fire against my skin.
 I quickened my pace, caught my toe on a root, and stumbled.
 As soon as I righted myself, I wasn’t able to stop myself from peeking back to see if he had noticed, but he was gone.
 I didn’t know if I was relieved.
 My mind went over the encounter again as I made my way home.

But I'd still like you to have some dessert."
 He reached into his breast pocket.
 "Maybe a bite of yours."

 So this was the night!
 Wanting to prolong the moment as long as possible, she asked him, "What is it?"
 "Open it and see."

I think she walked over to me and simply whispered, fuck me.
 I think it was that straightforward.
 There was no bullshit about Lor—there still isn’t.
 We ended up on her bed, which is a story in itself.
 Sixteenth century bed, bedclothes like in a harem…I felt like I was returning to the womb—the bed was that enveloping, that warm.
 Oh, man.
 I don’t know if I can tell this.
 When we were naked—she was like some preternatural creature, her body’s every curve fit me like a new skin.
 When she pressed her breasts against me I was gone, man.
 And I had this erection, it was beyond human somehow, hard as anthracite—you could hang your coat on it (laughs) and she worked her hand around me like a necromancer casting a spell.

Everyone who swaps classes is going to be doing double homework for the duration.
 Assignments for their old class, which they presumably still want to get credit for, and assignments for the new class so as not to make any more waves than necessary with their temporary teacher.
 It only makes sense to place that burden on the ones who can most easily deal with it."
 That last part had been said in a near whisper, due to the fact that we were right outside Mrs. Sorenson's class.
 Everything he was saying made sense, but didn't resolve the real reason I was so worried.
 "I can help.
 I could switch at least one class and still keep up."
 Alec shook his head.
 "Adriana, you're struggling in two classes already.
 How do you propose to handle yet another set of homework?"

Her mind was a net, and she cast it further and further out, scanning the rolling hills and the plains beyond.
 “Found him,” she whispered.

 [section break](break.png)
 A blue portal ripped through the air before Qurrah, beckoning him.
 He looked through but saw only mists and distorted landscape.
 Seeing nothing to lose, he got to his feet and stepped inside.
 He felt the sensation of traveling a great distance yet his mind insisted he had taken only a single step.
 He could see the orange glow of the great pyre several miles away.
 “Brother!” Harruq cried, wrapping him in a hug.

It was he who prepared your breakfast.
 A small act of atonement, but still a start nonetheless."
 It was all so surprising that it took me a moment to find my voice.
 "Thank you, Donovan.
 Have I slept in too long?"
 A gentle smile met my inquiry.
 "Those of us who don't require normal amounts of sleep have all been up for quite some time, with the exception of Master Alec, who remained abed for an uncharacteristic length of time, but the rest of the house is just now waking.
 In fact I rather suspect you have just enough time to shower and eat before Mistress Rachel will be pounding on the door, as it were, in excitement for your upcoming trip into town."
 A groan escaped me despite my best efforts.
 Donovan was too polite to ask outright, but I had to respond to his raised eyebrow or he might think I didn't want to talk to Rachel.

Steed was watching me, smiling appreciatively, and I realized I was wearing a huge grin.
 And about three pounds of mud.
 The slower pace gave me time to take everything in.
 The ground had leveled off again, clearing to open meadows of low grass and a few scattered trees.
 Large gray rocks dotted the landscape.
 There was a haziness on the horizon but as we rode it began to clear, revealing a mammoth lake ahead.
 It was a hundred times bigger than the tiny forest ponds I was used to, as smooth as glass.
 Behind it the haze thinned just enough I could see the outline of mountains.
 The image was like a punch in the chest.
 Chevelle rode up beside us.

When we believe in, fully trust certain people, if we have any sense, we will follow their example and not only take what advice they offer but actively seek every piece of wisdom we can wrest out of them.
 If I want to become a baseball star, I should look for a coach or mentor whose character and lessons I can believe in.
 If I believe in Mother Teresa, I should read about her and talk to those who knew her and attend to whatever I learn.
 To the extent that we follow Christ’s example, give of our selves, our time and resources to help people in need, allow time away from the crowds to contemplate and pray, put aside our self concerns and turn to concern for others, our minds and hearts get invaded and possessed by the Holy Spirit.
 And in that condition, the world transforms before our eyes.
 For passing out food, clothing or loving concern we always get blessed, and while we live with a blessed attitude, the most bedraggled people may appear possessed of astonishing beauty, as God must see them.
 When we follow the example of Jesus, through his blessing we begin to perceive the glorious reality of all creation.
 In other words, we enter heaven in all its beauty.
 Beauty

That was a fail, I scolded myself.
 A FAIL!
 “Nice try,” Seth whispered and I think he really meant it.
 Or maybe he was teasing me.
 It’s hard to tell in these situations.
 Seth brandished his sword.
 “My turn.” “Really, warrior?” Kojas said and laughed.
 His laugh was like a bunch of spiders running down my back.
 “You think your sword will do any more than the pathetic archer girl’s arrow?” “Hey,” I shouted, “I’m not a pathetic archer girl!” Oh course, the two ignored me.
 I swear the air sizzled with the tension between Kojas and Seth.

Thank you for respecting the hard work of this author.
 Dedication I dedicate this book to my wife Lisa, the one person who has been with me through more ups and downs than anyone could ever imagine.
 You never know when or if the perfect person will appear.
 The fateful night I set eyes on her set in motion everything that would happen to me for the rest of my life.
 I couldn’t be happier that I was fortunate enough to be in the right place at the perfect time to meet my soul mate.
 She is the most beautiful person, both inside and out.
 She has been an inspiration for me and making her happy is the goal of my life.
 We are best friends, confidants, partners, and true lovers and together we are one.
 I can’t imagine my existence without her, and I know that everything I am and all I will become is shaped by her genuine kindness.
 Meeting Lisa is the most important defining moment in my life.

Sharper in my mind now maybe than even when they happened."
 Her hand gripped mine with a fragile strength that hinted at the vibrant, powerful woman she'd been back then.
 Back before the years had worn at her.
 "The pack was huge back then.
 Much larger even than Brandon's is today, but all of that might didn't save Alec's father that night.
 There was a nightmare of blood and death, and when the sun finally touched the earth again the next morning, a full third of our number were dead, and most of those who remained were crippled.
 I would've been one of the former, except for Donovan."
 The questions continued to bubble up inside me, but I throttled them down, suppressing them rather than risking an interruption which might cause her to not finish.
 "At great risk to himself he carried me away from the site of the battle, running and swimming more miles than I care to think about.
 Eventually his strength finally gave way, and when he couldn't even crawl anymore, he found a cave and did his best to ensure I wouldn't die from exposure.

Under relatively stable and static conditions, these economics principles can be employed to predict changes in economic variables to a considerable extent.
 But under circumstances in which underlying economic, social and political conditions are undergoing radical change, the relevance and predictive capacity of purely economic concepts is quite limited.
 This was the situation confronting the states of the region at the beginning of the transition period, and the reason why the actual results of the reform differed so drastically from what had been anticipated.
 The situation in Eastern and Central Europe was further complicated by the disproportionately large size and importance of the defence sector in the economy.
 This necessitates, not only a change from one economic system to another, but also a restructuring of the entire economy from a defence orientation to a consumer orientation.
 This change in structure could not be brought about by reliance on macro-economic policy.
 2.Political and social consensus is essential for rapid social change: In a democratic society, the market cannot be instituted by decrees or authoritarian methods which belong to the old sys tem.
 In the new political climate, reforms will be successful only in the measure that they are understood and accepted by the population.
 The vitality of the market depends on releasing the initiative of people to act in their own perceived best interests by producing and distributing goods and services for consumption by others.
 This initiative cannot be ordered, it can only be encouraged.

We turned to face the monsters heading for us.
 Seth charged ahead, slicing Thrashers and Frost Beasts.
 I notched an arrow and released it.
 It soared into a swamp toll's head, making it shout out in agony.
 Seth spun around and plunged his sword into the troll's side.
 It gave a screech and fell to the floor, dead.
 Emily raised her hands and vines shot from the ground and wrapped around a troll that had tried to crush Seth.
 I aimed an arrow at its chest and the troll fell to the ground next to the others.
 The last beast fell, dead from Jason's knife, and we all took in a deep breath.
 Seth sheathed his sword and I slung my bow back on my back.

Seth was leaning on the wall, twirling his sword in the dirt, not appearing to notice that I was awake.
 Emily and Jason were sitting in the center of the cave, playing some kind of hand game.
 Jason hit Emily in the arm and she started yelling at.
 So, this is typical thing to wake up to.
 I stood up and walked over to Seth.
 He looked up from the ground and saw my troubled face.
 “What's wrong, Jazell?” “I need to speak to you,” I said in a low voice, “alone.” Seth nodded in understanding and I followed him out of the cave.
 We stood off to the side near the edge of the cliff where Emily and Jason couldn't see us.
 For a minute, I didn't say anything because I didn't know what to say.
 I hesitated, but knew that if I told anyone about the dream, it would be Seth.

Integration and tolerance of diversity are crucial values for the further development of the human community.
 Yet the increasing speed of globalization has accentuated a contrary tendency toward increasing fragmentation.
 The pull of fragmentation cannot be countered solely at the political level.
 Education – both formal and public – is the best means for rapidly communicating and imparting the benefits of integration to the largest numbers of people.
 In order fully to harness cultural potentials for development, we need to understand better the natural process of value formation in society, to discover the circumstances and conditions under which new values are accepted, and the factors that retard or facilitate this process.
 In other words, we need to evolve a theory of value formation which will ultimately enable us to consciously identify and instil values that are most conducive and supportive of a peaceful, prosperous life for all humanity.
 The collective progress of humankind will achieve its maximum velocity when we have discovered how to consciously accelerate the process of values acquisition.
 The role of the UNESCO Commission on Culture and Development can make a valuable contribution to our understanding of this most important issue.
 Strategies for Developing Human Resourcefulness
 The following strategies can be carried out by both govern mental and non-governmental agencies at the national and international level to achieve the goals set forth in this report:

"Ah, and the first question you want to know is how come you didn't realize I was a shape shifter, isn't it?"
 I nodded, surprised at her insight, but more or less resigned to the fact that I was never going to have any kind of secret ever again.
 "Partly it's because I'm so old, but it also has a little bit to do with the fact that I've spent the last couple of decades concealing my presence from others.
 I suppose it has become a habit to hide the more unusual aspects of my nature.
 I guess all that practice has made me better at it than most of the shape shifters you've run into so far."
 It made sense, but didn't really help me fill in any of the broad holes that had been bothering me for so long.
 Mallory gave me several seconds to ponder her answer before continuing.
 "How is the rest of the pack?
 Alec will tell me, but he'll filter his answer through what he thinks I'm able to hear, not necessarily what I need to hear."
 "They're worried.

The group, the guys that did “Desdemona,” man, you heard that?
 Great song.
 CM: 	Yeah, I know that song.
 BG: 	Ok.
 CM: 	Rock and roll?
 BG:  	It’s labels, man.
 That’s the trouble I have.
 What is rock and roll?
 Can you describe it for me?

Tony said, “Oh.
 Good.” A week later, he was leading a Bible study at our house.
 Cliff’s not much of a talker.
 I believe nobody heard his stories from Vietnam until years afterward.
 I don’t pry, so I can’t be sure what goes on inside him, but I have no reason to think he believes in God, or that he doesn’t.
 But whether he believes or not, Cliff has gotten well blessed since our evening with Billy Graham.
 He has four wonderful kids, and Toni, who is one of those rarest of people who appear to grow brighter, stronger, and more beautiful every year.
 Cliff and Billy's dad, Cliff Senior, invited me to dinner not many years ago.
 The evening became an in vino veritas experience.
 After some cups, he said, “Ken, you should know it was me that hounded my son into serving in Vietnam.” I held back from saying, Yeah, I know.

He collapsed to one knee, his hands latched around his sword.
 He tried to raise the blade, but all the strength had left his hands.
 He had lost too much blood.
 When Harruq came charging forward, Condemnation red and hungry, all he could do was dodge.
 Condemnation shattered what remained of the table.
 The elf rolled, his arms tucked against his chest.
 When he pulled out of the roll, he dashed for a large dresser.
 Inside was a stash of healing potions.
 All he needed was one and he could fight again.
 Just one.

“Nothing, we're alone.
 Maybe we can try to get somewhere without bad guys jumping out at us.” “We should move, before something does find us.
 Whatever knocked us out of the sky isn't going to be friendly if they find us again,” I pointed out.
 “Let's move boys, we have a lot more walking to do.” Jason groaned.
 “Why can't they have cars in Igneeria?
 Or maybe a motorcycle, I'm even fine with a golf cart.” “Because,” I said and walked past him, not looking back, “Igneerians aren't lazy Jason's.” I heard him huff and Emily ran up beside me.
 “Good thinking,” she said.
 “The girls should take control.” I shrugged.
 “I guess if that's what you want to do.” Thankfully, there were no trees anywhere except one.
 The ground was mostly dirt and rock, easier to walk on.

"Oh, Rick, thank you so much!
 I'm going to go pack."
 She turned to go upstairs.
 "Whoa."
 He caught her hand, chuckling.
 "It's three days before we leave.
 I think you can sit down and eat first."
 But she was too excited to eat.
 "Will we get to meet any stars?"
 "I don't know.

Employment in the East Asian economies is projected to grow by 37 per cent between 1990 and 2000, while the labour force will increase by only 17 per cent, leading to an increasing shortage of labour in the region.
 In contrast, employment growth is projected to lag behind labour force growth in South Asia, Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa.
 Although job growth has once again started in many OECD countries, economic growth alone will not be sufficient to bring down unemployment rates significantly, especially among youth and the long-term unemployed.
 Changes in values, attitudes, structures and policies will be necessary.
 Unless concerted action steps are taken, global unemployment will increase by 130 million during the 1990s.
 Our thesis is that there is a great deal that can be done to prevent this outcome and even reverse the trend, leading to sharply reduced levels of unemployment and progressive eradication of poverty over the next decade.
 How can we make such an optimistic prognosis in the face of the rising number of unemployed and rising concern of governments everywhere?
 Before presenting our case, it is necessary to challenge several basic concepts about job creation and unemployment.
 Destroying Myths about Job Destruction
 Two common, but pervasive, myths have gained ground that add an aura of scientific determinism to the fatalism regarding rising un employment: the first relates to technology, the second to trade.

Jim  - This all actually happened, and you were out of it, you forgot to pay the bills for three months, and if you recall you wouldn’t take the time to eat unless either Gene, Liz or I brought you something and nagged till you finished it.
 Art – Ah yes, food the fuel for life.
 It doesn’t seem all that important to eat when your world is falling apart.
 How long did it take for Gene to finally snap?
 Jim  - He started spending a lot of time hanging out at their church doing bible lessons.
 He actually applied himself to it, and was pretty good at debating the bible and other religious topics in just a couple of months.
 Gene turned Conservative Christian, it was kind of scary for several months.
 After about three or four months of taking bible lessons they decided to baptize him.
 Art – Three months without offending the entire group and getting him-self kicked out?
 I am indeed impressed by Gene’s willpower, I didn’t know he even possessed that much.

The old man put a hand on the young farmer’s shoulder.
 “Fear not,” he said, a weak smile on his face.
 “Ashhur’s golden eternity awaits us.”
 Jeremiah raised his sword so that the flame of his torch flickered across it.
 “Not this night, not if I can help it,” he said before running toward the battle cry.
 The town held only ninety members, half of them younger than eighteen.
 When the second brutal cry rolled over the houses, most were running west, dragging children and carrying young ones in their arms.
 The men, young and old, took up torches, shortswords, even rakes and sickles, and prepared to defend their homes.
 Bravely they fought, and bravely they died.
 “Run, run, run!” Jeremiah shouted to a mother pulling along a young boy.

The four slavers had mismatched armor; two had short swords and there was one each with an axe and a mace.
 The men circled them, but did not seem eager to move in.
 During the pause Doi’van spoke in a low growl, “All this, and can you believe there is not a decent sized Immortal Guard in the lot.
 When we finish with them I will never fit in that armor.” Rodregas smiled at the disgust in the Hellborn’s tone and the confidence that it implied.
 “True,” Rodregas replied, “but it is pretty.
 And I would love to be facing them with one of those blue steel swords.” “Now don’t go lowering your standards, blue steel and night bronze?
 Good enough for the common soldier, but I fancy something a little more distinctive.” Rodregas was about to ask him what he had in mind when they found out why they had been waiting; two more slavers came up with drawn bows.
 They were going to take them from a safe distance.
 Doi’van and he needed no words; they both knew only instant action gave them a chance.
 Rodregas would like to have tried to take on one of the Immortal Guards, but he had already noticed that the slaver with the mace was a little too close and a little too far away from his nearest companion.

 "Come inside and see the things in my house."
 She shrank back, fearful again.
 "No."
 "It's the only way you'll believe me.

Over thirty minutes of silence passes and Officer White pulls up and I ready myself because I now have a million questions.
 As he gets out of his car, I begin to blurt out my questions and he tells me he must disconnect the wire before we can talk.
 I reach for my waist and pull the wire off before he can help me.
 I hold it out to him, he takes it from me and turns it off, and he says, “We got them.” I am so relieved but that is only one answer to one question and I have many.
 The deal was done and I was so relieved that it was over.
 I then called my wife who was so wound up from the lack of communication over such a long period of time.
 She sobbed uncontrollably as I told her I was unharmed, headed home, the ordeal was over and we busted the drug dealers.
 A hero’s welcome awaited me, as my son was so thankful for what I had done for him.
 As I went to bed that night, my mind would not shut off and the events of that evening replayed in my head over and over again.
 I lay awake for hours wondering what would have happened if the dealer hadn’t run into the cops.

As I shook my head at the idea, my eyes fell downward.
 A small scream escaped.
 My arms were covered in tree bark, blending seamlessly with the stump on which I sat.
 I bolted upright, batting at them as if my shirt were on fire.
 Chevelle and the cloaked woman ran toward me and I looked up in panic.
 When my eyes fell again to my arms, they were normal.
 Had I imagined it?
 Was I losing my mind?
 My head came up once more, and the woman gasped.
 It was Junnie.

Rather, it’s a beginning.

 No doubt some readers will agree with my friend Don Merritt and wonder why I’m allowed on the loose.
 I had a blog called Writing and the Spirit which I suspect Don read so that, at the least mention of any Christian thought or word, he could express his horror.
 In response to a post about Michelangelo having devoted his last years motivated by the idea that his work could assure his salvation, Don wrote: “I still cannot believe that the Ken I knew in the old days can use these phrases [win his salvation, eternal life, the principles Jesus taught] with a straight face, that you really believe these odd, old, irrational superstitions.
 Maybe you have already gone over the edge.” He could be right.
 Even believers might think I am crazy, or worse.
 I have often wondered if imagining Eric or Olga as my companion, confessing my sins and other secrets to them, is not only neurotic, but possibly blasphemous.
 All I can give for an answer is: when Pam was in seminary, one evening she lamented, “Every time I come up with a good idea about some Biblical thing, a professor says ‘Oh yes, that was the so and so fallacy, which was ruled heretical by this or that council in .

Doi’van weighed too much to ride in the overburdened wagon or to ride the horse, so he jogged next to the wagon.
 He had impressive endurance.
 Right before dark Rodregas was watching carefully and found the faint signs of the rocky trail that he remembered.
 He turned the cart onto it, and after going down the path a bit he came across a good place to camp for the night.
 As Doi’van and Rodregas set up camp, Imeralda went back, doing her best to erase their tracks.
 After dinner they all took turns sleeping and keeping watch.
 Rodregas took the first watch and several times he thought he saw something.
 It was not the men they had left behind, but some animal that never came close.
 It seemed to be hanging on the edge of the camp.
 “A wolf maybe?” Rodregas thought.

 CM:  	Yeah.
 BG:  	That’s new.
 You know, Lor studied with this old artist in New York, this Brazilian named Oyvind Fahlstrőm.
 Really, that was his name.
 I think he’s still alive.
 Lor, have you heard from him, from Oy?
 She took a lot from him.
 Though I think she’s gone off in her own direction.
 There’s a cartoonist’s simplicity there, those lines, that is both childlike and very sophisticated.
