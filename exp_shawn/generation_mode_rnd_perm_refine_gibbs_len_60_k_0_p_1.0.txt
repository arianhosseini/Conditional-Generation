When we are around someone we adore, our defenses cave in, because the only thing we fear, the only thing that needs defending, is the communion with the one we adore.
 If we adore God and live in His presence, we are in constant communion with the eternal, way beyond death.
 So, what‚Äôs left to fear.
 The enemy is truly us, in particular the defenses we have established between us and God.
 Vanquish our defensive selves, we are set free.
 One of the songs on my I-pod, "I Surrender All," has long been a favorite.
 I listen, I sing along, I pray the lyrics, I perform the song accompanied by my guitar.
 But somehow all that surrender doesn't quite work.
 Maybe I'll start praying the words of a poem by Olga Savitsky, a friend who adored God.
 She said so often, and she was honest above all, and she lived as much like Brother Lawrence as anybody I know, or know of, maybe excepting some of Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity.

Marie couldn't wait to feel the airplane move.
 It was hard to believe that it could stay up in the air.
 She'd seen airplanes before, but she'd never been in one.
 She didn't even know anyone who had.
 The plane began rolling forward!
 Squeezing Rick's hand harder, Marie listened carefully as the flight attendant explained what to do in emergencies.
 When she'd finished, Marie pointed to an overhead panel and asked Rick, "Is this where the oxygen masks fall from?"

Dom's black outfit had perfectly matched her fur, and whatever it was, it had shrunk down to fit her four-legged form, while still having enough elasticity to expand out to cover her person shape.
 The girl's clothes had an elastic band of some kind at their necks, legs and arms, while the boys were wearing a pants-like number which cinched down over their waist, as well as just above the knees.
 My preoccupation over what everyone was wearing gave Dom a chance to cover the distance between us.
 Donovan smiled as Dom reached us.
 "I'll leave her in your care then, Mistress Sanchez?"
 Alec watched Donovan leave, and then turned back to the pack and chivvied them back into motion.
 I grabbed onto Dom's hand with enough force to bruise a normal person as Isaac and James turned on each other with a sudden ferocity that left me breathless.
 "It's okay.
 They're training, sparring if you will."

 Do your best to convince her you spent the night safely at home.

 Also, if you can convince her it's safe to leave on an extended trip, that would be very helpful.

There isn't any way my car would make it where we need to go.
 We're headed to Vincent's to hitch a ride in his truck."
 'Truck' turned out to be an understatement.
 I'd marveled more than once since getting to Utah, at just how big some of the pickup trucks I saw driving around were.
 It seemed like nobody was willing to drive anything around the way it came off of the showroom floor.
 Everything had bigger wheels, and suspension that lifted it up several inches.
 Vincent's truck had more in common with the beasts in monster truck rallies than it did with the souped-up vehicles I'd seen driving around town.
 The tires were the biggest I'd seen on anything outside of a tractor, and the lift kit on it was so outrageously tall that I was pretty sure someone was going to have to lift me into the cab.
 By myself it was going to take a rope and climbing shoes.

 They swirled in the air above the elf like a tornado, and all at once they plunged downward, deep into his flesh.

God made Eric for a world someplace farther beyond our imaginations than any of us can comprehend.
 Someplace where he could run with the wind all day."
 Our friend Kenny Neidermeyer's mom was a Spanish teacher who also volunteered with a Tijuana charity.
 Since June, four of us had been riding with her to Tijuana every Sunday to play a double-header for a ball team the charity sponsored.
 The Liga Municipal, Segunda Fuerza, held its games on a sandlot with a makeshift backstop and a couple of benches along each sideline, one for the players, one for the fans.
 Our teammates were mostly the older sons of squatter families whose homes, made of scraps of tin, wood, and cardboard, balanced on narrow ridges along the walls of the Ca√±on del Sol, which ran down off the mesa to the border.
 Eddie Carmichael and Kenny were swift outfielders who would later play college ball.
 Bob Simmons would one day pitch for the Minnesota Twins.

The five human soldiers raised their shields and charged as a single unit.
 Felewen stood next to Aurelia, her sword high and her armor gleaming.
 She kept the blade out and pointed at the center soldier.
 When the bolt of lightning came shrieking out from Aurelia‚Äôs hands, that same soldier found himself lifted from the ground, his hands flailing, his useless sword and shield falling.
 The blue electricity entered through a second soldier‚Äôs body through his right eye.
 He died instantly.
 Then the remaining three were upon the elves, and it was Felewen‚Äôs turn to kill.
 The first soldier to swing at her found his sword cut from his body, his hand still clutching it as it flew through the air.
 He cowered back, pulling his bleeding arm behind his shield.

She wanted to teach at a college.
 In first grade, she had decided to become a teacher.
 Over thirteen years, K-8, she missed only two days of school, and those were unavoidable.
 Her Christian school was showing an early film version of Tim LeHay‚Äôs Left Behind saga, and Pam couldn‚Äôt bear the sight of nice enough pastors getting left behind.
 She won an academic scholarship to Pepperdine University and worked her way through two Masters degrees.
 But to teach where she wanted to go, she needed a PhD.
 A baby might stand in the way of her career, she believed, and I couldn‚Äôt argue.
 Besides, with a little good fortune and without the cost of another dependent, as soon as Darcy and Cody finished college I could take early retirement from my day job and devote myself to writing, which had been my dream for too many years.
 I longed for the freedom to run off for weeks at a time to some hermitage where I could think better and write with deeper concentration.
 I harbored a suspicion that my writing career has always been stopped at the edge of a breakthrough by distracting worries, usually about family and finances.

 ‚ÄúMorning.‚Äù ‚ÄúGood morning Emily, sleep well?‚Äù I asked, wondering if she had the same type of dream as we did.
 She shrugged.
 ‚ÄúI slept soundly, why?‚Äù ‚ÄúNothing, just curious.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she stood up and tip toed towards Jason.
 ‚ÄúNow the best part, waking up the grump.‚Äù She bent over close to his ear.

Of course that'd only lasted for about a nanosecond.
 Even in a dream, there were things that were just too scary to really entertain.
 The dream lasted longer than any of the others before it, but even so it eventually lapsed into a normal, boring dream.
 Still, I woke up feeling more refreshed and rested than any other time I could remember.
 Even more amazing, the feeling was strong enough to carry me through Biology and Mrs. Sorenson's relentless grilling.
 I did better than expected, but still not as well as I'd hoped.
 Not considering how much time I'd spent studying.
 It was like she knew exactly which parts I didn't understand completely, and after letting me start to get a little bit of false confidence, she'd hammer me down again.
 Talk about depressing.

Once again he followed up with the same move, stepping forward and slamming his shield forward to either knock his opponent‚Äôs weapon or knock the guard himself down.
 Unfortunately, when Rodregas hit this guard he matched his every move for move.

 Rodregas had gotten too comfortable with his opponents not being able to match his strength.
 This guard did.
 The Immortal Guard had already launched himself forward and Rodregas‚Äô own speed worked against him.
 As Rodregas‚Äô short sword hit nothing but air, he felt the sharp agony of the guard‚Äôs blade piercing his thigh.

 Sketching helped block out all of the inane conversation that'd taken over the other corner of the room.
 It was amazing how easily I was able to zone out while drawing.
 Once again, I didn't try to guide my hand, just let my subconscious create a horizon and start fleshing out a body of water and droopy trees around it.

He didn't have much faith-- Marie's scream almost made him drop the chicken.
 Depositing the pan on the stove, he ran to the living room.
 She was sitting up, gasping for breath, a look of terror on her face.
 "What's wrong?"
 he asked, hovering over her.
 "I want to go home!
 I don't belong here--I want to go home!"
 Her heart was beating wildly, and she was having a hard time catching her breath.
 The fear and panic that had faded with fatigue and the novelty of it all were suddenly back full force, and all she knew was that she was far from home and from everything she knew.

If not remedied, this could result in a reversal of the remarkable progress towards world peace achieved during the past seven years.
 Arms exports: The cutting of defence budgets has generated increasing pressure on arms manufacturers to seek export markets.
 Although the value (in 1992 US dollars) of arms exports fell by more than 50 per cent from 1988 to 1992, it still represents nearly $20 billion annually.
 These weapons, over 80 per cent of which are supplied by the five permanent members of the Security Council, directly contribute to the growing instability and violence.
 During the last decade, 40 per cent of these weapons were sold to trouble spots such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.
 These are, indeed, severe challenges that call for urgent and determined action by the global community on a scale unprecedented during times of peace.
 But the lessons of the past decade should caution us against accepting as a fait accompli statistical projections that predict the outcome of our effort over the next ten years before it has even begun.
 No such determinism exists, except in our minds.
 Given the right leadership, we can change the course, amend the rules, alter the structures and accelerate action to achieve an entirely different and more favourable set of outcomes.
 Our future is not a question of fate.

Sylvia had a piano, the only treasure in a living room full of hand-me-down furniture.
 When Richard wasn‚Äôt plunking on it, weaving garrulous runs around the melodies of old standards, he gawked at TV horror movies.
 Eric, Sylvia, and I discussed religion and books.
 She attended no church but disdained atheists.
 Lord of the Flies she called propaganda by which teachers could argue the superiority of adults.
 Catcher in the Rye she applauded because Holden Caulfield appreciated jazz and was nearly as cynical as herself.

 While we gabbed, Richard might eye us as though he had something to say.

They spoke in low voices, and as I tried to figure a way past, something seized my attention.
 ‚ÄúEvelyn has been a model citizen‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt seem right‚Ä¶‚Äù My nerves twitched as the worry from that day returned.
 As I remembered the risk I‚Äôd put myself under coming here.

 My ears popped.
 And then, at once, the group began to scratch at themselves feverishly, clawing at forearms, abdomens, and necks.
 Each wore an uncomfortable, even frightened, expression as they hurried out of the room and into an inner Council chamber.

Rodregas could not help but think about how out of his depth he was trying to interfere with the ritual ceremony.
 However, as he forced the beautiful woman forward, the woman whose name he had refused to learn, he knew he was indeed going to try.
 ‚ÄúI will do it this time,‚Äù Rodregas thought to himself, ‚ÄúThis time I will not choose my survival over others.‚Äù His life was not worth living if he did nothing again; he wanted to feel at least a small measure of being the man he had been raised to be.
 ‚ÄúCelestial Gods, please let my life be worth something in death, if not in life,‚Äù he prayed quietly.
 Captain Poir and Rodregas carefully put the two prisoners in the middle of their circles, and then stepped out.
 They each picked up small wooden clubs.
 Dale and Junnit stood across from the two of them holding matching clubs.
 The ceremony required the prisoners to stay in each circle unbound.
 The job of the guards was to remain outside the circle but make sure that the prisoners stayed inside.
 Metal would interfere with the magic so the guards held simple wooden clubs and wore only linen clothes with no metal fastenings.

 Out of my left eye I saw the outline of a creature.

 But before he could ride out she asked, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt suppose you want to explain why you wanted to know about them?‚Äù ‚ÄúI am not sure, just thinking about options,‚Äù he answered.
 Then he pulled Doom Hoof through a wide turn and tried to get him moving and warmed up.
 If the beast felt any excitement or nervousness he was not showing it.
 Which Rodregas admitted was better than the opposite reaction.
 But the horse felt incredibly sluggish compared to his own mount.
 Hopefully, the horses positive qualities would shine in the tournament.

Rodregas nodded; he had been waiting for the comment, but he had thought it would be Imeralda who brought it up.
 ‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúunless you have a way of smoothing it out.‚Äù Rodregas waited for a few seconds as the three approached the main farmhouse building.
 The walls were of thick cut stone and it was built on an impressive scale for a farmhouse, though worn-looking.
 Of course, there were no signs of a roof, doors or windows.
 As they entered the yard, the feeling of the hair standing up on their bodies settled down and instead a feeling of fullness replaced it.
 The horses had been acting up and Rodregas hoped that with the energy smoothing out, the horses would stop fighting their lines.
 Though in truth the horses seemed to be getting more agitated.
 As the magic smoothed out Rodregas smiled and said, ‚ÄúThe ley line would be as much of a problem as a help unless, of course, the farmhouse is made of Nymph stone.‚Äù Rodregas expected the sound of pleased surprise but instead heard alarmed in-drawn breaths from them both; he saw that they were looking to the right, where he suddenly noticed movement.

Strange feeling it stirred in me, realizing that my intervention to keep Brandon out of prison could backfire so terribly.
 Before he got help now, he would need to hit rock bottom.
 Hopefully he‚Äôd survive it.
 Then, one day Thomas called.
 Brandon just contacted him from some street corner in a bad part of town outside of San Diego.
 Brandon said he was broke, addicted, alone and ready to commit himself to rehab.
 Thomas said he had dropped what he was doing and was driving directly to find him, as he knew Brandon might change his mind.
 Thomas said that most drug addicts would take every drug they could get their hands on if they knew they were going to rehab, and this was dangerous.
 He was off to the rescue!
 Thomas called again when he had Brandon in his car, saying while Brandon looked horrible, he was alive and on his way to a detox center, which would be followed by rehab‚Äîhopefully.

He scanned the battlefield while they whirled up and down, over one hand and then dancing away from another.
 Just as Sonowin pulled higher and higher into the air, outracing more than seven growing hands reaching up for them, the elf spotted two lone figures amid the sea of dead.
 ‚ÄúSonowin,‚Äù he shouted to his steed.
 ‚ÄúThere, you must get to them!‚Äù
 The horse snorted, banked around, and dove straight for the approaching hands.
 A quick spiral avoided the first wave.
 Dieredon clutched his bow and held on for dear life, his eyes locking on the man in black who stood perfectly still, his arms at downward angles from his body.
 The rest of the elves were in full retreat.

Two adjacent homes were already ablaze, their occupants still inside.

 The wood blackened, smoke billowed from his hands, and then the entire building erupted as if bathed in oil.
 Qurrah laughed, untouched by the heat.
 He could not say the same for the elves, and as their pained screams reached his ears he only laughed louder.
 The half-orc ran as people flooded the streets, calling out for buckets and water.
 Too many homes were aflame.
 They could no longer cower within them and hope to be spared.

I felt my eyes go wide as I realized what he was saying.
 It made me think of the stray kitten we'd taken in for a few months when I was five.
 Cindi and I had spent hours teasing it with pieces of string, watching its tiny head dart back and forth from one to the other as it tried to decide whether to pounce on them, or dart away and hide under the bed.
 It'd been really amusing when it had been a half-pound kitten, but the thought of having a two-hundred-plus pound wolf attacking me because I'd triggered some kind of fight or flight instinct wasn't so funny.
 "Oh, I didn't realize it was a problem.

Best of all, there'd been absolutely no hint that she'd blabbed to anyone else.
 I settled deeper into my seat, opening my program as the orchestra started warming up.
 It was amazing to think the near-chaos currently drifting up from the pit would transform itself into the glorious strains of the Overture in just a few minutes.
 I was so intent on the program it should've taken a small explosion to bring my head around, but something caused me to look up as Alec walked past the drapes.
 He looked even more gorgeous than normal.
 I'd gone back and forth, both with myself, and with Rachel, on how much to dress up.
 Going in normal street clothes would've cheapened the experience, but I hadn't wanted to stick out too much from the rest of the kids, all of whom I'd been pretty sure would be in shorts and polos.
 I'd been right, which had made me glad I'd compromised and come in my one and only sun dress.

Rodregas headed back to Doi‚Äôvan who said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that technique is what the knights had in mind.‚Äù His voice showed his personal pleasure, knowing that a move he had taught Rodregas lead to his victory.
 Rodregas nodded and said, ‚ÄúDecided that my advantage of strength was being matched by armor and steed, so it was time to use agility.
 I was not sure it would work.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt will be harder the next time.
 Good luck,‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan said.
 Rodregas‚Äô next opponent for the joust was riding a powerful war steed and was in the dark non-reflective brown of full Night Bronze armor.
 Rodregas recognized the simple gray banner of Geriodon.
 His arm was decorated with the ribbons of his accomplishments in the tournament to date.
 As the flag fell it seemed like Geriodon was half way to Rodregas before Doom Hoof started to move.

 Life couldn't get any better.
 I was going to Les Mis√©rables with Rachel, and I only had two more hours before Brandon would be taking me home.

 It was like the time between when he picked me up and dropped me off didn't even exist.
 One moment I'd be blah and mundane, then next I'd be with him and the world was perfect.
 When I was by myself, it was hard to believe it all hadn't been a dream.
 Thursday morning flew by, it was like I blinked and it was already time for Mrs. Campbell's class.

Harruq swung Condemnation left, deflecting the incoming thrust.
 His other blade stabbed, tearing away the soft flesh beneath his attacker‚Äôs ribcage.
 The elf leapt back, landed shakily, and then lunged once more.
 His speed was not what it should have been, though, and Harruq needed little opening.
 He swung both swords, the entirety of his might behind them.
 The elf blocked.
 His sword was elven-make and had been wielded in his hands for two hundred years.
 Never would he have guessed Harruq‚Äôs were older by three centuries.
 Never would he have guessed that those two blades would shatter his own, pass through the explosion of steel, sever his spine, and cleave his body in two.

Was Rodregas really that strong?
 Or was the bed just lighter than it looked?
 He went back over to the trunk and lifted it up; it to went up too easily and felt strangely light.
 Next he went over the dresser.
 Rodregas had known that the physical essence of the celestial lion was in his body and that all of his physical attributes would be improved, but the strength of the Immortalist was not common knowledge; you just heard that they were long lived and never got sick.
 They used magic against their foes not swords, and they seldom got involved in physical struggles.
 Of course Rodregas had known that in The Immortal Guard of the Guild the most loyal and powerful of their officers were given enhanced bodies, but he thought their power lay in their magical sigils.
 His new body was very large and very muscular, and much stronger than he would have guessed.

Presently, around 800 million people living in 46 countries are malnourished and 40,000 die every day of hunger and hunger-related diseases.
 Widespread famine currently threatens nine African countries, where the lives of 20 million people are at risk.
 Hunger and famine are usually associated with a physical shortage of food.
 Yet, even where food supplies are adequate, absence of opportunities for gainful employment to generate the purchasing power needed to buy food can result in hunger.
 Lack of food and employment are the basis for the poverty that still afflicts one-fifth of humankind.
 When it comes to food there can be no justification or excuse ‚Äì everyone must have enough to eat, and can have enough.
 A world dedicated to upholding the political rights and property rights of nations and individuals cannot fail to recognize and enforce the most fundamental of all human rights ‚Äì the right to live.
 Contrary to the fears raised in earlier centuries and revived in recent decades, today the world does possess the capacity to feed everyone, even at current levels of food production ‚Äì subject as it is to disincentives, quotas, restrictions and trade barriers that food surplus countries impose to curtail food production, while other nations remain in perpetual deficit.
 In spite of a doubling of population in the developing countries since 1960, their average food supplies have increased from 1950 calories to 2475 calories per capita per day, or from an average of 90 per cent to 107 per cent of the minimum caloric requirement.
 During the past 12 years alone, per capita food production in developing countries has risen by 15 per cent.

 today, staple foods have accounted for nearly 4092m percent0m of the output of manufacturers in the developing world and accumulated92m large0m economic wealth ‚Äì driven by increased92m export0m to sale92m-0mmaking countries and thus ideas for long-term and sustainable sources92m of0m food.<eop><eod> The Rouen Grand Tour - 1-

Trying to be as casual as possible, I looked into the art room as I hobbled by, but they'd rearranged their stations, and someone's easel was in the way now.
 The sprained ankle had slowed me down enough that there was no way I was going to make it back to my locker before the bell rang.
 Still, I tried to be gracious when it went off just as I handed Mrs. North the papers.
 Based on the number of classrooms on the second floor, and the narrowness of the stairs, there was no point in trying to wait the crowd out.
 I gritted my teeth and limped out into the surge of bodies.
 Surprisingly enough, there were more familiar faces than expected.
 As I grabbed the handrail on the right, I noticed Isaac several feet ahead of me.
 Of course, it's hard to miss someone nearly six feet tall and almost as well-muscled as Alec.
 Even if he was partially hidden by Vincent, who was strutting along a little higher up the stairs with all of his usual arrogance.

This results in higher incomes for its workers and makes their products more affordable in other countries, which in turn raises standards of living abroad.
 The resultant rise in real incomes domestically and overseas stimulates demand for more of these products as well as for other products that can be produced locally or imported from overseas.
 Trade also tends to raise the quality of jobs in an economy.
 It forces higher-wage countries and their workers to specialize in technology-intensive and skill-intensive occupations that pay higher wages.
 At the same time, it also raises the wages of less-skilled jobs in low-wage countries by increasing the demand for workers to produce for overseas markets.
 The problem in the more developed countries is that the demand for low-skilled jobs declines and the gap in wages between skilled and unskilled jobs tends to increase, resulting in a decline in incomes and employment opportunities for lower levels of the population in these countries.
 This is a natural, healthy process of social development in which different sectors serve as engines for growth at different stages.
 The upward job displacement that earlier shifted job opportunities from agriculture to industry now shifts them to higher-skilled jobs in manufacturing and services.
 The negative side-effects of this process on some sections of the population alert us to areas where society must make special efforts to speed their development.

The eventual recipients of these pills will be the addicts who crave them more than a next meal or the love of their family, or anything for that matter.
 The pills are small, round and an odd green color‚Äîa powerful prescription drug manufactured to relieve severe pain.
 They are essentially synthetic heroin, and much sought after by the drug addicts who litter your streets, work alongside you and perhaps sit next to you at a family dinner.
 They are daughters or sons or parents.
 The street price for these pills could reach up to $80 each while the co-pay at the pharmacy for the insured who are prescribed these pills could be as little as $10 for a quantity of ninety.
 That is quite a tidy profit for all involved, and the sellers do not care what casualties wait.
 That is about all that stays the same in the drug world decade after decade.
 The pill commonly referred to by the street name ‚ÄúOxy‚Äù does not get swallowed by addicts in the way the pharmaceutical companies intended.
 To intensify the effect of the drug, they consume the pills in alternative ways: First, they remove the time release coating that covers the pill by either scrapping it off with their fingernail or using a wet paper towel.
 Then, they crush the tablet into a powder and snort it.

 He seemed to be waiting for me to speak.

These farmers tend to have lower levels of education, poor access to technology for upgrading productivity, less access to quality inputs and credit, poor access to storage and processing facilities, and higher losses due to post-harvest crop spoilage.
 Their problems are further aggravated by environmental degradation due to soil erosion, deforestation and depletion of water resources.
 Lack of effective organization and management is a common denominator linking all these deficiencies.
 More effective forms of organizations can eliminate or compensate for these deficiencies to a large extent.
 For example, in India more than 10 million farmers are successfully engaged in sugarcane cultivation, precisely because an established system of contract farming provides them with access to technology, quality inputs, credit and an assured market for their produce.
 India became the world leader in milk production only because of the power of scale conferred on small producers through the dairy cooperative movement.
 A similar organization is presently lacking for most other crops.
 The successful establishment of more than one million Self-Help Groups (SHGs) in India over the past three years providing access to credit for 15 million small farmers illustrates the power of organization.
 It is an indication that the phase of society‚Äôs predominant dependence on government initiatives for development is coming to a close.
 An organization combining the advantages of SHGs and contract farming through the agency of an NGO or an agri-business centre operated by farm and home science graduates or entrepreneurs can be successfully extended to other crops, providing the technical knowledge and essential inputs that small farmers need to raise productivity and farm incomes.

I retrieved the leather pouch from the bed to examine the contents, but before I loosened the binding I heard a crash behind me; three council guards had busted open my door.
 I tucked the pouch under the long bell sleeve of the dress as they crossed the room to seize me by the arms.
 Chapter Five Trials
 I stood in the center of a council chamber I had never before seen.
 Vast libraries lined the walls, interspersed with decorated frames and ornate mirrors.
 A great vaulted ceiling rose overhead, embellished with intricate carvings, painted in every detail.
 Across the empty space before me was an elaborate table that seated six leaders of High Council.
 The guards who had brought me here were standing behind me, within arm‚Äôs reach on either side.
 Left of them were council members and, as I glanced right, Chevelle walked in to stand at attention, facing the council table.
 I could hear others enter behind us, presumably witnesses, and I wondered if Junnie was among them.

She grew warm imagining a pleasure greater than what he'd made her feel a few minutes ago.

 When she didn't respond, he tilted her chin up, making her look into his eyes.
 "Stay here, Marie.

 We'll have a wedding night more exciting than anything you could imagine."
 Her breath caught, and tears filled her eyes.

It was already starting to seem more like a normal, safe dream.
 I put on jeans and a button-up shirt, and then all but stumbled downstairs with my backpack in hand.
 Sometime during the night Mom had put our message board up on the fridge.
 Went shopping, food in the fridge, don't forget breakfast and lunch.
 See you tonight after school.
 Love you.
 --Mom I shook my head resignedly; you'd think the message would have changed at least a little over the last few weeks, but it was still pretty much the same.
 'Don't forget to eat, I'll be back later, but it might be a couple of days.'

 An upward cut took the blade from the elf‚Äôs hand.
 Antonil‚Äôs sword looped around, thrust forward, and buried deep inside flesh.
 The elf fell, gasping for air from the fatal wound.
 Blood pooled below him.
 Antonil pulled his sword free and saluted him with the blade.

She was still whispering, but the words sheared through the darkness, arresting my fall.
 I didn't want him here, didn't want to give him another reason to despise me.
 What if Jasmin came with him?
 The thought of lying helpless with her in the same room sent shivers of cold sliding down me.
 I couldn't see, so I reached out, blindly trying to find the phone before Rachel could dial Alec.
 My questing hand finally found the tiny, hard-plastic package, and I grabbed on with all of my fading strength.
 The darkness was still beckoning, but alternating images of Jasmin and Alec flashed before my eyes.
 I was so confused that I couldn't make sense of the flood of emotions that accompanied the pictures, other than the fact that terror came to the forefront as they sped up.
 Faster and faster the two figures changed places, and then they disappeared.

A sudden purging of blood vessels exploded across Ahrqur‚Äôs side.
 The force smashed him into a decorative table.
 He rolled off the broken thing and glanced down at the blood soaking his robe.
 Despite the wound, no cut or hole was visible in the cloth.

I thought about calling him out on it, but with my life suddenly looking like I was all but friendless, that didn't seem like such a good idea.
 Without really meaning to I'd managed to alienate just about everyone at school.
 Brandon already had plenty of reasons not to be with me, it was the height of stupidity to give him any more.
 I could probably deal with not having a boyfriend, even assuming that was what we were right now.
 Going half a year without anyone to talk to because my mom was wrapped up with her art and everyone else in the town thought I was stuck-up would be more than I could take.
 The thought was enough to leave me speechless for the entire drive home.
 Brandon seemed content to leave me alone with my thoughts as he sped around the various turns at speeds that normally would've made me protest.
 As I went to leave the car, he grabbed me by my back pocket, which nearly made me shriek in surprise.
 "Hey, you know what you need to put all this in perspective?"
 "No, but then I think it's more than just a matter of my perspective being off."

Wolves.
 There weren't supposed to be any wolves in the area, but there wasn't any ignoring my ears.
 I numbly pulled myself back up, and began stumbling back towards the party, only to stop as another howl echoed down through the canyon.
 It was between me and everyone else.
 I turned and started into a shuffling run.
 Maybe the wolf would be attracted to the noise and light.
 Maybe I'd be able to get far enough away it wouldn't smell me.
 I'd only been moving for about a minute before another howl sent chills running down my spine.
 It sounded like a different wolf, and it was closer than the first one.
 I tried to run faster, but all that time studiously avoiding exercise was working against me.

It was a goofy smile, and Qurrah recognized the fear hiding behind it.
 ‚ÄúHurry,‚Äù Qurrah said as Harruq climbed, using a windowsill as a foothold.
 Together, they stood upon the roof and gazed over the wall, mesmerized by the sight before them.
 Mere seconds away, hundreds and hundreds of orcs charged.
 Their race could see as well in night as in day.
 That same racial ability allowed the two brothers to watch the approaching orcs, lean muscle bulging underneath their sweat-glistened pale gray skin.
 Some wore mismatched armor, though most had only skulls, straps of leather, and war paint covering their bodies.
 Wave after wave of arrows rained upon them, and those who fell were trampled by the rest, but the masses were not even slowed.
 Harruq pointed past the army to where a long line of men stood in the distance, carrying no light or torch.

 His gaze was long and steady, but finally he nodded.

 She used the same cloth to clean the blood from her face.
 ‚ÄúCome,‚Äù she said.
 ‚ÄúWe must go north where we are needed most.‚Äù
 The two ran through the town, listening for sounds of battle.
 The worst seemed to be about the middle of Celed and steadily working its way south.

This squire, though, thrust the shield at him and collapsed to the ground.
 Rodregas looked around the arena to make sure no one was left to fight and then headed into the great hall, carrying the shield of the tournament champion.
 As he walked the hallway into the main hearing chamber, knights stood along the walls.
 As Rodregas passed they all mumbled the same words to him, ‚ÄúWelcome to the Order my brother.‚Äù Several reached out and shook his hand or showed other signs of welcome.
 Others, though, looked at him strangely, clearly put off by the way he had won the melee.
 He felt a little unsteady, not sure what to make of both the welcome and the uncomfortable looks.
 As he passed through the doors in the main hearing chamber, the Grand Marshal stood at the far end waiting.
 In the chamber were both knights and squires.
 Many smiled; he thought a few looked like the ones in the hall, not sure what to think of this new knight.
 Rodregas was not surprised that when he started to kneel in front of the Grand Marshal, for Van‚Äôdret to step forward and speak.

 If it resulted in me seeing Brandon again today it couldn't be all bad.
 In fact, my life felt pretty much perfect right now.

 I felt myself blushing almost as soon as the thought crossed my mind.
 My family wasn't...hadn't been demonstrative.
 I wouldn't know what to do if he hugged me.

 She was going to Hollywood!

 Deciding to do an aerobics tape until it was light enough to walk in the garden, she put on her workout clothes and went downstairs.
 She didn't know how she was going to be able to wait two entire days.
 She was so excited that she felt like she could run all the way to Hollywood.
 After 45 minutes of aerobics, she still wasn't tired!

My mind kept returning to Brandon, and the question of why he was taking such an interest in me.
 It wasn't until I'd returned Mrs. Alexander's reference book to its shelf and sat down at my desk that I remembered I'd had to do the entire 'group' project by myself.
 Alec hadn't even bothered to come to Physics since the assignment had been given.
 My entire life I'd had people try and sponge off of my work, and I was way beyond sick and tired of it.
 By the time Alec strode into class looking like the inspiration for every romance novel ever written, I was really mad.
 I hardly waited for him to sit down before I pulled my desk a little closer and hissed at him.
 "So very nice of you to come to class on the day our stupid assignment is due."
 Alec's expression was remarkable in that I'd never seen anyone look so full of life while simultaneously failing to betray even the slightest hint of emotion.
 He didn't even open his mouth as he reached into his bag and pulled out a bundle of densely-packed typewritten pages.
 The arrogance of it all.

 I was halfway to the front door before Mom grabbed my arm and turned me back towards the kitchen.
 "I can't believe you.

 Maybe Fannie should have been punished for whatever she had done, but how could they assume I would follow in her footsteps?

Brandon was coming up behind Vincent, as Alec reached up and placed his own hand on Vincent's chest, with another, stronger flash of power.

 Alec's hand and fingers had elongated, turning into a hairless replica of the deadly claw that'd terrified me just a few days before.
 Vincent's bulk was such that it screened Alec's movements from passersby, as those razor-sharp claws sank just the barest distance into his chest.
 Alec spoke for the first time, and the even tone of his words was a stark contrast to the winds of power that seemed almost ready to throw me across the hall.
 "You forget yourself, mutt.
 As the leader of another pack, I'm due more respect than that.
 Should you or your dominant wish to push things further, I guarantee that your heart will decorate the floor before he can come to your aid."
 Brandon stopped moving as Alec's words carried to him.
 He was probably weighing odds and tabulating the probable cost of the various courses of action available to him.

By the time I signed my name to a brightly-colored pink slip of paper, dropped it into the box, and walked out past the ridiculously-long line of people still waiting to enter the drawing, I knew for a certainty that I wasn't going.
 They'd posted the cost of the tickets, and I'd been right.
 My paycheck wasn't going to cut it.
 I was still trying to decide whether or not to head back into the cafeteria, when the first bell rang, signaling a fitting end to a disappointment-filled lunch.
 History wasn't any better, and we had a sub for Physics.
 Alec actually walked into class, saw Mrs. Alexander wasn't there, and then turned around and left.
 It was possibly the most brazen act of class cutting I'd ever seen, and somehow it didn't surprise me in the least.
 Even so, I spent the rest of the hour stewing while working on the pointless, busywork assignment the sub handed out.
 Mrs. Tiggs still hadn't finished grading our tests, which meant I still had no idea how I'd done.
 By the time I finally half-collapsed at my normal table in the tutor lab, all I could think about was how nice it would be to see Brandon one more time as he drove me home.

‚ÄúIt keeps getting stranger,‚Äù he muttered.
 He took a step and immediately regretted it.
 As his leg throbbed, he yanked the arrow out.
 His armor had kept it from penetrating too deeply, the barbs unable to latch onto any soft flesh.
 Of course it still hurt like the abyss, but he could deal with that.
 What he could not deal with, however, was how few in number his soldiers had become.
 More than four of his own men lay dead around him, joined by three dead elves, five if he counted the two the half-orc had thrown through the doorway.
 A good ratio considering the skill of the elves, but not good enough.
 Men he had trained were dying, and for what?

Normally I'd have just viewed her theatrics with amusement, but it'd been a long day and I wasn't in the mood.
 If I'd known for sure where we were heading, I'd have considered cutting her off, even with all of the probable fallout, but I didn't.
 Instead I just sighed, followed her around a corner, and collided with six-plus feet of muscled goodness packaged in a white polo shirt that looked worryingly familiar.
 Brandon caught me as I rebounded from him, easily stopping my momentum before I could stumble into a locker.
 "We'd better be careful; I'm starting to sense a trend."
 I wanted to say something equally witty, but his shirt did wonderful, probably illegal things to his gray eyes, and his perfectly straight teeth were parted in a friendly grin that couldn't possibly be meant for me.
 I managed a feeble grin before the silence stretched too far towards becoming uncomfortable, but it was a pathetic attempt.
 Brandon gently released my shoulders and detoured around me with a grace that should have looked unnatural on a boy, but which somehow exuded more masculinity than any four boys I'd known back home.
 Britney shot me an envious look and then turned and stalked through an open doorway.
 I should have been worried I was upsetting my only 'friend'.

My body was meant to live in a place that has more magic than our world does, but the lines are chaotic.
 It is hard to sleep on a wild line.
 It is going to be hard to stay here for long.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs deep voice had the tone of making a simple observation, not conversation.
 Rodregas nodded; he had been waiting for the comment, but he had thought it would be Imeralda who brought it up.
 ‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúunless you have a way of smoothing it out.‚Äù Rodregas waited for a few seconds as the three approached the main farmhouse building.
 The walls were of thick cut stone and it was built on an impressive scale for a farmhouse, though worn-looking.
 Of course, there were no signs of a roof, doors or windows.
 As they entered the yard, the feeling of the hair standing up on their bodies settled down and instead a feeling of fullness replaced it.
 The horses had been acting up and Rodregas hoped that with the energy smoothing out, the horses would stop fighting their lines.
 Though in truth the horses seemed to be getting more agitated.

 ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù Chevelle said, still kneeling over me.
 Grey hesitated, rubbed a palm awkwardly over the woven material of his shirt.
 ‚ÄúA horse is at the door.‚Äù Chevelle glanced at me, I hoped he didn‚Äôt see my smile.
 I knew it was my Steed.
 Grey waited.
 ‚ÄúWell, should I let him in?‚Äù Chevelle nodded once and Grey left as quickly as he‚Äôd entered.

Instead my mind reached down and pulled extra layers of gauze over itself.
 I looked down at my Spanish test and wondered how I'd gotten here.
 There were answers on the page.
 They were unmistakably done in my awkward scrawl, but didn't make sense.
 I flipped the page over and found more of the same.
 My eyes idly traced down the page, finding blanks and almost of its own accord my pencil reached out and filled them in with words that seemed familiar, but whose meaning I couldn't seem to pin down.
 I resurfaced as I walked into the tutor lab, unsure if I'd passed anyone I should have greeted.
 I sat down at my usual spot and pulled out a book at random as Britney stomped into the room and threw her books down.
 She was obviously mad, but once again I couldn't muster enough concern to figure out what'd ticked her off.
 I blinked several times as I realized Mrs. Campbell had been speaking to me for several seconds.

Tinkling bells and all that aside, it really did sound like the kind of laugh you'd hear described for the princess of a fairy tale.
 Had I really never heard her laugh before, or was it just that she hadn't ever meant it before?
 "She left about five minutes before James did."
 "Still chatting up her prime candidate for the big dance?"
 Rachel nodded as we skirted the last two tables between us and the one exterior door in the tutor lab.
 "Yep, she's definitely settled on Tim Parsons, who's perfect if you like your men fairly handsome, moderately popular, and built like an ox."
 I wanted to protest, but if anything Rachel was being too kind.
 I'd seen Tim trying to sound out the captions underneath the pictures in Sports Illustrated of his favorite pro football players.

 She squinted closer and saw that Jazell had tried to make the line some sort of sword but epically failed.

 ‚ÄúYou know, you do have your own room.‚Äù He stiffened and stood, not at all amused by her implication.

 ‚ÄúSo how did it go?‚Äù He relaxed a little but his mood didn‚Äôt rise in the least.
 ‚ÄúWe shall see.‚Äù ‚ÄúIndeed,‚Äù she purred.

Rodregas unrolled the blanket on the back of the now mostly empty wagon showing the dozen books that he had saved from Ravenhurr‚Äôs library.
 Imeralda reached out for one of the closest, but then stopped as her fingers touched them, as if a spark of lightning had hit her.
 Obviously, she could feel that same power Rodregas had.
 That was interesting.
 She then ran her hand from one to the next until she had touched all twelve books.
 Then, she looked up and her expression reminded Rodregas of some girl who had gotten the perfect mid winter gift that she had been dreaming of.
 ‚ÄúThese are not books on magic,‚Äù she said.
 ‚ÄúThese are Grimoires, several of them of great power.‚Äù ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù Rodregas said, ‚ÄúI was a squire who learned a little magic, but I really can‚Äôt say that I know the difference between a book of magic and a Grimoire.‚Äù Imeralda looked surprised and said, ‚ÄúOh, you guys must depend on the oral tradition.
 That is a hard way to learn.
 The symbols and geometric figures that form a powerful spell are often too complex to learn from just the spoken word.‚Äù Rodregas cut in and clarified, ‚ÄúI mean, in the order we did read books on magic theory and history, but I never felt energy from them before.‚Äù Imeralda nodded, ‚ÄúLet me explain.

 Olga Savitsky was a poet.
 We met at a small church charismatic enough so that nobody minded when she stood in the midst of a service and offered her latest poem.

A momentary ripple of stillness swept through the pack, and then Dominic reappeared, this time walking on two legs.
 I'd been too overwhelmed by everything else to really register the fact that everyone was wearing some form of stretchy clothing.
 I'd never thought about how changing shapes must make for difficulty when it came to clothing choices, but it appeared someone had solved the problem.
 Dom's black outfit had perfectly matched her fur, and whatever it was, it had shrunk down to fit her four-legged form, while still having enough elasticity to expand out to cover her person shape.
 The girl's clothes had an elastic band of some kind at their necks, legs and arms, while the boys were wearing a pants-like number which cinched down over their waist, as well as just above the knees.
 My preoccupation over what everyone was wearing gave Dom a chance to cover the distance between us.
 Donovan smiled as Dom reached us.
 "I'll leave her in your care then, Mistress Sanchez?"
 Alec watched Donovan leave, and then turned back to the pack and chivvied them back into motion.
 I grabbed onto Dom's hand with enough force to bruise a normal person as Isaac and James turned on each other with a sudden ferocity that left me breathless.

I had to catch that line of thought before it spiraled out of control; I concentrated on finding something small.
 A tiny pebble lay on the ground at my feet.
 I focused on it hard, willing it to rise.
 When nothing happened I looked for Chevelle‚Äôs reaction.
 He watched me, his serene mask back in place.
 ‚ÄúDo you need motivation?‚Äù I was afraid of the kind of motivation he‚Äôd provide, remembering the fireballs flying at me in the meadow.
 ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù My answer was too quick, and he laughed.
 I knelt closer to the gray rock.
 I thought it moved a little, as if trembling in fright, and the notion had me shaking my head.
 Chevelle stood.

It made Brandon more intriguing, but he hardly needed any more help there.
 With a sigh of frustration, I walked into Physics, smiled at Mrs. Alexander, and took my normal seat.
 I could pretty much set my watch by Alec's arrival.
 Apparently it wasn't cool to be caught inside a classroom more than fifteen seconds before the bell rang.
 It was a sign of just how far removed from reality I was that he was able to sit down in the other corner before I even realized he'd stepped through the door.
 I realized I must have been woolgathering for longer than I'd thought, and reached for my notebook.
 Only the bell should have rung by now, and it hadn't.
 I looked up at the clock and it confirmed that there was still at least a minute before class started.
 A slight rustle to my right brought my head around, and I looked up to find Alec smiling at me.
 I couldn't remember for sure if he'd ever smiled at me before, but I found myself suddenly positive he hadn't.

Alec pulled out his pocket square and used it to dab away my tears.
 "I'm sorry.

 My confusion must have been obvious.
 Dominic looked up from Jess.
 "Vincent and Cassie cut Jess and Isaac off from the rest of us."
 Rachel leaned in so she could whisper.
 "Jess is terrified of what Vincent and Brandon will do to her if they get a chance.

The greatest security challenges of the twenty-first century are economic, not military or political.
 Employment is a sine qua non for meeting these challenges.
 A thorough examination of facts and a dispassionate analysis reveal grounds for hope and opportunities for action.
 The possibility of more rapid economic growth and rising incomes in both developed and developing countries ‚Äì spurred by further substantial reduction in defence spending, the diffusion and application of new technologies, economic liberalization leading to growth of international trade, the globalization of financial markets, and the emergence of new engines for global expansion among developing countries ‚Äì indicates that our apprehensions need not prove justified, provided society acts courageously and decisively to meet the challenge.
 A global overview of employment cannot do full justice to the special circumstances, problems and potentials of specific regions and countries, but it can dispel the growing concern that employment has become a problem beyond the means of governments or the global economy to eradicate or even contain.
 In the final analysis, creation of jobs for all is not a question of possibility.
 It is a question of necessity.
 Neither logic nor self-interest justify a detached attitude or a half-hearted effort to address this issue.
 As in the case of the recent global response to the threat of global warming from depletion of the ozone layer, it simply is not acceptable for us to remain indifferent or claim that we are powerless to act where the entire world‚Äôs vital self-interests are at stake.
 When war threatens a nation‚Äôs borders, technology threatens its environment or unemployment threatens the livelihood of its people and the fabric of its social existence, there is only one acceptable response ‚Äì that is, action.

92m:0m millions of people are physical, emotional,92m and0m92m financial0m resources vulnerable to insufficient opportunity for improvement as well as military and political to92m these0m threats.

Government policies based on recognition of this fact can considerably improve the climate for development of these nations and correspondingly stimulate further growth in the West.
 Freer international trade will generate a flood of cheaper goods from the developing world that will give rise not only to greater purchasing power and higher standards of living for the Western consumer, but also to a ‚Äòdemand boom‚Äô for sophis ticated Western goods and services to improve infrastructure and meet the needs of billions of consumers in developing countries.
 The vast inequalities in living standards that persist within both developing and industrial nations, and between the most and least economically developed countries, result in an enormous global loss of incomes and jobs.
 Accelera ting the development of poorer nations and poorer sections of the population in each country is the most powerful instrument and the surest guarantee of continued growth of jobs and incomes for everyone in the next century.
 Strategies for Developing Countries
 For the developing countries as a whole, the most critical question is how to create quickly hundreds of millions of jobs for the poor with limited purchasing power and limited capital for investment.
 The idea that most of these jobs could be created in the corporate sector or by government-sponsored activities has been put to rest.
 Currently, there are nearly one billion self-employed and unpaid family workers in the world, most of them self-employed farmers in developing countries.
 The self-employed represent 48 per cent of the workforce in low-income economies (less than $500 per capita GDP).
 For any strategy to be successful, it must give central importance to self-employment and entrepreneurship, with emphasis on agriculture, agro-industry and small firms in the informal sector.

We can't just walk into the office and tell them we want to change our schedules.
 It doesn't work that way."
 ** After seeing Vincent's 'accident', and knowing he'd probably been trying to kill or at least seriously injure Ben just for the fun of it, I couldn't really argue with Alec.
 Rachel seemed relatively unfazed by the idea of bodyguards, but I wasn't especially excited about yet another point of difference between me and everyone else.
 Still, school was both better and worse than expected.
 As Alec had intimated, the day started out with a trip to the office.
 Not just me, not even just me and Alec.
 The entire pack trooped into the room, filling it with impeccably dressed, mostly gorgeous, shape shifters, who gave off a perceptible tingle of energy if you knew what to look for.
 I'd really thought Alec was tilting at windmills right up until he politely, but firmly asked for a brief meeting with the principal and was ushered into the other man's office five seconds later.
 Alec drew the blinds, which didn't do anything to muffle the principal's raised voice.

Brandon had to want to get better.
 As he packed his meager belongings, I grabbed the hand held video player and replayed the footage I had taped of him detoxing.
 He begged me to stop the video as he could hear himself on it screaming in agony as his body craved this drug.
 Brandon was crying uncontrollably as he tried to look away from the video that I continued to shove in front of his face.
 Lisa stood there pale and exhausted, frightened like the night of his intervention.
 As I remember it, she resembled my mother, so many years before, when we visited Thomas in prison.
 Lisa could not add even a word.
 Brandon left our home with little in his hands and got into what was once a nice little car, but was now something appropriate for a salvage yard with body damage, a driver‚Äôs door that wouldn‚Äôt open, and water leaking through missing door seals.
 Brandon had to get in from the passenger side of this wreck of a car, symbolic of his wreck of a life.

This has been aided by a worldwide rush to renewable energy power generation led by such regions as California, which now produces 10,000 megawatts of electricity from wind power and has mandated an increase in pollution-free motor vehicles from the present level of 5 per cent to 25 per cent by 2010.
 Common sense tells us it is not possible simply to wish away the serious problems barring these achievements.
 We need the technology vastly to improve productivity in poor countries.
 We need the organizational know-how to create effective administrative and political systems in transition states and to restructure international institutions.
 We require enormous investments in constructive economic activities ‚Äì as opposed to lavish arms spending ‚Äì to generate jobs and higher incomes for hundreds of millions of people in the developing world, and by extension to stimulate further economic growth and job creation in the West.
 All these essential ingredients are available in abundant measure, if only we choose to employ them for our common benefit.
 Yet even this is not enough.
 Otherwise, we would already have accomplished many of our goals.
 Above and beyond these material, social and financial resources, we need a new vision, a new perspective and new attitudes about what can and must be done.
 If the events of the past seven years prove anything, it is that a massive change of attitude and perspective, such as the one brought about between East and West, is imminently possible and incredibly powerful.

I found remnants inside, and ashes.
 A crude fire pit.
 Around that, several feet out, were various logs, I assumed for sitting around the pit for warmth.

 I ducked inside one and was shocked to see it was full of possessions.

My mind floated off into visions of a battered wolf who dragged himself over to a brook before collapsing on the bank, streaked with mud.
 Just before the blackness carried me completely away, a willowy girl appeared from behind a thicket of trees and timidly approached the bleeding figure.
 Chapter 30 The cool night air dimpled my skin despite the warmth of Alec's chest.
 We'd been walking for quite a while before I came fully awake.
 Dominic and Jasmin had shaken me awake, and then helped me out of my dress and into jeans and a white shirt.
 Donovan had been waiting in the hall just outside Alec's room.
 He'd pressed objects into Dom and Jasmin's hands, and then brushed his lips across the back of my hand.
 He slipped away, and then we'd entered a brightly-lit room filled with the rest of the pack.
 Alec had picked me up and carried me out to a massive SUV that I'd never seen before.
 Everyone piled in, and despite the seriousness of rapidly approaching events, I fell back asleep somewhere en route to our destination.

It seemed he had put more distance between them than he first thought.

A couple feet down from the headstone, he dug out a piece of sod, dropped a candy heart underneath it, and replaced the sod.
 We left the cemetery and parked just outside, and sat on the ground with our legs hanging over, about fifty feet above where the waves flooded the tide pools.
 Once before in this spot, Eric had mused that whenever he died, he wanted his ashes scattered from here, out toward the beach and sea.
 Several times, he placed a candy heart on his tongue, chewed slowly, and washed it down with the wine we had brought.

It was just close enough to see an amazingly thick cloud of insects swirl around it, captivated by the artificial glow.
 When I walked downstairs I found Mom's camping equipment piled in the living room.
 For all I'd tossed and turned, I must have gotten some sleep to have not heard her come in.
 I contemplated jotting down a note before just shrugging and skipping outside, happy for once to be shivering.
 It wouldn't last.
 Eventually the sun would clear the hills, and we'd be headed for eighty-plus degrees, but I could at least enjoy the next hour or so without worrying I was going to melt right out of my clothes.
 Walking down the lane, I tried to decide whether or not I wanted Brandon to show up today.
 After my mixed signals yesterday I figured there was a better than even chance he'd 'forget' to come get me.

 Everywhere, staining the earth a dark crimson, there was blood.

 Flames danced across the side of one house, alerting Qurrah.

Luckily, there was no wind down here to toss up the sand and dirt.

 Finally, Harruq voiced his thoughts.

 Qurrah stretched, letting out a small sigh as his back popped.

Most of the rest of the matches were with squires with no ribbons.
 But as the afternoon wrapped up his final match was against Karun who had two second place white ribbons on her arm.
 Rodregas was pretty sure this match would decide who got the yellow first place ribbon and who would get the white.
 If Rodregas won it would give him ten total points after three competitions.
 It would give Karun twelve points if she once more came in second.
 If he lost, it would be much harder.
 Karun would have thirteen and he would have nine points.
 He was not sure how Geriodon or Nordien or the other leading contestants were doing.

‚ÄúYou cannot take one of the blessings off the tree; it will wither and die if you try.‚Äù She winked at Rodregas as she said this.
 Imeralda then proceeded to eat the acorn shaped fruit; it took some work.
 It seemed to be a bit harder than any ripe fruit Rodregas knew of, but he followed her example and found that while it was tart it was amazing.
 It tasted of... Rodregas did not know what to call the flavor; the words that came to mind were sunlight and rain and the smell of a forest at night.
 When Rodregas finished the fruit completely he felt more whole but was also sad that it was gone.
 Imeralda seemed in great humor.
 ‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù she said.
 She dropped to her hands on the edge of the branch and then dropped down as if she was only feet from the ground which, strangely she was.

"And thereby the full effect of the Earth's curse was felt.
 Trapped as they were in their beast forms, neither brother could talk to the other, and the resulting confrontation quickly spun out of control.
 Hours later Adjam was left bleeding and broken as his brother disappeared into the night."
 Alec's soothing voice continued on, but I'd lost the ability to listen.
 My mind floated off into visions of a battered wolf who dragged himself over to a brook before collapsing on the bank, streaked with mud.
 Just before the blackness carried me completely away, a willowy girl appeared from behind a thicket of trees and timidly approached the bleeding figure.
 Chapter 30 The cool night air dimpled my skin despite the warmth of Alec's chest.
 We'd been walking for quite a while before I came fully awake.

 He kissed the top of her head.
 "We'll leave it at that for now, OK?"
 "OK." After a few moments, he raised his head and pulled away slightly.
 When she looked up at him, so beautiful and trusting and fragile, he bent his head to kiss her.
 But she turned her face away.
 "I'm sorry," he whispered, kissing her temple instead of her lips, her full, soft, luscious red lips .

I absorbed absolutely nothing from the rest of the discussion about calculating mechanical advantage, and when we were finally released into our groups Alec and I didn't even look each other in the eyes.
 I gutted out the last five minutes by pretending I was completely absorbed in a reference book while Alec started running preliminary calculations.
 He was out of his seat and halfway to the door by the time I'd even realized the bell had rung to dismiss us.
 Spanish was both better and worse.
 Better because without Alec sitting six feet away from me I was able to think about something other than him, worse because we had a pop quiz and I barely placed in the A- range despite having spent a fair amount of time on my vocabulary.
 Math was plain and simply burning up too much time.
 Something needed to change because my only hope of going to college was to get a scholarship, or load up on student loans, and I had no desire to graduate sixty thousand dollars in debt and spend the next fifteen years trying to pay it all off.
 By the time I met up with Britney in the hall I was emotionally exhausted and could feel an attack hovering in the wings.

A dark-furred form leaped at Jasmin, but the other wolf mistimed the spring.
 Most of the other pack didn't appreciate just how nimble she was.
 Jasmin dodged to one side and then the two of them were circling, looking for an opening.
 Vincent, the other hybrid, attacked with the strength and fury that'd earned him the position of second in his pack, but he hadn't been expecting to face me in this form.
 As a wolf I weighed in at a solid two hundred pounds, but would've still given up more than a hundred pounds to him.
 Now I had at least six inches and seventy-five pounds on my side of the equation, and he was the one pressed onto the defensive as the fight progressed.
 I caught flashes of action from the other fight as we circled each other.
 Jasmin sprang at her opponent, catching her behind the shoulders as Vincent reeled away from me in a shower of blood.
 I'd finally managed a deeper strike on his arm.
 The high-pitched scream of pain as Jasmin began trying to crush her opponent's spine was answered by rapidly-approaching howls.

 Lorelei Enos was in and out.
 One of the startling revelations found in these tapes is that Lorelei was with Buddy until the end.
 Rumors had her abandoning him after they had left Memphis for Los Angeles.
 Stories circulated back home about her, unflattering stories all, about her working in the pornographic film industry, about her fixing Buddy that final fix, about her leaving him for a slick-talking Hollywood casting agent.
 What is made clear here is her devotion to him and his to her.
 In this way they resemble John Lennon and Yoko Ono, another vastly misunderstood couple.

 Chapter 29 The dress hadn't entirely been real inside my mind.
 Even after Rachel finally admitted she'd purchased the dress from our Vegas trip, and had it sent here, it'd been hard to believe I was really going to be wearing it at the dance.
 It was hard to still be disbelieving when it was hanging from the door just a few feet from me, but I was giving the effort my best shot.
 Its green, silky beauty seemed to be mocking me.
 There was no way I was going to be able to pull off a dress like that.
 Even assuming it didn't fall off of me, I was still going to look like a walrus.
 "Stop fidgeting, Adri.
 It's just a dance, not a funeral, and if you don't hold still your makeup isn't going to turn out right."
 Rachel poked me in the ribs, and then went back to work on the last few details of my 'new and improved' look.

It seemed like a long time.
 Rick was in the hall waiting for her.
 She blushed when she looked into his eyes.
 She'd spent the previous evening cuddled up to him, returning the gentle kisses he'd kept raining on her lips.
 Rick had kissed her more times last night than Davis had the entire time they'd been together, and she couldn't look at him without thinking of those kisses.
 Silently Rick took her hand and led her downstairs.
 In the garden, he took her face between his hands, kissing her softly.
 "If you get home, I'll miss you."
 "I'll miss you too," she whispered, hugging him.
 She made herself focus her mind on her parents as she wandered through the garden.

They were the documents that they needed to cover their asses, period!
 Two nervous days passed before I got the go-ahead and a time and location for the drug deal.
 I was instructed to call Ashley and tell her the time but not to commit to the location.
 The police wanted the time to set up the area of the bust location and they did not want the drug dealer to come early and perhaps see them preparing.
 I was instructed to meet the police over an hour before the scheduled time.
 During this entire time since Brandon was busted, my wife and I had been working to detox him.
 We had him on complete lockdown at the house with no visitors allowed.

Can the political leadership of all countries seize this moment and convert it into an opportunity for promoting job-led economic growth, rooted in the principles of ecology and equity?
 Can we make the gender inequity and the coexistence of extreme poverty on the part of a billion children, women, and men, and extreme affluence and unsustainable lifestyles on the part of another billion, an anachronism of the past?
 Can we foster love of diversity and pluralism in terms of religion, race, language, colour or political belief?
 In our view, there are uncommon opportunities now to find the solutions to these basic challenges facing contemporary human society.
 We have tried to deal with them in a concise manner in this report, which concludes that commitment to the principles of democracy and human diversity, equity in terms of gender, economic condition and sustainable lifestyles, is fundamental to achieving both a better common present and a better future.
 Personally, it has been a privilege working with a highly distinguished group of women and men, whose sole concern has been a better life for all.
 I wish to thank every member of the Commission, as well as the many others who have helped us, for their time and vision.
 The Member Secretary, Mr Garry Jacobs, however, merits a special mention for his total dedication to the principles which inspired the setting up of ICPF.
 Throughout the last five years, he has devoted his time and extraordinary talent to the work of the Commission.
 He has been the principal catalyst of the Commission's work.

In order to document the potential for accelerated job growth, ICPF conducted a special country study of India in 1991 and drew up a strategy for creating 100 million jobs in the country within a decade.
 The strategy, which focused on utilizing agriculture and agri-business as engines to stimulate rural incomes and employment opportunities, was endorsed and adopted by the then Government of India, but not implemented for a variety of reasons.
 A review of this strategy one decade later indicates that the potential for achieving full employment in India is fully alive and the current Government‚Äôs commitment provides the right circumstances to achieve it in practice.
 This will also serve as an example and model for other countries to emulate.
 Backed by this commitment, the main elements of a successful employment strategy for India have been identified in a separate report prepared for the New Delhi meeting.
 The strategy focuses on giving an income and employment orientation to Indian agriculture, increased support for expansion of enterprises in the informal sector, broadening the on-going self-help group revolution and fully extending it to agricultural operations, upgradation and expansion of the country‚Äôs vocational training system, promotion of entrepreneurship and full utilization of information technology as a catalyst for development.
 Prospects and Emerging Opportunities
 Viewing the global employment situation as a whole, there are strong grounds for confidence in a brighter future.
 Resurgent Asia: The nations of East Asia, which went through rapid expansion followed by a major financial crisis, are back on the growth path.
 The Japanese economy is once again growing and creating new jobs, both at home and abroad, especially in China, which has become the largest destination for Japanese foreign investment and a key supplier base for Japanese manufactured goods.

 His grip had been rock-hard, but he hadn't actually squeezed enough to hurt me.

Cliff and I postponed our move to San Francisco and went looking for work, which we found at Coffee Dan's restaurant in Grossmont Center, a mall we could see from the front yard of my mom's hilltop home.
 I was a pot washer six days a week, a split shift, 10-2 and 6-10.
 Sundays and late evenings I played with Liz.
 Before work and between shifts, I carried on where Eric had left off reading dark novels.
 One of them was Crime and Punishment, by Fyodor Dostoyevski.
 The story tells of Raskolnikov, a dropped out university student a few years older than me, who is possessed with a deep bitterness because he is brilliant but also poor.
 Both to save his sister from marrying a wealthy snob and to prove a theory of his, he decides to rob a pawnbroker, knowing that the act might require murder.
 His theory maintains that even acts of violence can be justified for certain special people who intend to use the results of violence for the good of all or many.
 The special people, whose brilliance and high intentions exempted them from society's laws, were to me the same supermen Nietzsche urged us to become.
 The novel put me into a fever.

 Eric in a jock strap, beaming, his legs and arms spread as though to greet a familiar angel.
 Eric was superman.
 Strong, handsome, understanding, considerate, creative, vital, and brilliant.
 It was Eric who brought home Bertrand Russell‚Äôs Why I Am Not a Christian.
 My preferred reading was stories, but Eric wanted to commune with great thinkers and then talk about them, to explore ideas together, in hopes we might discover the meaning of life.
 As winter approached, we sat by the fireplace and took turns reading out loud.
 We admired Russell‚Äôs smug attitude, the gall of a fellow who accused Christ of utter arrogance for counting people vipers simply because they disapproved of his preaching.
 We delighted in Russell's arguments that Christianity was the principal enemy of moral progress in the world.

Wow, talk about a chauvinistic pig.
 It wasn't worth getting bent out of shape.
 I let my door swing shut, and walked over to Rachel's side so that I could see the entire parking lot.
 Empty as it was, it didn't take very long to realize Britney's little white Saturn was gone.
 "I thought you might still be here."
 The voice caught me by surprise.
 I probably would've jumped and screamed a little if I hadn't recognized it.
 Brandon was walking towards us with his characteristic casual stride, and I felt my heart speed up a little as I remembered our conversation from earlier in the day.

Jason turned in his sleep, mumbling something unintelligent.

 ‚ÄúWhat was the point of pushing me over, Jazell?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, it seemed better than punching you in the side.

 All through elementary school, she was always the smartest in class, and kinder than anybody else I knew.

Velixar pulled from within his cloak a chest the size of a small stone.
 He placed it on the grass where it shone gold in the light of the stars.
 As the two brothers watched, he whispered a few words of magic, enlarging the chest to normal size.
 ‚ÄúOver the centuries, I have gathered many items to aid those who would swear their lives to me,‚Äù Velixar said.
 The locks clicked open, the lid raised, and then he reached inside and pulled out two swords sheathed in gleaming obsidian.
 ‚ÄúThese swords were once wielded by Aerland Shen.
 He led the elves that aided Karak in the great war against Ashhur.
 When Celestia cursed his kind, they shared his curse.‚Äù Velixar smiled at Harruq, his eyes gleaming.

"For most of my life, there's been quite a bit riding on my ability to do so."
 Seeking to break the tension, I pointed to his phone.
 "You got a call too?"
 "Yes.
 I'm afraid something has come up.
 Will you be okay here for a few hours?"
 Normal human response was to make a little white lie, but I got the feeling I wouldn't be able to get away with lying to Alec.
 "I rather suspect whatever 'came up' is important enough I'll just have to be okay."
 He flinched a little, like maybe my aim had been a little too true.
 He looked for a moment like he was going to say something, but then his phone started vibrating again, and he simply nodded as he turned and walked away, moving much faster by himself than he did when I was with him.

I managed to restrain myself, just barely, only to giggle as Rachel dropped her lunch and squealed for me.
 Dominic's gentle smile wasn't quite as enthusiastic, but I already knew her subdued reaction wasn't any less heartfelt.
 Throw in Jasmin's congratulations, which seemed to indicate the passing grade had been nothing less than inevitable, with Alec taking my hand as soon as I sat down, and Jessica and James' lack of response didn't matter at all.
 With Isaac's reassuring presence at my side in History, I weathered the renewed gossip, apparently occasioned by the entire pack's absence during lunch for the second day in a row, and soon found myself reunited with Alec in Physics.
 As luck would have it, Mrs. Alexander was gone again, and the substitute was typically clueless about what we were supposed to be doing.
 Alec of course spent the whole class unearthing other little bits of embarrassing information.
 I'd never experienced anything like it, every question I answered spawned two more, and he invariably seemed to figure out the underlying reasons I'd done a given thing, or reacted a certain way.
 I'd just finished describing my failed tryout for the school's production of¬†To Kill a Mockingbird, when he hit me with a completely unexpected question.
 "So tell me about both your best date and your worst date before you came here."

I tried to inject the proper amount of blonde stupidity into my words, but wasn't sure it worked until I felt Alec's arms tighten almost painfully around me.
 I gasped, and he set me down so quickly I almost fell over.
 Before I'd even regained my balance, he was walking away, moving so quickly I would've needed to run to keep up.
 Even so, he hadn't turned away quick enough to hide the complete disdain in his expression.
 I suddenly found myself wishing I'd told him the truth rather than making him think I was stupid and manipulative.
 It was too late.
 He was already out of sight, and by now his opinion of me was fixed.
 Chapter 4 School hadn't gotten any worse after I'd convinced the hottest boy on the planet that I was a complete waste of oxygen, but it hadn't gotten any better either.
 Mrs. Tiggs, my Spanish teacher, had seemed every bit as mean as my Biology teacher from earlier in the day, and it had been a relief when Britney had finally dropped me off at home.
 I watched Britney's little white Saturn disappear down the lane with a complex set of feelings that included a bit of loneliness and more than a little relief.

Over the last few years, his right knee acted up whenever he mounted stairs.
 That, of course, was just one of many complaints advanced years bestowed upon him.
 How ironic that the young prisoners were on their way to die, when old useless men like him, and scumbag fellow guards, continued to live.
 He suppressed a shiver of excitement at the notion that this time will be different.
 This time, he would not just cry out to the gods about the injustice while innocent people burned.
 He filled his lungs with stale air tainted with burning pitch and tried to sink into the mindless guard mentality that kept him functioning for the past decade and a half.
 Once a man loses all hope of a decent life, it is astonishing what he will do to stay alive.
 For the last twenty years his following orders and doing his duty, along with his better than average training for a guard, had served him well.
 He had been safe from the bounty on his head and for the most part.
 His life was more boring than anything else.

I vaguely remember the baseball diamond.
 I remember comparing peepees with the girl down the street;  I even remember her name (well, of course I do, my first sex) which was Sandy.
 I remember, as if from a bad dream, a life lesson dream) getting a hellacious shock from our electric football game.
 This was a flat metal gameboard which you plugged into the wall and it vibrated and your defensive and offensive formations danced together (or apart) in random, chaotic tremblings, until the player with the ball (a small plastic chip) was shaken off the playing field.
 I think I piled rubber bricks on the game (although rubber shouldn't give you a shock, should it?)
 and was jolted into an acute awareness, which obviously left its impression.
 I believe this is my clearest memory of Lewiston:  a healthy dose of 120 volts.
 Is this what you want?

 His opponent flew out of the saddle, an ungainly sight, and landed hard on the arena floor.

 Rodregas headed back to Doi‚Äôvan who said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that technique is what the knights had in mind.‚Äù His voice showed his personal pleasure, knowing that a move he had taught Rodregas lead to his victory.
 Rodregas nodded and said, ‚ÄúDecided that my advantage of strength was being matched by armor and steed, so it was time to use agility.
 I was not sure it would work.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt will be harder the next time.
 Good luck,‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan said.
 Rodregas‚Äô next opponent for the joust was riding a powerful war steed and was in the dark non-reflective brown of full Night Bronze armor.

The controversy over the relationship between culture and development is complicated by the fact that development both creates and destroys cultural forms and values.
 Every developmental achievement results in an abandonment of old behaviours and attitudes, and the acceptance of new ones.
 Development destroys survival-based, traditional values and creates achievement-oriented, progressive values.
 Over the last two centuries in countries around the world development has strengthened expansive values that encourage greater freedom, tolerance, individual initiative, self-confidence and self-respect, dynamism, risk-taking, efficiency, punctuality, organization, communication and cooperation, open-mindedness and respect for new ideas, innovation and creativity.
 At the same time development has weakened values that support respect for tradition and hierarchy, seniority and authority, self-effacement and humility, patience and perseverance, generosity and self-sacrifice.
 The nineteenth century tolerated values based on the exploitation by people over people through slavery, colonialism and war, and the domination of nature by man.
 The guiding values for the coming century are freedom and respect for the individual, social equity, tolerance of human diversity and harmony with the environment.
 Development is widely regarded as the cause of moral decline and increasing corruption, crime and violence.
 These negative consequences are primarily due to the fact that freedom has been extended to vast sections of the population which were confined in the past by rigid social barriers and minimum expectations, so they never had need or occasion to embrace the values they now eschew.
 The earlier self-restraint has been replaced by a self-assertion that has not yet acquired the productive values needed for achievement.

Throughout their childhoods, we‚Äôve had a good life and a beautiful home, nice cars, good communities, and the best of schools.
 I encouraged their interests by making sure they had the equipment they needed to pursue them.
 For instance, when Brandon showed a real interest in and talent for photography, he received his dream camera for Christmas.
 I have loved my wife and I have shown my children that I love them.
 The boys have witnessed firsthand what a healthy spousal relationship is and that was something I never saw in my childhood home.
 I always believed in teaching my children to respect all people in all walks of life.
 On the holidays I sent my boys out to give freshly baked cookies to the people who collected our garbage.
 I taught the boys how to care for our yard, mowing and edging, and they had household responsibilities and chores (and I never sprayed them with a hose nozzle, at least not to compel yard work).
 I believed they needed to learn good strong work ethics.

Born in a matter of minutes, so fast the nurses were dubious, the doctor almost late.
 The town was Lewiston, New York, a carbuncle on the gritty side of gritty Niagara Falls, New York, the former honeymoon capital of the United States, a country which, like Niagara Falls in microcosm, had lately fallen into disrepair.
 Now, Niagara Falls, Ontario, just over the national border, where my mother's incredibly large family hailed from, was bright and brisk and clean and gardeny, the shiny flipside of its American counterpart.
 I‚Äôve seen the great falls frozen; I‚Äôve seen it turned off as if there were a giant tap.
 I‚Äôve stood on a rocking boat deck beneath its monstrous incontestableness.
 Where I was born is a grey little town, a pustule on the side of grey little Niagara New York.
 The Canadian side had the greener grass, we all knew, even as late at night, in our trundle beds, we felt the thrum in our veins of a power larger than kings, a warbling of just what the earth has in mind, though it stayed, of course, just beyond us.
 I longed to be from the Canadian side; I longed to be Canadian.
 I thought my mother's family was just about the most exotic thing I could imagine (and later in school I used her heritage as if it were some bizarre ethnic upbringing, as if one side of my family tree was hung with Hottentots, or Eskimos), and my Canuck uncles, who were all big, strapping, lumberjack men, who could hold seven or eight nieces and nephews on their backs, were the ideal of manhood with which I constantly compared my scrawny, allergic, weak wristed self (No upper body strength, my tennis coach would later tell me).
 Actually I have few memories from Lewiston.

 I wasn‚Äôt about to try to build one on my own and risk embarrassing myself in front of Chevelle.
 A gust of wind pushed the flames beneath the spit, causing them to writhe and jump.
 They formed shapes that pulled at my memories.

She gave him a quick smile before slipping into her room.
 Rick's smile had become a frown by the time he was in his own room.
 He wasn't sure this trip was such a good idea after all.
 Sharing her dream was going to make him fall even more deeply in love with her.
 And when she left, he'd be devastated.
 But remembering the excitement on her face as she'd danced with the actor, he couldn't regret it.

 It felt disloyal to Alec but I had to know.

 It was not in great shape, but it was whole.
 Rodregas watched a few of the other matches before it was his turn again.

I wanted to just collapse and let unconsciousness overcome me, but something pulled me onward towards the next series of pictures, and then the next after that.
 I wanted to stop.
 Each piece opened up another fragment of my soul, revealing a new pain that I'd kept hidden for the last few months.
 The last picture was next to a door, which I opened almost without realizing I was doing so.
 The organized confusion of a true artist met my gaze.
 I'd seen it with my mom, when she was so driven to complete a shot that she couldn't be bothered to clean up after herself.
 She left just enough structure to the mess to find needed tools, but didn't waste any effort on anything that wouldn't help her with her great aim.
 Brushes were scattered everywhere, old and new canvases stacked in the corners of the studio, and flecks of paint had found their way onto almost every visible surface.
 The rich smell of paint was nearly overpowering, but I noticed it only in passing as I made a beeline towards the easel that dominated the center of the space.
 The painting was still wet, right down to the signature which had been done in the palest green.

 I was relaxing so quickly that I wasn't sure how much longer I would be able to stay awake, but his story was already different than any other I'd heard, and I resolved I wasn't going to miss any of it.
 As long as he was willing to talk I was going to fight off sleep.
 "Something happened though to break the bonds between the Sun and the Earth.
 Some say the Earth insulted the Sun, who is incredibly vain.
 Others believe the Sun's children marred the face of the Earth, and that when she refused to discipline her wayward family, the Earth swore in his wrath to destroy them."
 Alec adjusted his pillow and continued.
 "Whatever the cause, it's commonly held that this was the point at which the Earth ceased to be a paradise.

I was careful anyway, pretending to lie down and placing the book where I could quickly cover it if I were caught.
 I ran my fingers over the dark leather cover, tracing the scripted V etched there.

 I sighed.

However, preservation of physical security against external aggression is a primal instinct of nation states that cannot be rationalized away.
 Nations will continue to arm themselves as long as that is the only effective means to ensure their security.
 What is needed is a quantum shift from the competitive security paradigm to a cooperative security system in which countries mutually and collectively agree to refrain from acts of aggression and to protect each other from such acts by any nation.
 This principle served to protect the NATO and Warsaw Pact countries in the past, but on an exclusive basis which promoted a polarization of alliances into military blocs and, most importantly, left more than one hundred countries outside the security orbit and vulnerable to proxy wars.
 It should now be restructured on a global basis as a collective security system that offers protection to all nations from external aggression.
 A whole range of new security challenges is rising to confront the global society.
 The increasing number, complexity and unpredictability of security threats cannot be managed effectively and in time without international cooperation based on a fundamental change of attitude.
 We are now at an historic crossroads: one path leads us back to a static, unstable and exclusive competitive security paradigm; the other leads to a far more stable and dynamic cooperative security paradigm inclusive of all nations and responsive to future needs and challenges.
 A global cooperative security system is needed that seeks to strengthen national security without increasing the insecurity of other states.
 It should be based on the fundamental principle that force will no longer be tolerated by the international community as a legitimate instrument of national policy.

orm of security that92m is0m entirely92m based0m92m from0m physical security is the right of insecure states to protect their lives, rights92m and0m sovereignty.

My mother has been through too much pain and I can‚Äôt imagine what affect it would have on her to visit another family member in jail if things go badly tonight.
 I think about the deep secret I have now and what my mother would think, and those defining moments that led me here.
 Chapter 2: Small Town Whispers Sometimes life‚Äôs secrets begin with life itself.
 My mother discovered she was pregnant with my older brother Thomas while she was still a high school student in a tiny town in Kansas.
 To this day the town still has brick streets and tiny homes that are a throwback to simpler times.
 The town is so small that the phonebook is about the size of a comic book.
 It was 1957 and she was impregnated by her boyfriend in the back seat of his parents‚Äô car.
 My mother and father decided to sneak out to a neighboring town and get married after they discovered her pregnancy.
 After their wedding, they returned to their respective homes each night, keeping their secret.
 They did not know how or when they would break the news to their families.

 She showered while Rick did the same in his bathroom, and she washed her hair with some shampoo she found on the edge of the tub.
 It smelled nice, and she found herself wishing for some perfume or some bath oil.
 She should have thought of that yesterday.
 After toweling her hair dry, she combed it, bound her chest, and put on the blue-green blouse and her jeans.
 Rick was coming down the hall as she emerged from the bathroom.
 "Hi--feel better?"
 She nodded.

Or if you'd rather, I can show you to the theater."
 I chopped off a hysterical burst of laughter just before it managed to emerge full force and totally embarrass me.
 Of course Alec had a theater in his house.
 Probably a pool and a gym too.
 Along with a half-dozen other amenities I'd never think of, but that the ultra-rich simply couldn't do without.
 I pulled my erratic, pointless thoughts back into a compact, nearly sensible ball, and shook my head as I did my best to give him a genuine smile.
 "No thanks.
 I probably won't be hungry for several hours still.
 Is there a library in the house perhaps?"
 Donovan's smile had a surprising touch of mischief to it.

"Those of us who don't require normal amounts of sleep have all been up for quite some time, with the exception of Master Alec, who remained abed for an uncharacteristic length of time, but the rest of the house is just now waking.
 In fact I rather suspect you have just enough time to shower and eat before Mistress Rachel will be pounding on the door, as it were, in excitement for your upcoming trip into town."
 A groan escaped me despite my best efforts.
 Donovan was too polite to ask outright, but I had to respond to his raised eyebrow or he might think I didn't want to talk to Rachel.
 "I'm sorry, Donovan, it's just that I¬†really¬†hate shopping."
 "Ah, yes.
 Might I suggest that possibly is due to the fact you've never pursued the activity in the right company?"
 ** Right company indeed.
 I'd expected it would just be Rachel and I, and that we'd make a quick run in to Sanctuary, which seemed silly seeing as how my house was just as close as town was.

And I discovered the best I could do to relieve depression was turn my thoughts and concerns from myself to others.
 Even the feeling like a rock in my belly went away.
 Love heals.
 Along with The Practice of the Presence of God and some mysteries, I have been reading about Feodor Dostoyevski's philosophical positions, because the issues he tackled a century and a half ago are still remarkably current.
 In Dostoyevski the Thinker, I discovered a passage written following the death of his first wife.
 Since I have the book with me, I pull into a turnout overlooking the Pacific, find the passage and reread it.
 "To love someone as oneself, in accordance with Christ's commandment, is impossible.
 The love of personality is binding on earth.
 The self stands in the way.
 Christ could do it, but Christ was an eternal ideal, toward which man strives and must strive, by the law of nature.

I hesitantly returned Rachel's tentative smile, and then dug into my homework.
 Mrs. Campbell stopped by for a few minutes, obviously checking to make sure that I was over my aberrant behavior from yesterday.
 I got the feeling she would've liked to chat for a bit longer, but we had the predictable surge in attendance given the coming test.
 I gave her my best reassuring smile as she left, and then watched as she and the other tutors all bounced from one student to the next answering questions.
 As much as I would have liked to just call it a day, another good effort added to what I'd done earlier would put me two or maybe even three days ahead of my personal schedule.
 With a sigh of resignation I found my place on the page again, and started sorting out another set of variables.
 Forty-five minutes later I'd nearly completed another two sections, and was more than ready for a breather.
 Sometime while I'd been studying, most of the kids had left.
 I hadn't expected all of them to stay until my shift started, but I'd expected more than the two or three I usually had.
 Only it didn't look like that was going to be the case.

Britney was still looking longingly at a pile of fries.
 When I looked up again Brandon was looking back at me with a smile that communicated all kinds of things I'd always thought you needed words for.
 His expression seemed to say he was glad to see me, embarrassed to be the center of attention, and sorry he couldn't get away from his friends to come over and say hi.
 I felt my face go hot with embarrassment.
 I tried to step behind a pillar before he saw me go bright red, but knew I hadn't succeeded.
 I bit my lip as I realized how spastic I was being.
 I'd spent the last sixteen-plus years suppressing my natural tendency to form crushes on one cute boy after another.
 I'd nearly perfected the art of exhibiting zero interest in the opposite sex.
 The whole point of my existence had been avoiding the kinds of things that'd result in everyone laughing at me.
 Why was I setting my sights on a boy who was so far out of my league?

 He was still smiling as he hung up.

Plenty of time to get you straightened back out.‚Äù She stood and walked to the front wall.
 I hadn‚Äôt noticed the narrow window before, no wider than the flat of a hand.
 Ruby positioned herself in front of it, watching whatever was outside.
 I sighed.
 Plenty of time.
 I fiddled with the blankets for a few minutes, tried a couple of times‚Äîfutilely‚Äîto move tiny specks of loose rock on the floor, and then gave up and decided to read the journal again.
 I rolled away from Ruby and pulled my pack into the curve of my body, settling the book open but able to be quickly hidden away.

And she loved it.
 She didn't have to trick him into holding her, didn't have to dance with him to get his arms around her.
 He liked holding her.
 And he'd been home at 5:30 every day, just as he'd promised--just because he wanted to be with her.
 Davis had never rearranged his schedule for her.
 Rick spent every moment of every evening with her.
 He'd even refused to play racquetball tomorrow with a friend who called last night because he wanted to spend both Saturday and Sunday with her.
 Marie blinked back tears of confusion.
 She was betrothed to Davis.

Rachel patted my hand.
 "Brandon's lies are so convincing precisely because he's so careful to mix a healthy serving of truth in there to go along with the false.
 She's liked Ben for almost as long as I can remember.
 I think it all started when they both ended up at the school nurse together with broken bones due to 'falling down the stairs.'"
 I felt a shiver course through me at the thought of what Rachel was implying.
 Watching Jasmin twirl through moves that seemed to be a modification of East Coast Swing, it was hard to believe anyone so self-possessed could've had that kind of childhood.
 I thought about asking for more details, but it felt wrong, like reading someone else's e-mail.
 Besides, I was pretty sure Rachel would tell me it was Jasmin's story, and I'd just have to go to her with my questions.
 The music picked up slightly, and Jasmin and Alec sped up with it.

 The words weren't anything special, but there was something about the way he said them that made me absolutely sure he'd deliver on his promise, that he was somehow completely in control of his surroundings.
 The intensity in his stare was too much, and I found myself looking away, trying to buy some time to collect myself.
 Luckily I wasn't so far gone as to not recognize where we were.
 "Oh, gosh, that was the turnoff to my house.
 I'm so sorry."
 Brandon flashed me another smile and quickly maneuvered his car through a U-turn, a feat I was fairly certain was harder than it looked in the bulky muscle car.

He wanted sympathy, but he knew that the straight talking Doi‚Äôvan was not likely to give him any.
 ‚ÄúI know.

 ‚ÄúNone of us is simple,‚Äù continued the Hellborn.
 ‚ÄúThe two of us have become friends, even though I am a Hellborn.
 In me flows the blood of the Daemons of the Infernal.‚Äù He paused and then his voice cracked, showing a trace of a deep emotion for the first time ‚ÄúYet, you treat me like a man.
 You must do the same for Imeralda, for you two to be lovers you must learn to share her with others.
 She has a lot of love to give.
 Do not be so selfish as to want it all to yourself.‚Äù With that he gave a punch to Rodregas‚Äô side, causing Rodregas to grunt in pain, and Doi‚Äôvan followed the other two out the door.

The sight was so incredibly beautiful it took me several moments to realize the tendril was the waterfall I'd been looking for.
 I reached into the dancing pool of light at my feet and smiled as my cupped hands came away filled with water that lit up my palms.
 I couldn't imagine anything more surreal.
 I might have stayed there for hours if the barest whisper of sound hadn't distracted me.
 Alec was staring at me, an expression of disapproval marring otherwise perfect features.
 "Of all the places for you to intrude, why did it have to be here?"
 For a second, surrounded as I was by such beauty, I did feel like an intruder.
 He was gorgeous, and his tan skin seemed to have the slightest hint of light playing beneath its surface.

At the invitation of the Soviet Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Commission's next meeting, in November 1990, was held in Moscow: it would examine the challenges facing the USSR during the shift to democracy and a civilian market economy, and identify steps to improve the food supply, speed military conversion and ease the economic transition.
 The immediate euphoria over the rapid reduction in tensions between East and West freed public attention to focus on other pressing problems and generated great expectations that a 'peace dividend' would usher in a period of rapid economic progress for developing countries.
 Yet, despite a remarkable one-third reduction in worldwide defence spending from peak levels in the 1980s, foreign aid budgets continued to shrink.
 This prompted us to examine the potential benefits that could be derived from transferring or redirecting scientific, technological, educational and productive resources from military applications to support development and the environment.
 At the same time, increasing pressure was mounted by donors on aid-dependent developing countries to reduce their own defence spending, often with out consideration for the genuine security concerns of these countries.
 The need to improve mechanisms to protect all nations from external aggression has stimulated a rethinking of the competitive security paradigm which has governed relations between nations throughout the century, and the formulation of an alternative approach.
 The slow expansion of world trade and economic growth in developing countries during this period, attributable to prolonged recession in industrialized nations and a drastic decline in demand from Eastern Europe, underlined the need for more effective and better-coordinated development strategies to address the problems of the world's one billion people who live in hunger and absolute poverty.
 Increasing the production and availability of food to meet the nutritional needs of a still rapidly expanding global population led us to propose steps to double food production in deficit regions.
 In many countries, the problem of hunger has less to do with insufficient food production than with distribution or entitlement.
 The poor lack remunerative employment opportunities to generate the purchasing power needed to obtain the minimum essential requirements of food.

overnment aid provides significant technical benefits to farmers as a primary source from income; while the92m United0m States often does have a market for African-92mflagged0m agricultural products, this is often hampered by the lack of research in some92m of0m its most promising fields.

I was given the grand tour and a detailed break down of how each different bud worked better for different symptoms.
 This one is for sleeplessness, this one for appetite stimulation, this one for back pain, and this one‚Äîbelieve it or not‚Äî is for asthma.
 It was absurd.
 I know there are people out there who claim they need this drug, but those people were not my son or half of the high school, nor did anyone at this dispensary seem to be suffering from anything but red squinty eyes.
 But, we thought, at least our son is only smoking legal pot.
 I did it, and I‚Äôm okay.
 As time went on Brandon was showing signs that he was faltering.
 I busted him again.
 Then, he began to collect speeding tickets, show up to work on the Chevelle apparently inebriated, fight with his brother, be non-participatory in the family.

Not after everything else he'd already done for me.
 Guilting him into helping me more just felt wrong.
 He captured me in his iron grip, stopping me from getting up and running away.
 "Adriana Paige, it isn't that I don't want to be with you.
 I want it more than anything else right now.
 That's¬†why I'm not sure it's such a good idea."
 His face had somehow gotten so close to mine that I could see his eyes, and they were dead serious.
 I'd never noticed how clear his eyes were.
 They were the purest blue I'd ever seen, and looking into them was like trying to plumb the depths of a bottomless spring.
 I could see further into him than I ever could with Brandon, and there wasn't any deception there.

The halls had emptied remarkably fast, especially considering how much gossip there was for the rumor mill.
 It was almost like some primitive survival instinct had kicked in and steered everyone away from ground zero.
 With the two of them so much closer, I could feel their energy beating at Jasmin and me.
 It was all I could do now to remain motionless as they entered what even I knew was striking range of Jasmin.

When he really pushed the issue, his house mysteriously caught on fire."
 My mouth was hanging open, but Britney seemed to think it was disbelief rather than amazement.
 "I'm serious, Adriana, and I'm not letting you take my family down with you.
 Find your own way home."
 Chapter 6 There was no reason for Britney's actions to come as any kind of surprise, it was exactly in keeping with her character.
 Even if she didn't believe a word of what she'd just told me, I really was on my way to becoming a social pariah, and her whole existence centered around becoming more popular.
 Even so, knowing I was officially stranded at school with no way home felt very much like the end of the world.
 We still didn't have a phone, and probably wouldn't for weeks to come, even assuming we somehow managed to keep our home through the end of the week.

Neither the victor nor the victim can any longer afford to resolve conflicts violently.
 Political states may still be able to survive wars, but developmental achievements can not.
 So long as the benefits of development are confined to one or a few sections of society, the costs of militarization and war may not prevent economic and social progress.
 But when the need is to fulfil the rising expectations of the masses by extending the benefits of development to the entire society ‚Äì thus enabling the society as a whole to move to the next higher level of collective affluence and fulfilment ‚Äì every social resource must be garnered and harnessed for this purpose.
 The colossal cost of armaments and the catastrophic destruction of war are incompatible with the achievement of prosperity for all.
 Peace has become the fundamental imperative for development.
 War as an Instrument of Policy
 Humanity has lived with war for so many millennia that it is difficult to imagine a world without it.
 Even in the four decades of ‚Äòpeace‚Äô following the Second World War, approximately 160 inter-state and intra-state wars, including 100 major conflicts, have been fought in developing countries, leading directly to 20 million deaths ‚Äì half of them caused by the armed forces of developed countries in Korea, Indochina, Algeria and other anti-colonial wars ‚Äì and to another 20 million war-related casualties.
 These massive casualties during a time of ‚Äòpeace‚Äô are roughly equal to the total casualties incurred by all the countries of the world during the last world war.

‚ÄúOld family recipe, you see.
 My mother left a diary.‚Äù She was thoughtful for a moment.
 ‚ÄúAh, what a thing, a mother‚Äôs diary.‚Äù Ruby went silent for too long and I wondered if she would be returning to this one-sided conversation any time soon.
 Her eyes flicked back to me.
 ‚ÄúIt was very fortunate for me she‚Äôd kept a journal, you see, for I would have no fairy knowledge without it.‚Äù I felt my brows draw together and tried to smooth my face.
 ‚ÄúNo, don‚Äôt feel bad for me.

 Not that she‚Äôd given me much opportunity.
 I contemplated whether this was her usual behavior toward strangers or if she felt we had a special motherless bond.
 She ran her finger through the substance in the canister and it came out coated in a deep, dark green that had the consistency of grease, which she smeared across the base of my eyelid.

Halfway through the walk to my normal table I looked up and saw Rachel smiling at me with almost the exact same innocent, convincing smile her brother had used on me just a couple of hours before.
 My insides simultaneously tensed up with hurt and relaxed in happiness.
 The best I could really have expected out of the experience would have been to stay on an even keel, but instead it was almost as if part of my frustration evaporated.
 I still wasn't ready to get up and sing any songs, but it was starting to at least look like I might manage to finish out the day.
 Especially surprising considering my current mental state, it only took me half an hour to finish up the two Algebra sections I'd assigned myself.
 Mrs. Campbell stopped by my desk a few seconds after I finished up.
 "We don't really need the extra help until later.

Measures of the gap between the prevailing levels of nutrition in developing countries and the levels achieved in the West reveal a huge potential for increasing demand for agricultural production, which can serve as an engine to drive the growth of the world economy.
 Extrapolation from ICPF‚Äôs studies of the employment potential of expanding agricultural production in India suggests that more than one billion jobs can be created worldwide through a strategy that focuses on raising agricultural productivity as an engine for improving diets, employment and industrialization.
 Challenges in Agriculture
 The ratio of growth of foodgrain production to population growth has entered into a period of decline over the past decade ‚Äì increasing at just one per cent per year compared to three per cent during the previous two decades.
 There is a similar trend for other staple crops and meat.
 For fish, there has actually been a net decline of seven per cent in per capita world production.
 To a large extent, this slowdown is the result of slower growth in demand, especially in industrial countries, under lining the fact that food security is predominantly an economic problem rather than a technological one.
 But the decline in the growth of global agricultural productivity over the past decade is also attributable to a variety of political, economic and environmental factors.
 Political priority
 After the Second World War, developing countries that had suffered from recurring famine in early periods struggled to increase food production as an urgent national priority to keep up with surging population growth and spiralling demand for food.

Let's just say Rachel would be missed if we hit another car, but nobody would need to miss me."
 The answer was like something you'd expect from a politician.
 It conveyed absolutely no information, and his supreme confidence was infuriating.
 Luckily, I wouldn't have to hold my tongue for very long.
 We were already gliding around the last bend in the road before our lane.
 I expected Alec to slow to a stop and make me walk like James had.
 He slowed, but just enough to make the turn down the dusty lane.

Could it be that Davis‚Äô job was harder than Rick‚Äôs?
 No‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt just that Rick didn‚Äôt spend half the evening at his office.
 He‚Äôd even chosen to be with her rather than with a girl he‚Äôd known longer than he had her, a girl from his own decade.
 Confusing thoughts and feelings kept her from being able to fall asleep quickly that night.
 She'd had so much fun this week, watching pictures and using the microwave oven and wearing blue jeans, but she missed her parents and her brother and Tom and Davis.
 They had to be out of their minds with worry and grief.
 They probably thought she'd been kidnapped.

I managed to snap my slack jaw shut at the same moment I realized I had angled my body toward him when he‚Äôd addressed me.
 I mentally cursed, but I could recover this; I would just keep going in the same direction as if I were on my way to town, because I was on my way to town.
 There was no need for him to know it was to research someone associated with the Council.
 Someone like him.
 I tried to respond to his greeting, but felt choked and instead only nodded back, my mouth tight as I endeavored to grin with a now clenched jaw.
 I groaned internally, keeping on the path, not daring to look back in case he was behind me.
 I was convinced he was.
 He wouldn‚Äôt be taking the back way to Junnie‚Äôs as I had come, and he wouldn‚Äôt be leaving the village without a pack; he was likely going to a Council meeting.
 Yes, he was certainly right behind me, following me into town.

Once we got to school, I'd found the rampant gossip had subsided to a dull rumble, but the few undecided votes had come down solidly on the side of everyone else.
 Some people hated me for using Brandon, others hated me for playing Alec, while a small, but decidedly upwardly-mobile group disliked me for achieving not just one, but both of the conquests they'd been dreaming of since grade school.
 In the end, it didn't really matter why everyone disliked me.
 Still, only the fact that Alec's pack closed ranks around me kept the situation from becoming unbearable.
 Biology went better than it had since my first day in Sanctuary, largely because Alec seemed to have developed a postdoctorate knowledge of Biology.
 Also he didn't have a single qualm when it came to using that knowledge to deflect questions aimed at me.
 Mrs. Sorenson tried three different times to make me look stupid before finally giving up and getting down to the business of teaching.
 She continued to shoot us nasty looks throughout the class, but I hardly noticed.
 Alec spent the rest of the class time writing questions for me in the margins of my notebook.
 By the time I'd described my grandparents, kindergarten teacher, and top three most embarrassing moments, I wanted to get a chance to ask some questions of my own, but he just shook his head and passed me my notebook back with a new set of quickly-jotted queries.

Therefore, co ordination of policies is in the interests of the global community.
 A comprehensive and coordinated international effort is called for to improve the global climate for economic growth and job creation by evolving stable and supportive policies to regulate capital flows, foreign trade, debt, commodity pricing, immigration and labour movements, transfer of technology, investment, military spending and the arms trade.
 We set forth below a broad policy framework to stimulate global job growth with the aim of achieving full employment early in the twenty-first century.
 1.World Employment Programme: Raising incomes and creating jobs in the developing countries is the best way to promote global economic growth and employment generation in the coming decades.
 The World Summit on Social Development should call for a comprehensive World Employment Programme to stimulate more rapid growth in developing countries as an engine for global economic expansion.
 The International Labour Organization has operated a programme for the past two decades, but solution of the employment problem requires an integrated approach that transcends the scope of any single international agency.
 The programme should establish specific objectives and co ordinate efforts to stimulate international investment, increase labour market flexibility, promote productive skills, diffuse technology, eliminate protectionist trade policies that retard growth, increase trade between developing countries, and promote international cooperation on taxation systems to encourage more labour-oriented tax codes.
 2.Coordination of macro-economic policies: The efforts of the industrial nations to achieve higher rates of economic growth and job creation are stymied by the need to maintain macro-economic stability at the same time.
 Due to the competition between OECD members to attract financial resources, rising interest rates or falling inflation rates in one country influence the inflow and outflow of financial resources from other members of the community.
 The efforts to curb inflation at the expense of slower economic growth and job creation need not be so rigorous, if OECD members more closely coordinated their policies to support macro-economic expansion.

 annual budget deficit and new rules92m 20100m would allow OECD members like Japan, only a relatively pactive OECD member, to succeed in its challenge under92m right0m economic circumstances. In92m developing0m nations like the Korea, the92m chronic0m poverty bottleneck is likely to undermine the likelihood92m of0m developing macro-economic confidence to promote such new medium

He had been clean for six years, and I could only pray for the same result.
 He had worked there since he graduated the program and he assured me they would do their best to help Brandon.
 The facility where Brandon was staying was nearly a nine-hour drive from our home.
 We talked to Brandon on the phone occasionally and every time we did it was as if a cloud was slowly lifting and he was starting to think more clearly.
 He seemed to be growing up.
 He had never really matured like his younger brother because in his world of drugs he was not living reality.
 Easter was rolling around and we planned on visiting him with the family, but only if he completed certain parts of his program by Easter.
 If so, he would be allowed a LOA (Leave Of Absence) for the day.
 If not, we would have Easter with him at the facility.
 He would have been an inpatient for over two months by then, and the Narconon program would keep him as long as they needed until he was ready to graduate or until he left on his own.

‚ÄúThey are beautiful.‚Äù She smiled but at her words Doi‚Äôvan clearly did not see beautiful animals but a problem.
 ‚ÄúShe is correct; most have trained war horses and a few are Dire Steeds.
 I will be honest Rodregas, I am not sure that this will work.
 These warriors are trained in the use of the lance and their war horses will negate your personal advantage in physical might, as your horse is a trail mount.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan paused and said, ‚ÄúBut, the real problem is that you are without plate armor.
 I am not sure how you can survive such a competition.
 The competition with mace or hammer will be only marginally better for you.

It had been widely anticipated by foreign experts that this strategy would result in an immediate run on the country's foreign reserves and thereby a collapse of the new currency's foundation.
 Contrary to expectations, the initial months of the programme have yielded spectacular results.
 Inflation fell to zero per cent in the first week after the issue of the new currency and remained below one per cent during the first five months.
 Instead of a massive outflow of foreign currency through conversion of superdinars, people have rushed to cash in their foreign currency, resulting in a 60 per cent increase in the nation's reserves during the first three months.
 One of the most significant features of the programme has been its fair distribution of benefits and low social cost to the population.
 In contrast with the widespread outrage felt by Russian citizens over repeated episodes of demonetization and confiscation of household savings, the Yugoslav people have enthusiastically accepted the new currency as representative of a new deal for the poor and the working class.
 In addition, instead of the severe contraction of output experienced elsewhere, production rose by more than 100 per cent during the first five months, stimulating an increase in employment and demand for new investment.
 Real tax revenues have increased significantly.
 The astonishing initial success of the programme can be attributed to its balance and comprehensiveness, and to the following specific features: the government's recognition that stabilization was absolutely essential to economic recovery; the widespread public support for the programme, which was in large part due to the efforts to protect weaker sections from its harshest effects; the simultaneous relaxation of controls on industry; support for a natural rather than a forced process of privatization, based on the specific circumstances of each firm rather than on ideology; continued price supports for agriculture and a minimum wage for labour, which are crucial for maintaining food supplies and social stability; and rejection of import liberalization in order to protect domestic manufacturing against a major shock during the initial period of recovery.
 Possibly the greatest strength of the Yugoslav programme is that it was of necessity conceived by people within the country rather than by foreign experts, and depended entirely on domestic resources and capabilities for its accomplishment, rather than on pleas for foreign assistance.

In Eastern Europe, where a peaceful revolution from within has broken the shackles of statism that long confined the energies of people, these energies now surge forward in high and eager expectations of a better life.
 Already there are growing signs of impatience, disappointment and frustration arising from the greater hardships that have come in place of the greater benefits that all expected.
 It is essential that these energies be channelled into constructive pursuits that generate tangible improvements.
 Otherwise they may recoil from the effort and look backwards to a failed system or be guided by false prophets on a path that once again poses a threat to other nations.
 The phenomenon of growing violence in an age of increasing affluence seems to contradict the thesis that poverty is one of the major causes of violence, until we realize that the increasingly visible signs of prosperity the world over raise the expectations and aggravate the sense of deprivation and revolt among those that have been by-passed by the general progress.
 Greater political and social freedom can only further magnify this tendency.
 This suggests that violence at the international, national and community levels cannot and will not be eradicated before poverty itself has been abolished, and that, if poverty is left unaddressed at its source, further economic progress is likely further to aggravate conflict in society, unless we are able to extend the benefits of progress to everyone.
 This realization would be quite disconcerting were it not for the fact that we are fast approaching the time when both these persistent ills of humankind can be banished forever ‚Äì the way slavery and colonialism were banished in the past.
 The recognition that it is neither desirable nor possible to go backwards adds urgency to our efforts to move forward.
 Revolutions of the past have been partial and localized negative reactions against an existing social order, and benefited only a small part of society that, in turn, blindly resisted change.

 ‚ÄúWe were in need of shelter after your‚Ä¶ episode.
 It was close enough to work.

I threw him into his own consuming flames.
 The other two I did not meet until afterwards.‚Äù At Rodregas‚Äô response Van‚Äôdret stared at him, ‚ÄúYou killed an Immortalist Sorcerer by yourself in his tower?

 He did chuckle a bit as he said, ‚ÄúFirst, you want me to admit that I killed an Immortalist Sorcerer, and when I do, you don‚Äôt believe me.
 An old soldier like me just can‚Äôt win.‚Äù Van‚Äôdret was too smart not to pick up his hint, ‚ÄúAn old soldier?‚Äù he asked very quietly.
 ‚ÄúMy turn to ask a question,‚Äù said Rodregas.
 ‚ÄúHow did you connect the three of us to these crimes?‚Äù Van‚Äôdret shrugged and smiled and said, ‚ÄúTo be honest, I did not really think you were the ones.
 I simply did not like you, and the way you hung out with non-Celestials.
 It is unnatural.

When he turned to the last two he saw that they were very interested in what he was saying.
 ‚ÄúWhere do you go, Sir Paladin?‚Äù He showed no sense of humor at Rodregas‚Äô little joke about being a Paladin; Rodregas hoped Doi‚Äôvan had not taken him literally.
 ‚ÄúAs far as I can, is my main plan at the moment.
 Clearly the Guild of the Celestial Path is going to be looking for me.
 Let‚Äôs just say I don‚Äôt wish to be found anywhere right now.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd if they find you‚Ä¶ and they will in time, will you then become a Vengeance Daemon?‚Äù asked the Hellborn.
 Rodregas simply flourished his short swords and smiled and stated, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just say that it should be interesting.‚Äù The Hellborn nodded very thoughtfully at Rodregas reply.
 The half AElf had followed the conversation between them with obvious interest, and quickly followed Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs‚Äô lead in swearing the oath to the All-Father.
 But with the two of them the oath seemed different, more easily said and with no need for threats.
 Rodregas was not sure why, but he decided it was something to think about when he had more time.
 The rest of the night passed quickly as Rodregas did his best to bandage his stomach wound.

 Harruq found his blades without too much trouble.
 He laid Qurrah down.
 His brother slept peacefully, and in silence the half-orc took the old weapons into his hands.

Chevelle glanced at me occasionally but kept himself busy around the fire.

 I noticed the map on my palms.

 So she kissed his cheek and then headed for the bathroom.

Training imparts skills, but education increases the capacity of the individual at a more basic level, making the mind more active and alert, converting physical energy into mental energy, training us to see things from a wider perspective, to question and challenge the status quo, to think and imagine, to innovate and invent, to make decisions for ourselves and to act on our own initiative.
 Education is the process by which society passes on the accumulated knowledge and experience of countless centuries to new generations in a systematic, concentrated and abridged form, so that today‚Äôs young people can start their lives at the high point of knowledge and wisdom attained by preceding generations.
 Education replaces the slow, subconscious process of trial and error learning with a swift, conscious process.
 This accumulated knowledge is a great power that can be utilized to accelerate human development and abridge the time needed for society to arrive at progressively higher levels of material, social and psychological fulfilment.
 Despite the massive efforts of international institutions to create awareness of the vital role of education in peace, democracy, economic development, population control and environmental protection, progress on extending the benefits of education to all humankind is still grossly inadequate.
 In 1990, 948 million people or about 20 per cent of the entire world population lacked even basic literacy skills.
 Adult literacy rates in the least developed nations still average less than 50 per cent and are less than half that in a number of countries.
 Unless more intensive efforts are made, worldwide the absolute number of the illiterate will decline only marginally by the year 2000.
 Illiteracy is likely to increase by 10 per cent in South Asia ‚Äì home to more than 40 per cent of the world‚Äôs illiterate ‚Äì and by nearly 7 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa.
 Although universal primary education has been a goal for decades and primary education has been made compulsory in most countries, 128 million children living in remote rural areas, urban slums and refugee camps ‚Äì representing 20 per cent of the total school-age population ‚Äì are still excluded from primary education.

 ‚ÄúWhy, Harruq?

"So you don't need to sleep.

 Alec was close enough now that I could see his smile.
 It reached out and wrapped itself around me like a warm blanket.
 "Well, I do spend a fairly significant amount of time each day sitting in class.
 Kind of like someone else I know."
 "Unacceptable.
 I've added that up in my head, and you've still got several hours each day that you haven't accounted for."
 Despite my best efforts, I was mumbling so badly I wasn't sure anything I'd said was comprehensible.

The half-orc swung his glowing black blades, cutting his bow, and his body, in twain.
 As the blood poured free, he roared, looked about, and then ran off toward the sound of combat.
 A frail form in rags followed from inside the house, a mirror image in looks but for the paler skin and lack of muscle.
 ‚ÄúYou saw nothing,‚Äù this second half-orc said to him before following the warrior.
 Antonil struggled to his feet, shaking his head all the while.
 ‚ÄúIt keeps getting stranger,‚Äù he muttered.
 He took a step and immediately regretted it.
 As his leg throbbed, he yanked the arrow out.
 His armor had kept it from penetrating too deeply, the barbs unable to latch onto any soft flesh.

Doi‚Äôvan nodded and then said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get out of the chamber.‚Äù Rodregas nodded, as he wanted to check on Imeralda.
 Doi‚Äôvan seemed to have his balance back.
 Rodregas wondered if Doi‚Äôvan had lost his balance because he had been trying to fly instead of walk.
 As they stepped out of the room of Infernal sigils and carefully closed the door behind them, Doi‚Äòvan still seemed unsteady and Rodregas wondered if his own experiences had prepared him more naturally for this.
 Rodregas had changed bodies before.
 ‚ÄúDoi‚Äôvan, why don‚Äôt you sit down and rest for a second?
 I will check on Imeralda,‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan nodded his thanks and sank down on the floor.
 Doi‚Äôvan seemed to need to think more than rest, but either way Rodregas made sure he was ok and then went to check on Imeralda.
 He hoped she had not touched the One Tree.
 As he approached where Imeralda had shown them the door he was dismayed to see only black stone.

Truly, life is as powerful an element as any.‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù Rodregas said, realizing he had accidentally insulted the healer, ‚ÄúI have never spent much time with Nymphs.‚Äù Rodregas‚Äô tone was quieter.
 The Nymph seemed young and smart and gifted.
 Rodregas knew he did not have to like him.
 But clearly from Imeralda‚Äôs introduction, this Nymph was well known and powerful among his people, and he had saved both Rodregas‚Äô and Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs lives.
 There was an awkward moment until Doi‚Äôvan appeared at the door.
 He walked with the help of a tall walking stick.

"Oh.
 OK."  She went to do as he said.
 Marie had been to the shore before, but it had been years ago.
 Her father didn't think it was appropriate for a young woman of her position to be parading around half naked.
 If only he could see her now, she thought with a grin as she took off her shirt and shorts.
 There were only a handful of other people on the beach.
 Rick and Marie went for a stroll--or rather, Rick strolled while Marie ran into and out of the surf.
 When they returned to their blanket an hour later, she was tired enough to be talked into sunbathing for a while.
 "Put some of this lotion all over your skin so you won't get burned."
 Rick handed her a bottle.

The speed of my passage wrung tears from my eyes, but I didn't dare slow.
 They were back there, four of them moving with speed only slightly less than my own, noses to the ground to follow my scent, save for the moments in which they let loose their unearthly howls.
 A flicker of motion up ahead should have made me pull up in fear, but the smell accompanying it was somehow familiar, somehow safe.
 I knew if I could reach the shadowy person I'd been unconsciously following, I'd be safe, but he was so incredibly fast and my pursuers were gaining.
 ** The sound of my alarm pulled me out of a whole series of nightmares in which I was running from unknown menaces.
 Each had been terrifying, but none as vivid as the first.
 Bad dreams had become a frequent companion since the accident.
 It'd become nearly pass√© to wake up emotionally exhausted from what should have been a restful night, but these dreams had been different.
 I'd played out nearly every possible combination of events since the accident.
 Dreams where I was the one driving instead of Cindi.

"Don't use the microwave without me!"
 After dinner they spent the evening watching TV.
 For Rick, it was almost like watching TV with a child: Marie had questions about everything.
 It was fun to watch the wonder on her face and the avid attention she gave the programs.
 "I'm afraid I'm going to have to go to bed, Marie.
 I'm worn out, and I have to get up early tomorrow," Rick told her when the movie ended at 11:30.
 "Oh."
 Tomorrow she had to get up early too.
 She had to get to the garden before the fog lifted.
 She'd had fun today, but she had to get home tomorrow.

 But then the noise stopped.

 ‚ÄúTrust me, I would like to know that answer more then you.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs smile was now long gone and with a shrug of his huge misshaped shoulders, he changed the subject.
 ‚ÄúSo, Imeralda, the stone here still seems strong and like new, though clearly, it has been long after the construction of this place.‚Äù She was looking at Doi‚Äôvan strangely and it seemed to take her a moment to shift gears and answer his question.
 ‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶of course construction like this‚Ä¶stone enchanted to absorb the power‚Ä¶it makes the stone stronger with that power.
 Stones formed like this will last as long as the ley line does not move, which happens only rarely and over centuries.
 What is strange is this is not a farm designed by Nymphs.
 The design of the home and barn is clearly human, yet it would be strange for a simple farmer to be able to afford to have his building built of Nymph stone and way up here in this remote place,‚Äù She said.
 ‚ÄúSir Paladin,‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan asked, ‚ÄúYou said you traveled here the first time with friends.
 Might they tell folks of this place?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Rodregas answered, ‚Äúthey were not exactly friends, and they both died long ago.

He'd loved studying history in school, and Abraham Lincoln had never appeared.
 He scowled at the chicken as he took it from the oven.
 How was he going to help her get back?
 He didn't have much faith-- Marie's scream almost made him drop the chicken.
 Depositing the pan on the stove, he ran to the living room.
 She was sitting up, gasping for breath, a look of terror on her face.

She gave him a quick smile before slipping into her room.
 Rick's smile had become a frown by the time he was in his own room.
 He wasn't sure this trip was such a good idea after all.
 Sharing her dream was going to make him fall even more deeply in love with her.
 And when she left, he'd be devastated.
 But remembering the excitement on her face as she'd danced with the actor, he couldn't regret it.
 The next day they went to Universal Studios.

And I think a September wedding would be perfect."
 They discussed bridesmaids and flowers and gardens.
 Marie would wear her mother's wedding gown, which had been carefully stored away for the last 28 years.
 Marie's grandmother had worn it as well, and when Marie took it off after her own wedding, it would go into storage for her daughter.
 Davis chose the next day to approach her father.
 "Come in, my boy," Jefferson Tranton told him, waving the young man into a large, comfortable chair opposite his own in his den.
 "You seemed rather anxious when you telephoned last night."
 "I have to confess that I was.
 Still am."
 He offered his employer a slight smile.

"Because we have a better chance to get to know each other."
 He took her hand, kissing the back of her fingers.
 "This week we've exercised, done laundry, shopped, gone to the beach, cooked, watched TV, and talked the whole time.
 Well, except when we were watching TV, and even then your questions helped me to get to know you."
 She laid her head on his shoulder, pleased but confused.
 Rick was so different from Davis.
 She wished that she could talk about him with her mother.
 But when she could again talk with her mother, there'd be no point.
 Rick would be gone.
 That thought brought tears to her eyes, and she snuggled closer to him, wishing she could have everyone she cared about in the same decade.

 Like when you‚Äôre playing flip ball and you want your piece to go in so bad you lean hard to ‚Äòhelp‚Äô it.‚Äù I remembered the game from when I‚Äôd first come to the village.
 The children would be bound from magic and have to throw an odd-shaped piece into the corresponding hole on a game board across from them.
 They would lean forward after they threw, sometimes bouncing and chanting, ‚ÄúCome on, come on,‚Äù twisting like somehow wishing would make the ball respond.
 The game had held no interest for me.
 I didn‚Äôt have to be bound to not have magic.
 It wasn‚Äôt a novelty, it was everyday life.

 "You've never actually been on a school bus before, have you?"

 I found myself returning her smile.
 You really couldn't spend any time around Rachel and not find yourself smiling.

He wouldn‚Äôt have been lonely if he‚Äôd married Kim or Gina or Sabrina, but he wouldn‚Äôt have been happy.
 Even sex was no longer enough to motivate him to get into a relationship like those.
 He wanted someone he could be completely at ease with.

 All his married buddies told him he was dreaming, that marriage was a strain, a series of trade-offs.
 But he couldn‚Äôt help hoping there was something better than that.
 Or at least someone he could love so much that he wouldn‚Äôt even notice the trade-offs.

It worked!
 Clearly his opponent, though set for a heavy blow, was not expecting the strength of Rodregas‚Äô bash.
 Still his opponent was too good to fall, even when surprised.
 And even as he half fell backwards he used the momentum to slide down and try to land a blow low under the shield.
 Rodregas had both quickness and strength on his side.
 He blocked the blow with his sword and then bashed down quick and hard multiple times with his shield.
 He thought he heard a bone break.
 Rodregas paused and the knight signaled him as victor with a finger to the Heavens.
 Rodregas followed this pattern throughout the day.
 He kept using his sword more to block than to attack and kept using his shield offensively.

Human development strategies focus on improving the welfare and capacities of the individual through better health, education, political choice and economic opportunity.
 Together they encompass the two basic components of all development personal and institutional, individual and collective.
 The challenge is to develop simultaneously both individual and social capacities and utilize their potentials in a complementary manner.
 For the individual, development involves acquisition of greater know ledge, more progressive attitudes, improved skills and higher values.
 For the collective, development involves establishment of more useful and productive institutions, systems, organizations and cultural values.
 The conventional view that development is essentially a function of scarce economic inputs must give way to the perception that the opportunities and potentials for rapid development far exceed actual achievements in every country.
 Looking back over the past few decades, we realize that the speed of social progress could certainly have been much greater than it was.
 The tremendous potential for accelerating development is most easily illustrated by in stances in which actual achievements substantially excelled expectations, such as the enormous leap in world agriculture during the 1960s and 1970s and the phenomenal growth of incomes, employment and exports in East Asia during the last ten years.
 These unforeseen accomplishments reflect the magnitude of potentials that these countries possessed but had not previously utilized.
 The untapped resources of the society can be categorized under several headings:

92m democracy0m92m,0m Samaria and Islamic civilization. The individual can ‚Äú92mover0mize too much‚Äù and therefore is entitled to fields of development.

 ‚ÄúWhy am I not a lady?‚Äù Aurelia asked.
 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Harruq said.
 ‚ÄúDid you cast a spell on yourself or something?
 Look like one to me.‚Äù
 She stood and took up her staff.
 Instead of grabbing his swords, Harruq ducked behind a tree.
 ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt hurt me,‚Äù he shouted.
 His face poked around the tree, his long brown hair falling down past his eyes.

‚ÄúOh you have to come to Igneeria, miss.‚Äù ‚ÄúWow wait, hold it!‚Äù I held my hands out.
 ‚ÄúBuddy, you just show up talking about some destiny that we don‚Äôt know about and then you say that we have to come to some place that‚Äôs not here, and you expect us to go?
 What about our families and people who‚Äôd ask questions, if we disappear.
 What do we say, oh sorry about that everyone, we just felt like leaving Earth to go to this magical place called Igneeria to do something that we don‚Äôt know about.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell of course, there will be some minor difficulties,‚Äù he said.

 I didn‚Äôt know if I was relieved.
 My mind went over the encounter again as I made my way home.
 Did he always wear such a stern expression?
 Why was he looking at me so intensely?
 But I had my answer: Because you keep staring at him, fool.
 It seemed to me Fannie always knew when I didn‚Äôt want to be bothered and went out of her way to ensure I was.

And he certainly liked kissing her.
 Marie frowned.
 Last night‚Äôs kiss hadn't been pleasant at all.
 It had hurt.
 Was that what married kisses were like?
 Her mother had told her that Davis would have a harder time controlling himself now that they were betrothed.
 Maybe he'd just lost control of himself.

The cut of his clothing hinted at designer origins, but the garment was mostly notable for the way it stretched over a pair of broad shoulders that looked like they'd been chiseled from marble, or possibly cast in bronze.
 My eyes made it as far as the equally impressive chest before I forced them upwards.
 Anyone built like that should be ugly to keep things in balance.
 Not him.
 His square jaw and even features were nothing less than perfection.
 If he ever chose to model, the editors of every major fashion magazine would have pulled out all the stops to land the contract for his debut appearance.
 The whole issue would have to be pictures of him though.
 No amount of airbrushing would suffice to allow other men to ever share the same magazine with him.

Recent events in Eastern Europe demonstrate that where states attempt to use authority as the lever for agricultural development, the achievements are likely to be limited and short-lived.
 The inability of the authoritarian system to produce enough food for its people was one of the major factors contributing to its downfall.
 Democracy is the most potent fertilizer to ensure food security at the household level.
 ICPF was founded at a time when a consensus was emerging worldwide that drastic steps were needed to wipe out the hunger and famine that were ravaging parts of the developing world and afflicting to a lesser extent poorer sections of the industrial nations.
 Recognizing that the problem of food was inextricably intertwined with the problems of peace, political and social stability, and employment, and that no comprehensive solution to one was possible without substantial progress on the others, it was our hope and intention that this growing consensus on food could be harnessed to accelerate progress on arms control and disarmament.
 Ironically, events have unfolded in the reverse sequence.
 Rapid progress has been made during the intervening years to reduce international tensions, but little has yet been done effectively to address the food issue.
 Now that opportunity is before us and compels us to act, for without significant progress on abolishing hunger from the earth, our efforts at arms control and peace making may come to naught.
 Increasing the availability of food and jobs form essential components of a comprehensive strategy to eradicate hunger, poverty and violence from the world.

I'd had plenty of bad times over the last year or so to offset the near perfection of my life now, but it still didn't seem like something that could last.
 We just sat there in silence with his arms wrapped around me for several minutes before his cell phone rang.
 Sometimes I wondered if the slim device was some kind of super spy phone.
 It seemed to get reception in some of the most incredible places.
 He shifted around just enough to answer it without letting go of me with his right arm.
 "What's up?"
 Whoever was on the other end was talking too quietly for me to make out more than the occasional word.
 "...Jack...now...no time..." I could suddenly feel the energy radiating off of Alec as his beast woke and rose to the surface.
 His limbs hadn't taken on the fine tremble of someone only seconds away from changing shape, but he was obviously unhappy.
 Given the tight leash he kept his beast on, I would have been willing to bet that just about anyone else in the pack would have already shifted shapes and ripped a tree out of the ground or done something equally destructive by now.

The danger to all nations of unexpected and unprovoked attack from near or distant powers can be vastly reduced by declaring an immediate ban on the use of ballistic missiles of all types, including those carrying conventional warheads.
 This proposal, first put forth by US President Reagan in 1986, would eliminate the discriminatory provisions that deny missile acquisition to some, while preserving the right of others to maintain and develop this purely offensive capability.
 It would also eliminate the need for missile defence systems, which no nation can afford and which are the only possible defence against ballistic missile weapons.
 The ban on use should be followed by urgent measures to dismantle and scrap this entire class of weapons worldwide.
 Technically, a prohibition on testing and deployment of ballistic missiles would be far more verifiable than any limits on nuclear proliferation.
 Monitoring stations at missile production facilities and existing surveillance systems can restrain manufacture and detect test flights.
 Evading a ban on testing would be practically impossible.
 Small Arms, Drugs, Crime and Terrorism
 Four decades of preoccupation with nuclear weapons have blinded policy makers to an extremely dangerous and destabilizing threat to nations and their citizenry from the other end of the weapons spectrum ‚Äì the proliferation of small arms.
 The shift in the nature of conflicts from massive wars between states by regular armed forces over a wide region or encompassing the globe to small, inter-state or intra-state warfare by irregular forces, insurgents, criminal or terrorist groups infiltrating and often indistinguishable from the general population has led to a frighteningly swift and widespread proliferation of small arms.

 She felt guilty for spying on him, but Aurelia was convinced she had no other choice.
 Over the past month, she had grown close to the half-orc Harruq Tun, and with that closeness was danger.

 Only one of them could be right, but who?

 No one knows how many he wrote before he brought the first one to the group, the one that would later be their most requested song, ‚ÄúI Love my Aunt Jemima.‚Äù  Soon, though, he was bringing in songs in coacervations, as if he had eons of them bubbling up.
 That first acceptance by the group opened the floodgates and Buddy Gardner became something of a songwriting machine.

I started shivering instantly.
 As much as my body had been through in the last few hours, I needed to find shelter before I got chilled.
 The next lightning strike was so close it lit the entire sky up.
 The telltale flash of glass up ahead was just enough to guide me to a door that was nearly hidden by the rampant foliage.
 I pulled the door open with less effort than expected, and slipped inside.
 The heady fragrance of flowers told me immediately what I'd stumbled across.
 "As if there wasn't enough greenery outside, he's got to have an entire greenhouse too."
 The abrupt lessening of the rain assaulting the glass roof brought back my sense of urgency.
 Nobody could possibly find me while the most intense rainstorm since Noah had sealed up the ark was going on, but I couldn't stay here once it stopped.
 I slipped my battered shoes onto my abused feet, and turned to leave just as the door opened of its own accord.

The night came when the father was taken for the ceremony.
 Rodregas was on guard duty when Korin came down in his new body.
 The poor lad had stared at the man who had been his father, saying nothing, but tears ran down his cheeks.
 The apprentice Immortalist had then proceeded to rape the mother.
 The Adapt was rough and the act was violent and Korin, in his new body, clearly enjoyed the violence more than the sex.
 After he had finished with the mother, he had the guards release the boy who had run over to his sobbing bleeding mother.
 In a fatherly gesture Korin had kissed the boy on the cheek and, wrapping his hands around the boy‚Äôs head in a slow loving gesture, made a quick yank and broke Join‚Äôs neck.
 The next day the guards released the young AElfin widow.
 Rodregas had helped drag her beyond the gates.
 She lay there not moving, limp though alive; she was dead in every way that mattered.

Like the stone of the farmhouse, the stone construction of the Cathedral had been enchanted by Nymphs of the Earth.
 It was said that the ley lines were tapped to provide magical protections as great as the physical.
 The Cathedral‚Äôs defenses gave it the reputation as one of the most impenetrable fortress in the Eastern Realms.
 Of course, Rodregas thought what could not be taken by force, could be easily taken by politics and fear.
 Once through both the huge gates, Rodregas, Doi‚Äôvan and Imeralda came into full view of the Great Cathedral of the Heavens.
 The Cathedral served as both fortress and a temple to the Celestial Gods, and its thick walls were a balance of the practical and the artistic.
 Its towering white walls were adorned with statues and engravings.
 Above the ground floor were huge stained glass windows and arches and on the heights were a series of small towers and domes.
 Rodregas had forgotten how striking the building was and all three stood to admire it for a long moment before moving forward into the inner courtyard.
 In front of the Cathedral set a grandly engraved table of gleaming oak which looked to be more suitable for the dining hall of a noble than in the great courtyard.

The organized confusion of a true artist met my gaze.
 I'd seen it with my mom, when she was so driven to complete a shot that she couldn't be bothered to clean up after herself.
 She left just enough structure to the mess to find needed tools, but didn't waste any effort on anything that wouldn't help her with her great aim.
 Brushes were scattered everywhere, old and new canvases stacked in the corners of the studio, and flecks of paint had found their way onto almost every visible surface.
 The rich smell of paint was nearly overpowering, but I noticed it only in passing as I made a beeline towards the easel that dominated the center of the space.
 The painting was still wet, right down to the signature which had been done in the palest green.
 The scene was from the point of view of someone looking into a bedroom window, darker than most of the later stuff I'd just looked at.
 The centerpiece, done in a dimmer light than what I remembered from my dreams, was the sleeping figure.
 She was delicate-looking.
 A tiny figure, a being of light temporarily clothed in flesh, one who seemed almost at the point of breaking out of her mortal husk.

Geriodon had a full suit of Night Bronze armor which was plain and serviceable looking.
 Nordien‚Äôs armor was a work of art.
 His great helm had a purple feather sticking out the top and he had a short, matching cape coming out the back.
 Rodregas decided that he would go after Nordien first.
 He would make sure the favorite of Ambassador Van‚Äôdret would not win if nothing else.
 If Geriodon became a knight at least an honorable man had the day.
 Several of the squires were being seen to by attendants making sure everything was secure, and waiting for the start of the match.
 Rodregas thought he was alone until he heard Imeralda speak from behind him, ‚ÄúDid you see who is watching from the Great Hall‚Äôs door?‚Äù she asked.
 Rodregas glanced over, it was Van‚Äôdret.
 He stood tall and handsome, young squires surrounding him ready to serve.

When the guards charged in to stop the shooting, then it would be his turn to strike.
 Rodregas would have to take on as many of the slavers and guards as possible.
 It would do little good to get caught up in a one-on-one battle; the odds were too many against them.
 He had to use his new strength and speed and go after multiple targets.
 Rodregas focused on his breathing, he needed his body ready.
 He rested his body against the tree, trying not to tense up, and breathed deep and slow.
 Quicker than he thought, Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs black bow came up and he started to shoot.
 The Black Yew bows were an incredible advantage, they had been the pride of Raven Keep and were among the most dangerous and rare weapons that the Nymphs used to protect themselves.
 Those bows had primarily been ornamental trophies for Ravenhurr; Rodregas thought that they symbolized a previous victory.
 Only a few of the guards would have had the power to use them and Ravenhurr kept guards with even small power away from the keep.

I already knew I wasn't hungry; the only real decision was how much of Mom's wrath I was willing to face later on.
 It wasn't until I had my hand on the doorknob that I remembered Brandon's promise to pick me up.
 I was so tired I actually considered for a second that he might have been serious.
 Sitting in his car, fighting not to look at his smiling gray eyes, it'd all seemed so reasonable.
 I'd lost my ride and he was grateful I'd saved him from having to interfere with Cassie, so he was going to become my personal chauffeur for the rest of the year.
 Looking at my empty lane, the school bus only minutes away, it seemed more likely Brandon wouldn't even remember talking to me.
 Just like every hot boy with every loser since the dawn of time.
 The thought hurt a little, but I'd had plenty of years to come to understand boys like that didn't go after girls like me.
 Instead of dwelling on it, greenhouse gases or anything else I couldn't change, I simply shrugged my backpack a little higher and started down the lane.
 Some kind of bird was merrily announcing to the world that he was ridiculously happy the sun was just rising, and that it was already pushing eighty degrees with the promise of something much, much worse before lunch.

He ran to where the sixty elves that had lined the street engaged a large portion of his army.
 They had discarded their bows and drawn swords, wielding them with a precision his men would be blessed to ever match.
 They didn‚Äôt need to, for they had numbers, momentum, and morale.
 When Antonil shoved to the front line, they also had leadership.
 The sixty dwindled to forty before fleeing.
 ‚ÄúGive chase,‚Äù Antonil shouted.
 ‚ÄúThose in the back, flush them out of the houses.‚Äù
 Velixar watched the Neldaren army scatter, some chasing elves down streets, others barging into locked homes.

She doesn't like to listen to me, and when she gets mad, things get very unpleasant."
 It was a weak explanation, but there was something in his voice that made me believe him.
 The few doubts I still had melted away as I finally met his eyes.
 I've always been pretty good at reading people, and I'd never seen anyone whose eyes conveyed that level of sincerity.
 My voice caught, and it took a couple of tries to get actual words out.

 Brandon shook his head.

I didn‚Äôt have a counter for that and he knew it.
 He took advantage of the silence, giving orders to Ruby.

The pervasive influence of science in society requires that we bridge the gap that presently divides the sciences and humanities and evolve an educational system in which science is no longer regarded as a specialized field of study.
 Fourth, radical changes are needed in the content of school curricula at all levels to make education relevant to the real needs of the students and the development of the country.
 The society whose system of education is integrated with the social aspirations of the country will develop most rapidly.
 The system of education prevalent in most developing countries is oriented toward the outer form ‚Äì acquiring a degree or qualifying certificate ‚Äì rather than the inner content of knowledge.
 Educated unemployment is a direct result of a system that fosters obedience and rote learning rather than individual initiative and creative thinking.
 A new system of development education needs to be introduced at all levels to equip the student with an understanding of his/her society, its achievements and potentials, and the opportunities open to each individual to participate in its future growth.
 The index of its success will be the extent to which students of this curriculum seek self-employment rather than salaried jobs.
 Fifth, minimum and average educational levels should be raised in all countries.
 Two centuries ago education was a luxury of the rich and it was simply inconceivable that every member of the population in any country could receive even a minimum level of education.
 Few of the industrial nations fully meet their own present minimum standards for every citizen.

students will not be allowed to exceed these minimum requirements as long as92m qualified0m students possess degrees in literature as well92m as0m history. Education is92m a0m matter of92m social0m necessity and State can impose the minimums on its level of92m education0m. But foreign investment is the driving force of a private sector that will enhance the development

I mirrored Rachel's actions, wrapping my free arm around Jess as I whipped my head back and forth in an effort to figure out what was going on.
 We were pressed up against one corner of the pavilion, with what I assumed was the rest of the pack between us and everyone else.
 For a moment the wall of bodies precluded figuring out what was going on, but then Isaac shifted slightly to the left, and I saw Brandon and Vincent through the gap.
 The pools of black where Vincent's eyes should have been finally made me aware of the prickle of energy arcing back and forth between the two rival groups.
 I couldn't imagine what it must feel like where Alec or Brandon were standing.
 Even just the fringe of power dancing over my arms and shoulders was enough to make me profoundly grateful I wasn't any closer to the epicenter.
 Vincent's sadistic smile sent shivers down my spine, but it was nothing compared to Brandon's expression.
 I'd known for a couple of weeks now that what the outside world saw was nothing more than a mask, but I hadn't realized just what was under the facade.
 Now I knew.
 It was like he'd spent the last few days peeling back some of the layers that'd hidden him, and the sheer inhumanity waiting underneath completely distracted me from the throbbing in my ankle.

 ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre playing a joke on me, I want to take one of your televisions home with me.‚Äù  Returning her attention to the mushroom, she frowned.

Haunting eyes set above terrible fangs.
 Instead I found myself lying atop a gigantic bed in a room I didn't recognize.
 The sheer shock at still being alive prevented my mind from working very well.
 It took several minutes before all of the other relatively inconsequential details started filtering in.
 My hands were bandaged, as was my elbow and right calf.
 My dirty, ripped jeans and shirt had been replaced with clean clothes that were only a little too small.
 That last fact should have alarmed me more than it did.
 Somehow being stripped down by a stranger paled in comparison to a near-death hallucination involving wolves and a monster straight out of a science fiction movie.
 The bedroom was possibly the nicest room I'd ever been in.

He waited for another punch, but nothing came.

For no good reason except the fear of fear, my heart would race, my lungs and throat constrict, my hands become slick with sweat.

"You mean there's another picture now?"
 He laughed.
 "There's something on 24 hours a day."
 "Really?"
 She beamed with delight.
 "Is there something funny playing?"
 He found an "I Love Lucy" rerun listed and changed channels.
 For the next hour he got more pleasure from watching Marie watch the program than he could possibly have gotten from the program itself.
 She didn't take her eyes off the screen, and because it was free of sexual innuendo, she understood most of the comedy.

The next lightning strike was so close it lit the entire sky up.
 The telltale flash of glass up ahead was just enough to guide me to a door that was nearly hidden by the rampant foliage.
 I pulled the door open with less effort than expected, and slipped inside.
 The heady fragrance of flowers told me immediately what I'd stumbled across.
 "As if there wasn't enough greenery outside, he's got to have an entire greenhouse too."
 The abrupt lessening of the rain assaulting the glass roof brought back my sense of urgency.
 Nobody could possibly find me while the most intense rainstorm since Noah had sealed up the ark was going on, but I couldn't stay here once it stopped.
 I slipped my battered shoes onto my abused feet, and turned to leave just as the door opened of its own accord.
 I fell back in amazement as he stepped into the pool of light that'd materialized as the clouds parted.
 The jeans were mundane, perfect, but completely normal for all that they were snug in all the right places and loose everywhere else.

 In spite of her lack of sleep, Marie awoke early the next morning.
 She couldn't wait to go to the shore.
 After her walk through the garden, Rick wanted to go back to bed for a while, but she begged him to leave right away.
 Excitedly she put on her bathing suit, glad that there was no full-length mirror in her room.

The lances shattered into shards when slammed against it.
 The ball of magma halted when touching the barrier and then reversed direction.
 The elf glared, detonating the attack with a thought.
 Molten rock covered the street, splattering across both Velixar‚Äôs and Aurelia‚Äôs shields before sliding to the dirt.
 ‚ÄúHow long can you keep this up?‚Äù the necromancer asked.
 He took out a bag of bones and scattered more than thirty pieces.
 ‚ÄúHow long before you break?‚Äù
 One by one, the bone pieces shot straight at Aurelia.
 The elf dropped to one knee, words of magic streaming out her mouth as fast as she could speak them.
 Her magical shield could halt attacks of pure magical essence, such as the conjured fire, but animated objects were a different matter.

If he slowly increased the heat of his kisses and caresses, made her so hot that she stopped thinking altogether, made her so wild with desire .

 Rick closed his eyes, flushed with both desire and chagrin.
 He'd just told Marie he wouldn't do anything to hurt her.
 She was a virgin and planned to be one until her wedding night.
 How could he take that from her?
 How could he use an act of love to manipulate her into staying with him?
 And if she decided to go home anyway, how could he let her go home with the shame he knew she'd feel?
 He couldn't do it.

You can call me‚Ä¶,‚Äù he thought for a minute, making it obvious he was making up a fake name.
 He did not want to use his real name.
 He thought to himself, ‚ÄúWho do I want to be?‚Äù ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm going to try to fight against the Immortalists, then some sort of name fit for a Celestial Paladin, or maybe one fit for an Infernal adversary was needed,‚Äù he thought with a smile.
 The only way he could have survived the ceremony would have been divine intervention, so he said the first thing that came to mind, ‚ÄúYou can call me Sir Paladin, that will work for now,‚Äù he said it with a smile and a slight snicker at his own joke.
 ‚ÄúJust what kind of Paladin would you be?‚Äù Imeralda asked him.
 ‚ÄúWhy, it should be obvious to you more than anyone,‚Äù Rodregas said with a slight bow to the beautiful half AElf.
 ‚ÄúThe kind of heroic Paladin that rescues beautiful maidens in distress and frees‚Äô innocent prisoners from the dungeons of evil sorcerers.‚Äù Rodregas could not help but smile at his own line.
 He had always found that a good joke was like a good insult; the best always had enough truth in them to sting.
 Geor smiled, but the others seemed not to have appreciated his little joke.
 The AElf maiden just looked at Rodregas quietly and thoughtfully.

I decided to read all I could find on the subject of love.
 I read C.S.
 Lewis, Erich Fromm, Thomas Merton, and a dozen or so other books I came across or got led to, even the Kama Sutra.
 Then, supposing I knew as much about love as I ever would, I turned to reading mystery novels, since writing them had become my occupation.
 The Truth
 I mean to be hard on myself and dedicate these pages to honesty, even if it gets brutal.
 My beloved grandmother, Mary Garfield, often assured me that a liar was the worst of all people.
 No doubt she recognized how liars teach us not to trust.
 I believe it was Sylvia Curtis, when Eric and I talked to her about Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, who convinced me that Holden Caulfield was right to pour most of his wrath on phonies.
 When Olga Savitsky and I considered founding a church, we agreed that above the entrance would hang a sign, ‚ÄúNo bullshit allowed.‚Äù After all, God is a matter of life and death.

Several factors have impeded achievement of higher agricultural growth rates in the region: political instability and civil unrest, poor macro-economic and agricultural policies, drought, and physical difficulties in farming in some areas.
 The ravages of war have had the most devastating effect, but inadequate and counter-productive policies have also had a major impact.
 Low mandated prices for agricultural products have acted as a disincentive to producers.
 State control of farm support systems, including marketing, transportation and input supply, is highly bureaucratic, inefficient, and, often, corrupt.
 Overvalued exchange rates encourage the import of low-priced farm products, depress local farm incomes, and make exports uncompetitive.
 Underdeveloped infrastructure results in high transport and marketing costs.
 The slow rate of technological development and diffusion have slowed growth in agricultural productivity.
 Irrigation potential is underdeveloped and poorly managed.
 A major international commitment is needed to reverse the trends and end the famine threat in Africa.
 The region possesses considerable potential that could be converted into higher rates of growth.

 agricultural development is associated with rising agricultural service costs, high agricultural92m efficiency0m, high minimum income, inadequate rural labor92m debt0m and92m financing0m, and the growing92m 0mduplication of agricultural training.

Or, a miracle might bring him back to life.
 A whole new question arises.
 What if, while Eric lay comatose, he was given once more the choice to live, as I'm coming to believe he was given the choice before leaving for the desert in Kenny‚Äôs mom‚Äôs Volkswagen?
 If Kenny were still alive, I would ask him to describe, as best his memory would serve him, Eric‚Äôs expression and voice when he insisted they leave without Billy and me.
 The Bible implies that Jesus, had he been a less than perfect, could have chosen another fate than crucifixion.
 Only he chose trust his father‚Äôs will above his own, which was limited by his humanity, as ours is, in spades.
 Maybe twice, at least, Eric chose to die for me.
 Still, because Eric didn‚Äôt create himself, to worship him would be like praising Hamlet rather than Shakespeare.
 Besides, if Eric died for me, it probably wasn‚Äôt the human in him, but the Christ.
 So I will take care not to worship Eric, only adore him.

Aaron himself92m do0m this for me. And doesn't that make things even more likely when I start wondering who is wrong with92m me0m, when the Bible dictates clearly92m at0m92m this0m point?<eop> But why did Eric choose to die, for person,92m yet0m he dressed like fresh skin? What did he do

"I'm sorry, Marie."
 He hugged her, murmuring, "We won't give up.
 And one morning when you least expect it, you'll walk back into your own garden."
 Marie closed her eyes, drawing strength from Rick.
 She just hoped he was right.
 And she hoped it would happen soon.
 After Rick had left for work, Marie walked on the treadmill for nearly 45 minutes and then made herself a cup of tea.
 Rested, she opened the box containing the exercise movie Rick had gotten her and with delight put it into the BCR.
 No--VCR, she corrected herself.
 She got so involved in the exercises and then exploring the house that she'd only watched one of the movies--"Gone with the Wind," which made her laugh sometimes and cry sometimes and held her spellbound the entire time--by 5:30, when Rick got home from work.

The great Celestial Lion was on the hunt and when he found his prey, there would be a battle to shake all the realms.
 As the roar faded in the heavens, a new Knight Captain, a chosen Champion of a Goddess, stood in the great Cathedral of the Heavens.

 The other hunters in his pride were at his side and ready.
 It was time to start the hunt.

The Commission, therefore, developed and presented a comprehensive strategy for job-led economic growth.
 Over the past decade, changes in the employment picture lend credence to ICPF‚Äôs perspective.
 The American economy experienced a decade-long expansion, fuelling high levels of employment at home, while stimulating job growth throughout East Asia, attracting a massive influx of foreign technical workers and setting the stage for a global outsourcing boom which is still in its infancy.
 Among the advanced economies, unemployment declined from an average of 6.9 per cent in the period 1985-94 to 6.5 per cent during the last 10 years.
 It fell by 10 per cent in France, 25 per cent in Italy, a third in Netherlands, 50 per cent in Spain and 70 per cent in Ireland.
 It is declining but remains 10 per cent higher than the average for 1985-94 in Germany, which is still recovering from the economic impact of reunification.
 The new market economies of Eastern Europe are growing rapidly.
 But these positive trends are no grounds for complacency.
 While they may dispel fears of an irreversible shrinkage of the job market in OECD countries, the proportion of long term unemployed remains at an unacceptably high 29 per cent of the total, indicating that these countries have not yet evolved successful strategies to address the issue.
 Left to itself, unemployment may continue to deprive large numbers of people in these countries from enjoying basic economic rights, unless concerted steps are taken to remove the perceptual and structural barriers to full employment.

The benefits of eliminating these subsidies would be multiple.
 For instance, eliminating subsidies to sugar-beet growers and dairy farmers in Europe would stimulate greater demand, not only for imported sugar from developing countries, but also for cocoa, which combined with sugar and milk is the basis for the chocolate industry.
 Measures of this type will result in substantially increased demand for agricultural products from developing countries, the first step in an upward spiral of global economic growth that will stimulate industrial exports and job growth in both East and West.
 2.Global, environmentally sustainable Green Revolution.
 The term 'Green Revolution' has been praised for its positive impact on crop productivity and criticized for its likely adverse effects on the environment and social equity.
 It is often overlooked that one of the most beneficial consequences of the Green Revolution has been its 'forest-saving' nature.
 If agricultural production had not been increased through higher productivity, more forest land would have been diverted to annual cropping.
 India alone would have needed at least 50 million hectares of additional land to produce the wheat and rice it now produces, if average yields had remained at pre-Green Revolution levels.
 It is, therefore, important that the concept of higher productivity per unit of land, water, time, energy, labour and capital be extended to all farming systems and all regions.
 Most developing countries will have no option but to produce more food and agricultural commodities from less land and water in the twenty-first century.

They were definitely closer now.
 They'd stopped howling, but I could still hear them.
 I somehow found myself on my back again, looking up at the biggest wolf I'd ever seen.
 TV had given me the impression that a wolf shouldn't be much bigger than a German Shepherd.
 These guys were roughly the size of a small pony, one nearly black, the other more of a gray color, both with yellowish eyes, and lips pulled back to show teeth the size of my fingers.
 Most of my jeans had been torn away from my right calf, which was bleeding fairly profusely, but I didn't feel any pain.
 It was like my mind had finally torn loose from the moorings that usually held it in contact with reality.
 I was going to die, ripped to shreds by the same impossible animals that had killed the hikers a few months ago, but I just couldn't bring myself to care.

He was such a child then, easily influenced and dealing with challenges in counterproductive ways.
 He was caught being truant, being out past curfew, being with a kid who stole a wallet.
 He was involved in multiple car accidents.
 Brandon struggled and was barely making it through high school, so we changed him to a problem-child school to enable him to graduate.
 He and his younger brother Bryce were growing apart just as I had grown apart from my brother Thomas, which was torturous for me and Lisa to watch.
 Brandon dressed like some punk and believed he was the smartest person in the room.
 He became a very obnoxious person.
 At some point, we knew he was back into drugs, we just hoped he wasn‚Äôt getting himself addicted.
 We were kidding ourselves; we felt so powerless.
 He was gaunt, broken out, nervous and angry, telling random stories that always involved the biggest-fastest-shortest-longest-cue-the-orchestra-everybody fucking him over.

Rodregas would have to take on as many of the slavers and guards as possible.
 It would do little good to get caught up in a one-on-one battle; the odds were too many against them.
 He had to use his new strength and speed and go after multiple targets.
 Rodregas focused on his breathing, he needed his body ready.
 He rested his body against the tree, trying not to tense up, and breathed deep and slow.
 Quicker than he thought, Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs black bow came up and he started to shoot.
 The Black Yew bows were an incredible advantage, they had been the pride of Raven Keep and were among the most dangerous and rare weapons that the Nymphs used to protect themselves.
 Those bows had primarily been ornamental trophies for Ravenhurr; Rodregas thought that they symbolized a previous victory.
 Only a few of the guards would have had the power to use them and Ravenhurr kept guards with even small power away from the keep.
 Against the leather armor of the slavers there would be no defense, even if they had shields; the arrows would likely blast through anything they had.

There was a tall brunette already waiting, so I took a seat in one of the hard-plastic chairs.
 The other girl had shorts on just like everyone else, but hers were the shortest I'd seen yet.
 In Minnesota you could always pick out the alpha females by the length of their shorts, and this one seemed to think she was at the top of the food chain.
 That or a complete slut, but with her tan skin and perfect wavy hair, I figured it was probably the former.
 She didn't look like she had to put out to get attention.
 Two minutes later, a smiling blond secretary came waddling out of what was probably the principal's office.
 I spent the time wondering if I should try to make small talk; the gorgeous girl spent it staring out the window.
 The secretary took in the two of us, frowned almost imperceptibly at the length of the shorts and then signed a form for the other girl.
 Determined to at least try and make friends, I started to smile as she turned towards me on her way out, but the expression died as soon as I met her flat green eyes.
 My heart immediately started to race, but she was already gone, moving with grace and confidence out of the suddenly too-small office.

Sharper in my mind now maybe than even when they happened."
 Her hand gripped mine with a fragile strength that hinted at the vibrant, powerful woman she'd been back then.
 Back before the years had worn at her.
 "The pack was huge back then.
 Much larger even than Brandon's is today, but all of that might didn't save Alec's father that night.
 There was a nightmare of blood and death, and when the sun finally touched the earth again the next morning, a full third of our number were dead, and most of those who remained were crippled.
 I would've been one of the former, except for Donovan."
 The questions continued to bubble up inside me, but I throttled them down, suppressing them rather than risking an interruption which might cause her to not finish.
 "At great risk to himself he carried me away from the site of the battle, running and swimming more miles than I care to think about.

Cleo ‚Äì No Elizabeth, you tell him that you love him, and give him an instructional pamphlet with diagrams and small words, not too much in the way of color and shapes because he might get distracted and forget to read the text, not to mention ignore you when you‚Äôre exposing your deepest feelings.
 Liz ‚Äì So your entire theory on men is that they‚Äôre complete imbeciles incapable of doing more than dressing themselves.
 Cleo ‚Äì Dear, most men shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to even pick out their own clothes.
 But no they‚Äôre not complete morons, they‚Äôre quite handy to when it comes to making the clock on the video recorder stop blinking 12:00 for all eternity.
 But when it comes to important things, like knowing what a woman wants, well they‚Äôre hopeless.
 Even on the rare occasions that they actually are paying one hundred percent attention to us, which doesn‚Äôt happen as often as it should.
 They‚Äôre just simple minded, and it‚Äôs better that you learn than now than later.
 Otherwise you might end up like me, and that doesn‚Äôt seem to appeal to you very much.

Adriana, go ahead and get started on your homework.
 When you finish come find me and we'll get you situated."
 As always, Rachel was sitting at her table in the middle of no-man's-land.
 She looked up at me and smiled as I took my usual spot and started on my homework.
 For the first time all day I felt like I could relax.
 The few times I looked up, I saw Britney, who seemed determined not to give in and actually do her homework.
 I finished my two assignments about the time I normally did, and walked over to where Mrs. Campbell was trying to explain a story problem.
 The sophomore she was helping looked like he wanted to be anywhere other than trying to figure out how long it would take Sally to mow the lawn given a certain width of lawn mower moving at a given rate of speed.

His choking face stared directly at me, unquestionably an accusation, and I realized with a start that he was right.
 I was cutting off his windpipe, as if it were there in my outstretched fist.
 I released my grip.
 He was surrounded now, and the room was filled with a roar of commotion and terror.
 My ears rang sharply.
 I had to look away from it all.
 When I turned, I caught my reflection in one of the larger mirrors, but it wasn‚Äôt me.
 No, it must be me, but unrecognizable.
 Not unrecognizable, a voice inside me whispered.

 Doi‚Äôvan continued, ‚ÄúThe first they call ‚Äòopen fist‚Äô which does not really make any sense to me, but it is barehanded with no armor.
 I think you are likely to do very well with that one.
 In fact, I think you would be wise to finish one of the top winners.

 Rodregas could not help but smile, ‚ÄúI know you guys think of my skill with the bow in terms of my inability to use the Black Yew bows.
 But really, I can shoot a bow with skill.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan and Imeralda looked at him doubtfully.
 ‚ÄúThe challenge,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan, ‚Äúis not to be simply good but to be able to outshoot over one hundred other highly skilled warriors, and the targets are multiple and difficult including a moving target.

He raised himself up as the lance lowered down and dodged to the right.
 But the lance followed him this time and he felt his body being ripped off the saddle.
 CHAPTER 14 THE ORDER
 Rodregas blinked at the sunlight in his eyes and raised his hand to create some shade.
 Pain shot through his body at the movement.
 He felt his body, now without armor, for any serious wounds.
 ‚ÄúThe good news is that while the tip of the lance did slice into your chest a bit, it is almost healed thanks to what Jordaan did,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan standing above him.
 Rodregas realized he was lying on the ground over by where Doi‚Äôvan had been keeping the lances and equipment.
 The spare lances were gone.
 He had lost.

 Qurrah‚Äôs thin, ashen face curled into a sneer.

 Perhaps his brother would think him weak, but he would not watch.

 She turned to look at her mother earnestly.

 You should be able to put your arms around him whenever you want without having to fear rejection or disapproval.
 You should feel secure enough with him to know that no mistake you might make will make him stop loving you.

This study can serve as a powerful argument for closer cooperation among the republics.
 The study can be undertaken at very low cost by a consortium of researchers from different research institutes within the Commonwealth of Independent States.
 5.Privatize and develop road transport: Transportation is a major bottleneck to development of a market economy in much of the region.
 Under the centrally planned system, most freight was hauled by trains over main routes to large cities for distribution in bulk by huge government procurement agencies.
 Under a market system, millions of small producers and consumers must be free to buy or sell wherever the price is most attractive.
 This requires a vast proliferation of small goods transporters in the private sector, which are rare in many countries today.
 The large freight transport monopolies have to be replaced by entrepreneurial companies with small fleets competing for freight business.
 Immediate steps are needed to expand capacity and introduce competition in this vital sector by promoting the development of private road transport companies at the national, regional and local level.
 Special loan and leasing programmes should be established to enable small firms and individuals to purchase vehicles and pay for them out of the revenues generated from use.

 Their family room had a pool table and a stereo.
 While most of us played eight-ball or listened to Sunday‚Äôs dad, Ivan, an engineer, explain how things worked, Eric listened to the Messiah.
 I knew he loved Christmas, which was near.

 When she was less happy with me, she tended to focus more on just how stubborn I could be.
 It wasn't always obvious what would set off a bout of 'stiff neck' as she referred to it, but the only people who'd ever successfully talked me into a 'reasonable, rational' response had been Dad and Cindi.

The months went by slowly for him as he worked for no income as interns do.
 They fed him and they housed him and they educated him.
 He had his ups and downs but he embraced his goal to help others who were afflicted by addiction as he was.
 He started in detox, which was fitting, as it is exactly where he began.
 It was a dirty job that we knew all too well.
 He described how he rubbed the backs of the young men who vomited and comforted them as they reeled in pain from withdrawals.
 He remembered the video of himself and the comparison was obvious.
 From there Brandon went through every stage of the program as an intern instead of a student.
 Brandon even took incoming calls from parents who had children that they were attempting to get into rehab, just as we had called when we were desperate to find our son a place that would help him.

 I followed Emily, with Jason and Seth on my heels.
 When we reached the blocked cave entrance, Seth drew his sword and sliced the vines apart.
 They fell to the ground and the cave was revealed.
 We walked inside the dimly lit space and I sighed in relief at some safety.
 The air smelled musty and I had a feeling no one had ever been here.
 I sat on the floor next to Emily and the boys sat on the opposite side of the floor.

At some point I transitioned from just crying to having a full-blown panic attack.
 It should've terrified me that something new was bringing on an episode, but it was like there was so much else going wrong I couldn't spare any more emotional energy.
 I came out of the attack and remained on the floor thinking about all of the good times I'd had with Dad and Cindi.
 The memories should have made me feel better, but they had the opposite effect.
 I felt the tears start again as I realized all that goodness and joy was gone from my life forever.
 As my immunity started to wear off, I gratefully surrendered to the next attack, and the blissful relief it represented.
 I knew I was on track to drop back into the funk that'd robbed me of the weeks immediately after they died, but I was still strangely numb in the parts that should have cared.
 It seemed like I was on my third iteration, but it might have been the fourth or fifth.
 I was too detached to care.
 The knock on the door at least brought me back to myself enough to wonder how long I'd been on the floor.

It wouldn't last.
 Eventually the sun would clear the hills, and we'd be headed for eighty-plus degrees, but I could at least enjoy the next hour or so without worrying I was going to melt right out of my clothes.
 Walking down the lane, I tried to decide whether or not I wanted Brandon to show up today.
 After my mixed signals yesterday I figured there was a better than even chance he'd 'forget' to come get me.
 Strangely enough that didn't bother me as much as I thought it would.
 It was like walking down the lane managed to put things back in perspective for me.
 How could I be put out about something I hadn't ever actually believed was possible?
 I almost refused to believe my eyes when I came around the bend in our lane and saw a black Mustang parked on the side of the road.
 Brandon stood up from where he'd been leaning against the sports car and flashed me a blinding smile.
 He moved towards me with a casual grace that made little shivers run through me despite my earlier decision not to let his interest, or lack thereof, affect me.

Harruq stepped in front of Qurrah and then turned, staring down a group of five heavily armored guards.
 Swords and clubs hung from their belts, though a fifth carried a weapon neither of them had ever seen before.
 It was a wooden stick with a bulbous gem on one end.
 ‚ÄúYou stop when asked or pay the price,‚Äù said one of the guards.
 ‚ÄúIf he can even understand us,‚Äù said another.
 ‚ÄúWe understand perfectly,‚Äù Qurrah said, stepping to one side.
 ‚ÄúWhat has my brother done to warrant your attention?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre on a quest,‚Äù said the man wielding the strange weapon.
 He had a stubbly beard and a hooked nose with a thick scar along the top.

 Doctor ‚Äì (startled) I am writing notes on your fascinating case, it‚Äôs a thing that we doctors do you know.
 Ya, we doctors write notes all the time, in fact I am writing them now.
 Character 1- (reaches for the clipboard) May I see the notes?
 Doctor ‚Äì (slaps the incoming hand, and clutches the clip-board to his chest) Nein!
 These are confidential, and, uhhhh, it would violate the doctor-patient relationship if I allowed you or anyone to see them.

The only positive comment Lisa could make was, ‚Äúat least it runs.‚Äù I taught both of my boys to drive a stick shift on this beat up Chevelle before my eldest and I began to take it completely apart in an attempt to restore this classic car to its original condition with a hot rod twist.
 The deeper we dug into it, the more rust and damage we found.
 There were so many holes rusted through the bottom we could see the garage floor through the trunk.
 We removed every wire, rubber seal, window felt, and had boxes full of zip-lock baggies that were marked with a Sharpie what the part was and where it had come from.
 When Brandon was about fifteen, we went to Hot August Nights in Reno, a huge hot rod auto show.
 We wandered through these aisles of incredible cherry vehicles and talked about how someday ours could be alongside these beauties.
 This project would prove to be a huge challenge that would last seven-plus years, partly because it coincided with the start of Brandon‚Äôs drug use.
 What started as a project he was very enthusiastic about became an afterthought to time with friends and partying.
 He would show up for certain monumental events like when we put the body back on the frame after it was painted, but I was pretty much on my own with it for a bit.
 My wife was a champ as ‚Äúthat thing‚Äù (her nick-name for it) sat in a million pieces in the garage for so long.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll name him Steed,‚Äù I announced proudly.
 Chevelle pressed his eyes closed, shaking his head as I patted the horse‚Äôs neck once more.
 Chapter Eight Mountains
 We rode through the morning hours.
 Chevelle seemed content not to talk, but I was wound up in anguish, trying to decide whether I was brave enough to ask him questions.
 I had no idea how much he would put up with before he called it all off and hauled me back to the village for sentencing.
 Our path became more defined, pushing us through trees and between rocks, trailing upward so minutely I didn‚Äôt even realize until I glanced back and saw the base of the mountains beneath us.
 I appraised the narrow path ahead, snaking high through a vast rock-strewn mountain, and turning back didn‚Äôt seem so bad after all.
 Fists clenched, I pushed out the question I‚Äôd been most concerned about asking.
 I was so tied up, it twisted into an accusation.

"Well I hope you'll like it here."
 "Wait, what's this for?"
 The grin was back, and his teeth were still perfect.
 "I just made you spill yours, it's only fair."
 Brandon nodded at Britney, who stood there with her mouth slightly open, as he walked away.
 After a second or two of both of us staring blankly after Brandon, Britney grabbed me by the hand, the one holding the new, unopened water bottle, and pulled me over to a table in the corner.
 "Oh my gosh, you just poured water all over Brandon Worthingfield the Third.
 And then he talked to you.
 This is¬†so¬†incredible."
 I more or less fell into my seat, staring at my new bottle of water as Britney's chatter poured over me.

She wished she could wear her sneakers, she mused as she roamed through the garden in her bulky black shoes.
 But she couldn't very well walk into her house wearing shorts and sneakers.
 She did, however, have on black lace underwear that she'd gotten at the mall.
 No one would know about that, and it would be a reminder of her adventure in 2011.
 She wandered full circle and, for the first time, wasn't disappointed when she saw Rick's fountain.
 He stood up when he saw her, and she walked into his arms.
 "What do I need to do to get ready for Hollywood?"
 she asked, rubbing her cheek against his shoulder.
 She spent the day washing and ironing and folding clothes and cleaning the house.
 While the lasagna she'd made for dinner baked, she made a list of what she wanted to buy the next day.

Darkness crept at the corner of his sight.
 His strength was fading fast, and he had little doubt that if he passed out he would never wake.
 He struggled to lift a single numb hand, then flopped it down on top of the dead elf‚Äôs leg.
 Qurrah took as deep a breath as he dared and then spoke the words of a spell.
 Each syllable was slow torture, garbled in blood and born of pain most horrid.
 Thankfully, the spell was not complicated, and the words were few.
 He finished the spell mere seconds before his mind succumbed to the sleep that crawled at his eyes.
 Even though he was dead, life energy still swirled inside the elf‚Äôs body.
 Normally this energy would be consumed by the earth in burial, but Qurrah had other plans.
 His spell took in this life energy through his hand, filling his body with it, healing his wounds and clearing his mind.

It was bigger than the dragon we had rode.
 It had the body of a huge cockroach but its tail was a giant stinger.
 Large, bat wings were holding it up in the air.
 ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù I asked.
 I turned to Emily and said, ‚ÄúEmily, you know anything about this creature?‚Äù She looked pale.
 ‚ÄúIt's saying, 'Kill half-lings, kill and eat.
 '‚Äú ‚ÄúWell, you better tell it that it's going to have to starve this time because it's not going to be eating anything,‚Äù Seth said confidently and held his sword out.
 She shook her head.
 ‚ÄúThere is no way that I'm going to say that.‚Äù ‚ÄúJazell, can you see its weakness?‚Äù Seth called to me.
 I squinted at the creature, and saw a dark circle under its belly.

‚ÄúAre you crazy?‚Äù asked Audrian at the same time as Rodregas said, ‚ÄúThat is crazy.‚Äù ‚ÄúLook, the Guild will be after me,‚Äù Rodregas stated.
 ‚ÄúIt will not be safe to travel in my company,‚Äù he added.
 ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù stated the Hellborn in a voice that was so deep it was like stones grinding.
 ‚ÄúBut still, I would travel with you.‚Äù Again he made the statement and showed no interest in explaining his action.
 ‚ÄúActually,‚Äù added Imeralda shaking her long curly hair behind her as if to clear the way for her decision, ‚ÄúI was thinking the same thing.
 I am not safe from the Guild anyhow.
 My natural magical talent is very strong, and until I am better skilled in it, I am very vulnerable,‚Äù she stated ‚ÄúAnd frankly, while Audrian, Brit and Geor are very brave to let me travel with them, I fear that I put their lives in danger.
 You, on the other hand, are in more danger than I am, and should be even more motivated to stay out of the sight of the Guild.‚Äù After saying the little speech that she had clearly been practicing in her head, she added, ‚ÄúJoining you makes sense.‚Äù Rodregas hesitated, but she had an excellent point, and of course turning away such a beautiful young woman was a difficult thing to do.
 She did have a point and he did have a reasonably safe place to hide that he had been heading toward.
 So, even if he did head out on a raid of the Immortalists, she should be safe enough.

The void was reluctant to let me go, stripping me of memories and experiences as I fought my way free.
 By the time I was near surfacing I no longer remembered just how much I'd wanted to stay.
 Britney was pacing back and forth when I opened my eyes.
 She had her cell phone out and was looking like she wanted to dial 911, but was worried about the possible fallout.
 I was on the ground, which for some reason made me more irritable than it should have.
 Didn't she realize how hard it was to make it over to someone before collapsing like that?
 It kind of defeated the whole point if they then put you on the ground where your clothes would take their normal, instantaneous-collapse beating.

 I wasn't sure what to do."

Fannie had authority over me, but I wasn‚Äôt a child.
 It was only that I had nowhere else to go.
 That I couldn‚Äôt leave.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll need to learn protection spells.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt tell Francine or the Council,‚Äù he promised, and I didn‚Äôt miss that he‚Äôd used Fannie‚Äôs real name.
 Then, softer, ‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt even tell Junnie.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt understand.
 The cold, wet ground seeped through the material covering my legs, and I shifted, fidgeting as I looked up at him.
 ‚ÄúI mean I can‚Äôt do magic, just useless stuff‚Ä¶ lighting candles‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThen we start with fire,‚Äù he said.
 Chevelle lowered his hand to mine and stood, pulling me up and toward the center of the clearing.
 When we‚Äôd distanced ourselves from the tree line, he stopped and turned back to me, still holding my right hand.
 My eyes followed his as he looked down at our clasped hands and a cool blue flame lit on my right sleeve.

I guess we're used to it.

 If she was shocked by that commercial, he'd have to be careful about what movies he let her watch.
 She sat spellbound until 10:00, drinking in the commercials as well as the program.
 "Is that the end of the picture?"
 she asked in disappointment as the closing credits appeared.
 "Yeah.
 Are you sleepy?"
 "No.

The only emotion he was certain of was confusion.
 So he walked and would walk for the rest of the morning, wishing there was something he could do to banish the sick, hollow feeling in his stomach.
 There was nothing he knew to do though, and that made it so much worse.

 Their sparring ended, Harruq and Aurelia sat side-by-side against a tree, both glistening with sweat.
 ‚ÄúGetting better,‚Äù the half-orc said.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to be beating my ass in a few weeks if you keep learning as fast as you are.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù she said, patting his hand.

‚ÄúAnd you didn‚Äôt trust me with her.‚Äù The formation broke as Steed came to stand beside me, the corner of his mouth tipping into a grin.
 I stared at the group.
 I had no idea who they were, but from the way they spoke it was apparently no secret I was Chevelle‚Äôs prisoner.
 Or his property.
 ‚ÄúFrey,‚Äù Chevelle said, ‚Äúthis is Anvil.‚Äù He nodded toward a giant of a man who bowed his head respectfully.
 ‚ÄúAnd Grey.‚Äù The wiry man bent and straightened, his movements too quick.
 I drew in a startled breath as two more figures came into view.
 A pair of slender elves stepped in sync as they stopped just outside the group.
 They were tall and lean, dressed in robes the color of ash that only accentuated their shocking silver hair.
 I was convinced the moonlight must have been exaggerating it.

She slid the false wall back in place and grabbed my arm again, our heavy cloaks moving like shadows as we ran from the village.
 We didn‚Äôt go far before she stopped and jerked me into a squat beside her.
 There was movement a brief distance ahead, a rabbit weaving from the cover of one rock to the next.
 As I watched, a stick shot from the ground and speared the animal through the chest, killing it instantly.
 I gasped.
 Ruby giggled at me.
 She grabbed her quarry and we rushed back to the house.
 We went to the main room and she started a fire as she easily skinned and gutted the animal.
 The entrails went into an urn beside the fire and I wondered what she used them for before remembering all the containers on her bedroom shelf with a shudder.
 She stretched the pelt to dry while the meat cooked.

You can call me‚Ä¶,‚Äù he thought for a minute, making it obvious he was making up a fake name.
 He did not want to use his real name.
 He thought to himself, ‚ÄúWho do I want to be?‚Äù ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm going to try to fight against the Immortalists, then some sort of name fit for a Celestial Paladin, or maybe one fit for an Infernal adversary was needed,‚Äù he thought with a smile.
 The only way he could have survived the ceremony would have been divine intervention, so he said the first thing that came to mind, ‚ÄúYou can call me Sir Paladin, that will work for now,‚Äù he said it with a smile and a slight snicker at his own joke.
 ‚ÄúJust what kind of Paladin would you be?‚Äù Imeralda asked him.
 ‚ÄúWhy, it should be obvious to you more than anyone,‚Äù Rodregas said with a slight bow to the beautiful half AElf.
 ‚ÄúThe kind of heroic Paladin that rescues beautiful maidens in distress and frees‚Äô innocent prisoners from the dungeons of evil sorcerers.‚Äù Rodregas could not help but smile at his own line.
 He had always found that a good joke was like a good insult; the best always had enough truth in them to sting.
 Geor smiled, but the others seemed not to have appreciated his little joke.
 The AElf maiden just looked at Rodregas quietly and thoughtfully.

Even before I'd gotten old enough to attend Prom, I'd still invariably spent the day grouchy and depressed.
 Things only got worse as I'd aged, presumably because I wasn't really as indifferent as I liked to pretend, and I couldn't hide behind the excuse of being too young to be asked anymore.
 My pulse had already skyrocketed; I almost didn't hear what Rachel was saying over the pounding in my ears.
 "...of course it's still a little ways away, but a girl like Britney starts early so she gets as high up the social food chain as possible."
 Rachel's words calmed me a little at the same time they sparked confusion.
 I'd never heard her be quite so cynical.
 It was completely at odds with the innocent, accepting exterior she usually displayed.
 My surprise must have leaked through.
 Almost as soon the thought crossed my mind Rachel's demeanor crossed back from the older, jaded visage, to one that was more youthful, even embarrassed.
 "Sorry, I know she's your friend.

 She put on all her 1927 clothes, even the stockings that she‚Äôd stopped wearing once she‚Äôd gotten used to her comfortable 2011 clothes.
 She headed for the stairs but then stopped.
 Quietly she approached Rick‚Äôs door and opened it just a little.
 Rick was sprawled on his back, a sheet covering him from the waist down.
 Tears filled her eyes.
 She‚Äôd miss him so much.
 The sky was turning a dark gray when she walked into the garden.

Again that incredible smile flashed across his face.
 "They were touch and go for a little bit, but I'm most pleased with how everything worked out."
 I'd spent all of Monday in a daze, and felt much the same now, only this time it was a daze of good fortune.
 It hardly bothered me when Britney snubbed me during English.
 I flew through my Algebra assignment, finishing up the one from yesterday as well as the one Mrs. Campbell assigned, before the bell rang to release us.
 The only thing that even threatened my bubble of happiness was when I walked into the lunchroom and saw that Britney was sitting with the cheerleaders who'd come and sat at our table yesterday.
 It was blatantly obvious I wasn't welcome.
 Unsure where to sit, I almost spun around and walked back into the hall until Brandon caught my eye and waved me over.
 I had to detour around the tangle of tables that belonged to the closest thing Sanctuary had to real Goths.
 My wandering path brought me around to where I could see what I'd mentally dubbed 'Alec's corner'.

I'd had enough pity from my mom to last years.
 "You bet.
 Think they bought it?"
 I tried to inject the proper amount of blonde stupidity into my words, but wasn't sure it worked until I felt Alec's arms tighten almost painfully around me.
 I gasped, and he set me down so quickly I almost fell over.
 Before I'd even regained my balance, he was walking away, moving so quickly I would've needed to run to keep up.
 Even so, he hadn't turned away quick enough to hide the complete disdain in his expression.
 I suddenly found myself wishing I'd told him the truth rather than making him think I was stupid and manipulative.
 It was too late.
 He was already out of sight, and by now his opinion of me was fixed.

Well, before her marriage, anyway.
 He‚Äôd bet that she‚Äôd been a lot less complicated than the women he knew.
 And she was so beautiful.
 Rick went to bed without having decided anything about an outfit for the dance.
 But for some reason, the young woman from the 1920s was still very much on his mind.
 CHAPTER THREE
 "I said no!"
 Marie stared at her betrothed.
 All she wanted to know was why they couldn't at least have dinner together tonight.
 He'd said he had to work, but it was Friday, and he had to eat anyway.

"This isn't the time; we need to get you back home to your mom.
 It would be most unfortunate if she were to arrive and find you gone."
 My mind was still a little fuzzy, but it was working well enough for me to know he was wrong.
 "No.
 She's not going to be home until Sunday.
 There isn't any reason to go back there yet."
 I looked around for Rachel, but she'd disappeared sometime between when I'd started falling, and when I'd thought to thank her.
 "You mean she wasn't planning on coming back until Sunday.
 Once Brandon gets involved in things, they tend not to go as expected."

 ‚ÄúPleased to meet you,‚Äù Harruq said with a bow.
 ‚ÄúIndeed,‚Äù Qurrah said, his hand itching to retrieve his whip curled underneath his raggedy robe.
 ‚ÄúIf you are thieves, you are certainly incompetent ones,‚Äù Ahrqur said, his voice full of contempt.
 He descended halfway down the stairs, his eyes never leaving the two.
 ‚ÄúOf course, what could one expect from Celestia‚Äôs cursed?‚Äù

Rodregas looked into Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs eyes.
 He was resolute.
 Rodregas felt humbled at the man‚Äôs bravery, at his passion, at his strength.
 Rodregas knew there was no such thing as a hero,  simply people that sometimes choose to do the right thing when it was a hard choice.
 There was no question for Doi‚Äôvan, he simply stood quiet and ready.
 He knew what the right thing was, and he therefore took the right action.
 Rodregas was not Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs equal in spirit, but he knew that though he would likely die that he could not turn away from the Hellborn‚Äôs example.
 Rodregas then turned to Imeralda, her eyes told a different story.
 She both wanted to run fast and far and she wanted to try to free the Nymphs.
 Simply stated, she was scared.

More than anything else, that was what finally shook me from my reverie.
 He was already talking.
 "...wanted to talk to you about what happened today."
 Part of me wanted to wait and see what he was going to say, to lose myself in what was sure to be a very convincing lie designed to make him look good, and me feel like I was on heroin for however long he favored me with his presence.
 Luckily that idealistic, stupid part of me had seen too many girls get used by smooth-talking boys.
 I interrupted right away.
 "You mean when your sister nearly got beaten by that whore, and you not only didn't do anything, you stopped your friends from doing anything either."
 Alec flinched a little.
 I was a little surprised by how satisfying it was to have him, a demigod, on the run, but I didn't let it slow me down.
 "The fact that I, a little waif from out of town, could defuse the situation and save Rachel no doubt sticks in your craw, which explains why you're lurking around out here waiting to talk to me.

These concerns motivated and were symbolized by the institution of the World Food Prize in 1987.
 It was in this context that, on World Food Day in October 1988, a small group met in Washington DC and proposed the launching of a new initiative to utilize the growing consensus over food to press for more rapid and substantial progress on peace, disarmament and development.
 Without peace there could be no stable basis or fertile soil for development, without development there could be no lasting and assured peace.
 The inextricable linkage between war and famine, economic dislocation and unemployment, violence and social in stability, fleeing refugees and migrating populations, high military spending and growing indebtedness argued compellingly against any uni-dimensional approach to resolving the problems of peace and development.
 In the rapprochement between the superpowers we saw an opportunity that demanded new perspectives, new attitudes and new approaches.
 In constituting its membership, the Commission has brought together a highly diverse group of political leaders, scientists, economists, government administrators and businessmen, drawn from industrial and developing nations, with a wide range of experience in presiding over government ministries, administrative departments and agencies, international development and research institutions, prominent non-governmental agencies and private companies.
 The first official plenary meeting of ICPF was held in Trieste, Italy, in October 1989, within a few days of the fall of the Berlin Wall.
 Over taken by the staggering pace of developments arising from the end of the Cold War, the world was being altered almost beyond recognition.
 Our ambition to slow the arms race appeared suddenly insignificant in the light of unfolding events.
 While we contemplated strategy, COMECON and the Warsaw Pact were breaking up, the USSR began to dissolve, democratic institutions began to spread, and command economies started transforming themselves into free market systems.

"Do you want me to call in sick?"

One of the most important is the pretense that nobody knows just how hard it is sometimes for her to be the only human in a house full of shape shifters."

 As badly as it hurts each time she sneaks away, it hasn't happened nearly as often since you got here.
 She's been improving ever since you moved into town, and the rate of change has increased over the last two weeks."
 "I suppose we make quite the pair, her and I.

As I glanced up at him, it struck me how close we were.
 My hand dropped from my face to fall against his chest.
 That didn‚Äôt help.
 Heat rose in my neck; I could feel the corded muscle beneath his shirt.
 I had to look away.
 He must have thought I was searching for Junnie.
 ‚ÄúShe left just after dawn, when she knew you were safe.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I breathed.

Qurrah searched the line, and he saw what he suspected.

 ‚ÄúHuh,‚Äù Harruq said.

 The man in black robes lifted his hand.

I just stared out my window at the light the previous owners had mounted on a pole.
 It was just close enough to see an amazingly thick cloud of insects swirl around it, captivated by the artificial glow.
 When I walked downstairs I found Mom's camping equipment piled in the living room.
 For all I'd tossed and turned, I must have gotten some sleep to have not heard her come in.
 I contemplated jotting down a note before just shrugging and skipping outside, happy for once to be shivering.
 It wouldn't last.
 Eventually the sun would clear the hills, and we'd be headed for eighty-plus degrees, but I could at least enjoy the next hour or so without worrying I was going to melt right out of my clothes.
 Walking down the lane, I tried to decide whether or not I wanted Brandon to show up today.
 After my mixed signals yesterday I figured there was a better than even chance he'd 'forget' to come get me.
 Strangely enough that didn't bother me as much as I thought it would.

It's amazing how a near complete loss of physical control can burn through your energy reserves.
 Alec frowned.
 "I'm sorry.
 I forget sometimes how much easier it is for you and Rachel to catch a chill.
 Let's get you inside where it's a bit more temperate."
 It seemed like such a waste, leaving the grotto after all the work that'd been put into transforming it, but Alec waved away my protests.
 He easily cradled me in one arm, while carefully picking up my painting with his free hand.
 A short time later, we were back inside the house and headed towards his room.
 Cuddled up against his chest with the familiar, warm tingle caressing my skin, my system apparently decided I was completely safe, and started shutting down.
 I was doing a fairly respectable job of hiding my drooping eyelids, but all my efforts were undone by the prodigious yawn that ambushed me as he set me down on the bed.

‚ÄúI promise.
 Happy?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúFar from it.‚Äù
 Aurelia crossed her legs, tossed back her hair, and then leaned her head on her hands as she stared into the fire.
 ‚ÄúI want you to listen to me, alright Harruq?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù
 He glanced down, uncomfortable and saddened that Aurelia refused to look him in the eye.
 ‚ÄúVelixar is not who you think he is.
 He isn‚Äôt _what_ you think he is.
 He tried to kill me, Harruq.

The punishments he had dealt some were horrible and some simply funny or embarrassing.
 A few times he had even driven Gods to join the fallen Daemon Lords in the Infernal Realm.
 But the All-Father did not kill any of these other challengers.
 It was his duty to support the Pantheon, even when they betrayed him.
 Yet his reaction to this newly created god, this incredibly powerful, magic-wielding new immortal, was to simply kill him; and that was the end of it.
 Centuries later, when the next Guild Master had ascended to the Celestial plane, she kept her ego in sharp check.
 The Sorceress Goddess Blodeuwedd was known for how helpful she was to the rest of the Pantheon, especially All√≥d.
 Rodregas had always assumed that this had been the point of killing Accerntorino; if mortals where going to become Celestial they would do so on the Celestials terms.
 He raised his hand up again and touched his face, feeling its strong, smooth, square jaw.
 The teeth were not the sore, crooked teeth that he had had to be so careful to chew with this morning.

 Qurrah stopped their progress by turning and placing his hands on his brother‚Äôs shoulders.
 His eyes burned into Harruq‚Äôs, so strong in force that the larger brother could not look away.
 ‚ÄúYou have done much for me without question, without pause.

 Now I don‚Äôt have very little control over Johnny, I wish I did, but I don‚Äôt.
 The only thing Johnny‚Äôs shaping up holds in common with winning the lottery is that the chances are slim and all I‚Äôll ever be able to do is fantasize about it.

I could see further into him than I ever could with Brandon, and there wasn't any deception there.
 I nodded, and then buried my face against his chest as I cried myself out.
 It was several minutes before I was able to speak again.
 "You're so ready to send me away it's hard to believe sometimes that you really want me here."
 Alec stroked the side of my face, ending by tucking a strand of hair back in place behind my ear.
 "I really want nothing as badly as I want you here.
 If I were to be completely selfish I'd never have even made the offer, but that wouldn't have been fair to you."
 I snuggled closer to him.
 "Well, I just want to log my vote for you to be more selfish."
 Alec's dry chuckle hinted at old hurts.

 The body of Ahrqur Tun‚Äôdel lay atop several strange markings and shapes drawn in the dirt.

 The wrappings provided a bit of relief against the growing smell of death that already permeated their home.

A few hours later it was starting to get dark as Rodregas recognized the spot and turned the wagon left for the final hard assent.
 At this point there was no trail, and common sense would have argued against the path.
 It was hard work.
 The horses had to be hand-led around rocks and trees and pulled up.
 Doi‚Äôvan and Rodregas had to manhandle the wagon around a few corners which was easier to do than it should have been, but Celestial and Hellborn strength together made short work of it.
 Then, as they finally started to level out into the small little valley of the hollow, the hair all over Rodregas‚Äô body suddenly stood up on end and his skin shivered.
 Rodregas was expecting it, but was a little shocked by the strength of his reaction.

The End of the World
 During summer before our senior year, Eric worked as lifeguard at Carmen Ranch Club.
 The first few weeks, on his days off, we hung out at La Jolla Shores.
 While Eric worked, I often helped Cliff and Bill Torrey and their dad rebuild a ‚Äô56 Thunderbird.
 Sometimes I visited my cousin Jill at her Pacific Beach apartment.
 Jill was nineteen.
 One Friday evening, she hosted a party.
 I drank several beers, then invited somebody who reminded me of Karen Flagstad to join me for a cruise up the coast road to La Jolla.
 Her name was Kris.
 She would go with me, she said, if not for a babysitting job she had that night.

I wondered what prison would be like for Brandon and wished he were in prison because at least we‚Äôd know where he was; he wouldn‚Äôt be a drug addict wandering the streets.
 Strange irony, that.
 Strange feeling it stirred in me, realizing that my intervention to keep Brandon out of prison could backfire so terribly.
 Before he got help now, he would need to hit rock bottom.
 Hopefully he‚Äôd survive it.
 Then, one day Thomas called.
 Brandon just contacted him from some street corner in a bad part of town outside of San Diego.
 Brandon said he was broke, addicted, alone and ready to commit himself to rehab.
 Thomas said he had dropped what he was doing and was driving directly to find him, as he knew Brandon might change his mind.
 Thomas said that most drug addicts would take every drug they could get their hands on if they knew they were going to rehab, and this was dangerous.

I could feel my heartbeat climbing, slamming away at my ribs with all the energy of a full-blown panic attack, but I wasn't dizzy, just scared.
 The cafeteria workers had all turned around so their backs were facing us, a sight which kindled the first spark of anger, an emotion that burned brighter because of the fear still coursing through me.
 There was a gasp as Cassie shoved Rachel, a misleadingly casual motion that sent the smaller girl stumbling back into Alec's chest hard enough to leave bruises.
 The typical catcalls were still absent, it was as if nobody viewed this as a normal fight, like there was somehow more at stake.
 I'd been waiting for someone to intervene on Rachel's behalf.
 It was obvious she knew nothing about fighting.
 Cassie wasn't the kind of girl to fight just to prove a point and then forget about the incident afterwards.
 Just looking at her, I knew she'd remember any slight for as long as she lived, and she had enough influence in the school to make just about anyone's life miserable.
 She probably got away with things just because nobody was willing to cross her.
 Rachel was going to get hurt.

As his sword struck her staff, the sparring began.
 Aurelia was familiar with her staff, the wood comfortable in her grip.
 She had no sense of tactic, though, and all it took was a quick feint or two before she left herself horribly open.
 Harruq used only one sword, running it in slow circles, stabs, and the occasional feint.
 He enjoyed the steady workout but savored even more watching Aurelia move gracefully through the air.
 Whenever his eyes lingered too long, however, he‚Äôd feel the sharp sting of Aurelia‚Äôs staff against his arms or chest.
 When they finished, Harruq slumped onto his rear and rubbed his bruises.
 ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt be able to hit you,‚Äù Aurelia said as she sat across from him, her legs tucked underneath her.
 ‚ÄúYeah, so?‚Äù Harruq asked.

I was just beginning to doubt whether I‚Äôd seen him at all when I spotted him standing across the circle, grinning fiendishly while he dangled an object from his hands.
 It was the feather Ruby had tied in my hair.
 I‚Äôd forgotten about it.
 I reached up to feel for it and it was gone.
 I started to get irritated but then the feather was in my other hand and he was back, his hands now empty.
 And then, for no apparent reason but amusement, he did a few somersaults and landed in the center of the circle, smiling.
 I could only shake my head as Ruby clapped beside me, clearly thrilled with the show.
 I thought I must have missed something.
 Grey bowed out of the circle and was replaced by the two tall, silvery elves.
 I found myself startled again; I had not seen them sitting with the group, or anywhere else.

The change had been so abrupt and surreal.
 But now she knew that she would have adapted.

I tried to listen, but exhaustion won out and their words began to meld into dreams.
 I could hear them as I was drifting, floating in a great shadowed lake.
 My white gown spread around me in the water, now-dark hair swaying with the ripples on the surface.
 I rose above, peering down at myself, and the image turned into my mother, the dark water going black, the ripples transforming to wind.
 I recognized the scene as her pendant began to glow, the wind howling, screams piercing my ears.
 It was the same dream, but different now.
 I glanced around to find a village I didn‚Äôt know.
 Someone was coming toward me, an expression of fear and sadness on his handsome face.
 His familiar face.
 He reached out to me and I stepped toward him, tears streaming down my cheeks.

 Although the ostensible goal of transition has been to economies based on private ownership, three years after the initiation of transition programmes, very little privatization has actually taken place in most countries of the region.
 It is widely believed that acceleration of this process will lead to rising unemployment and a widening gap between the rich and the poor, leading to the creation of a huge under class that had been virtually eradicated in previous decades.
 Is this result really the best these countries can hope for in the foreseeable future?
 The events in Eastern Europe have been widely hailed as a victory for democratic capitalism over authoritarian communism.
 The obvious failure of the latter has been used to support the claim of the former to be the sole political and economic heir to the next millennium.
 This view has been applied to justify the imposition of radical shock therapy on the unsuspecting and unprepared populations of Eastern Europe and stringent structural adjustment programmes on many developing countries.
 But the claim itself is based on a limited and superficial interpretation of history.
 The fall of the Berlin Wall marks the end of a confrontation between two divergent systems that have been struggling toward reconciliation throughout the present century ‚Äì one based on the human right to freedom and the determinism of the free market, the other based on the right to basic economic security and the determinism of the state.

Harruq tried to smile, but a sob came out instead.
 He hugged her, his forehead pressed against hers.

 She leaned all her weight against him, and such close contact only deepened his guilt and anger.

Second, every possible step must be taken to provide education for female children, an essential requirement for social equity and quality of life improvement.
 Nearly two-thirds of the world‚Äôs illiterate are women.
 In the poorest developing countries, literacy rates among females are 40 per cent below rates for males and the average number of years of schooling for females is 60 per cent lower.
 But perceptible progress has been made.
 Between 1980 and 1990, female primary school enrolment rose from 44 per cent to 47 per cent of total enrolment, although it actually declined in the Arab states and remained virtually unchanged in South Asia.
 Uneducated females represent a huge reservoir of untapped human potential that must be given every opportunity and full assistance to develop their innate capacities.
 This will call for accelerated efforts to establish cr√®che and child-care facilities, abolish child labour, and remove gender bias from text books and educational institutions.
 The cost of raising female educational levels up to that of males worldwide has been estimated at $2.5 billion, a small amount for an initiative that could have such wide-ranging benefits.
 Third, literacy must be complemented by techniracy, education that imparts basic technical information and skills to the population through a variety of teaching methods suited to the educational level of the recipients.
 Detailed recommendations are presented in the next section of this chapter.

 Steed, Anvil, and Grey greeted us before we resumed training.
 I tried to keep my mind off the wolves, off the reason we were training, off the encounter with Chevelle, off all of the terrible things it kept returning to, and I was grateful for the fog that clouded my thoughts.
 Though I wasn‚Äôt exactly winning matches, I was getting better.

Everything was presented in a way that made it seem like accomplished fact when in reality it was all theory.
 It was based on Einstein's theory of relativity.
 These wormholes Marie had mentioned were passages formed around black holes, which were collapsed stars.
 And it was all based on the assumption that something besides light could travel at the speed of light.
 In one small paragraph he found that the entire article was theory upon theory: no one had ever found a black hole or a wormhole or anything that could travel faster than the speed of light.
 "You didn't miss anything," Rick told Marie, setting the article aside.
 "Scientists think that it would be possible to travel through time by going through these wormholes the author mentions, but it's all theory.
 Nobody has ever discovered a wormhole, and none of this stuff has ever been proven."

It has been amply proved that the authoritarian state is incapable of exerting a benevolent authority over the people without imposing severe restrictions on freedom, stifling human energy and creativity, leading sooner or later to rising discontent and a loss of social vitality.
 It is also abundantly clear that money as an institution operating through the free pricing mechanism of the market system ‚Äì although it does succeed in generating high levels of energy, creativity and productivity ‚Äì regards people as a purchasable commodity or a potential market, but is otherwise indifferent to human values and welfare.
 Neither the determinism of the state nor the determinism of the market can be adequate in themselves to achieve the goals of peace and prosperity that we strive after.
 It has been generally assumed that the transition now taking place in Eastern Europe will sooner or later lead these countries to adopt forms of government and economy identical to those prevalent in the West.
 But for those raised in a society that offered a great measure of social security, the poverty and insecurity of the Western system are gross inadequacies.
 While it is clear that these new democracies have rejected the authoritarian statist system, it is not yet clear what finally they will accept, discover or invent as a more acceptable alternative.
 The creativity and inventiveness they have exhibited in seeking an alternative in the past may quite possibly lead them to discover that better social system which both East and West are in need of.
 Viewed from an evolutionary perspective, we may surmise the general direction and likely destination of that quest.
 The requirements of the state and the market must eventually give way to the needs of people.
 The values of authority and money must be supplanted by acceptance of the fundamental value of the human being.

She added the last bullet; Toad Dwarf said to Jason, ‚ÄúHe will destroy all half-ling.‚Äù What does ‚Äúhalf-ling mean?
 ‚ÄúDid the dwarfs tell you anything?‚Äù I asked, taking the paper.
 None of what she wrote on the paper made any sense to me.
 She shook her head.
 ‚ÄúNo and if they did, I was too busy trying to burn them to hear them.‚Äù She took the paper back.
 ‚ÄúWell I think the only thing we‚Äôve established is that toad dwarves are crazy.‚Äù Seth said.

It was eerie quiet and as I stood there it felt like I had never left the woods.
 I heard a voice whispering one word over and over again.
 ‚ÄúJazell...‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I called.
 ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù ‚ÄúJazell...‚Äù the voice whispered again.
 ‚ÄúJazell.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I screamed into the trees.
 ‚ÄúWhat do you want?
 Why do you have to repeat my name over and over again, it's creepy.‚Äù ‚ÄúJazell, beware,‚Äù it whispered again.
 ‚ÄúBeware.‚Äù I stomped my foot in frustration and yelled, ‚ÄúBeware of what?‚Äù ‚ÄúBeware,‚Äù it mumbled back.
 ‚ÄúBeware of the shadows.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I said, startled.

‚ÄúWhy did you save me?‚Äù
 He kicked his toes into the dirt, unable to piece together the chaotic mess inside his head and heart.
 All he could think of was what his brother had told him to do.
 ‚ÄúQurrah said to kill you if I didn‚Äôt love you‚Ä¶‚Äù
 ‚ÄúYet you didn‚Äôt,‚Äù she said.
 Harruq nodded, but said nothing else.
 ‚Äú _Hana fael!_ ‚Äù a voice cried from far down the alley.
 Both turned to see an elf raise his bow and fire.

‚ÄúI will keep my word, Antonil,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúFly back to the others, Sonowin, we will battle this day.‚Äù The horse snorted, making Dieredon laugh.
 ‚ÄúNo, I am sure you won‚Äôt be hurt.‚Äù Sonowin banked, giving the elf one last view of the battle before soaring east to where the rest of the Quellan elves waited atop their magnificent pegasi.
 His horse neighed a quick question, one Dieredon wished he could laugh at.
 ‚ÄúEveryone can be killed,‚Äù he said, tying his hair behind his head.
 ‚ÄúAnd no, I have no plans of breaking my ribs again.‚Äù
 The horse made an interesting little noise, one Dieredon had long ago learned was laughter.

The words felt hollow, nothing more than self-serving lies.
 He kept remembering the mother with her young babe clutched to her breast as she fled from him.
 When he had rammed her, she had tucked the child to guard it from the fall.
 Right before the kill, she had held him, trying to protect him.
 ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù he asked.
 A part of him worried he might wake his brother, but he was too drained to care.
 ‚ÄúWhy did she do that?
 She could have run faster without the child!‚Äù
 No, he knew that answer.
 She would not abandon her child just as he would not abandon Qurrah.

He had started his own church somewhere out West.

Antonil stumbled, pain flaring up his right leg.
 He forced himself to continue running.
 If he could close the gap, the bow would prove no match for his longsword.
 Another arrow struck an inch from his left foot.
 His leg was aflame, yet he continued to charge, pulling back his shield so his sword could lash out.
 But the elf was not close enough, and he was more skilled with a bow than in just firing arrows.
 He snapped the wood up, cracking Antonil across the bottom of his hand, which held firm to his blade.
 Undaunted, the elf stepped closer, ducked underneath the guard captain‚Äôs return swing, and then kicked at the arrow still lodged in his shin, finally making Antonil drop his blade.
 The elf stood, drawing an arrow as he did.
 Antonil, now lying on the ground, struggled to bring his shield over his chest.

They broke into a small clearing, and there in the center stood a cloaked figure, kneeling down as he turned a meat-covered spit.
 Pressed tight behind an oak tree, I shuffled sideways to get a better view.
 I was sure it was an elf, male, from his size.
 The smell of real food was consuming, and I was watching the cooked meat roll over the flame as I moved again.
 A dry leaf crushed beneath my foot.
 ‚ÄúCome then, there‚Äôs plenty for both of us,‚Äù the figure called.
 I cursed.
 Caught, I walked cautiously out of the trees.

Even taking into consideration his annoying efforts to protect me from the addictive effect of his touch, this was the happiest I'd ever been.
 I'd had plenty of bad times over the last year or so to offset the near perfection of my life now, but it still didn't seem like something that could last.
 We just sat there in silence with his arms wrapped around me for several minutes before his cell phone rang.
 Sometimes I wondered if the slim device was some kind of super spy phone.
 It seemed to get reception in some of the most incredible places.
 He shifted around just enough to answer it without letting go of me with his right arm.
 "What's up?"
 Whoever was on the other end was talking too quietly for me to make out more than the occasional word.
 "...Jack...now...no time..." I could suddenly feel the energy radiating off of Alec as his beast woke and rose to the surface.

Steed was watching me, smiling appreciatively, and I realized I was wearing a huge grin.
 And about three pounds of mud.
 The slower pace gave me time to take everything in.
 The ground had leveled off again, clearing to open meadows of low grass and a few scattered trees.
 Large gray rocks dotted the landscape.
 There was a haziness on the horizon but as we rode it began to clear, revealing a mammoth lake ahead.
 It was a hundred times bigger than the tiny forest ponds I was used to, as smooth as glass.
 Behind it the haze thinned just enough I could see the outline of mountains.
 The image was like a punch in the chest.

I trudged up the stairs, shut my door, and then realized I wasn't sure what to do with myself.
 I'd spent most of the time since we'd arrived either buried in homework, or borderline catatonic.
 The obvious choice was sitting on the rickety table next to my bed, but I wasn't sure if I was up to Les Mis√©rables right now.
 Maybe in a few weeks, once the production had left Vegas, I'd be ready to delve back into it.
 Right now it was just another reminder of how many things in my life I didn't have control over.
 No, that was right out.
 I thumbed through Pride and Prejudice for a few minutes, and then just gave up and headed to the bathroom.
 A short time later, teeth brushed and face washed, I swung my window wide open and climbed into bed.
 It would take hours for the air to cool down enough to start leeching some of the heat out of my room, but it was better than nothing.
 I'd at least sleep better for the second half of the night.

He kept his hair cropped short, not wanting to hide any part of the damage.
 And my mother, though my dreams gave her two names.
 Dark hair, blowing in the wind, arms outstretched, the pendant hanging at her neck glowing fiercely.
 Fire, flames, burning.
 And then water.
 Drowning.
 Over and over and over.
 It almost made the cliff dreams more bearable, to be away from the repetitive drowning.
 I swam around in these impressions for what seemed like an eternity.
 Eventually, they became so familiar they all started to seem like my dreams, not someone else‚Äôs.

In fact if you could just find us a couple of desks in the back corner you'll hardly know we're here."
 The look she shot me was so venomous for a second I thought my heart was going to stop.
 "Ms. Paige has an assigned seat towards the front of the class.
 Based on her scholastic performance to date it would be highly irresponsible of me as an educator to allow her to change seats."
 I was just far enough off to the side to watch as Alec's eyes very slowly and pointedly drifted down to stare at the note in her hands.
 For a second I wasn't sure she'd gotten the hint, but then those same hands clenched reflexively, nearly tearing the note before she caught herself and smoothed it back out.
 "Ms. Bellarose, please move up to Ms. Paige's old seat."
 Alec politely collected his note and led me to our seats.
 Any enjoyment I'd just experienced as a result of seeing one of my least-favorite teachers put in her place quickly soured as she started the class and launched into her usual barrage of questions designed to demonstrate my stupidity.
 Alec had apparently gotten under her skin even more than I'd realized.

Spinning into a tumble to keep from landing flat on my face, I rolled to my feet, still thrilling from the fire play.
 From magic.
 I let out a breathless laugh and Chevelle joined in, though in all fairness, he might have merely been amused by my fall.
 We spent the next several hours there in the meadow, sculpting my craft.
 The exercises grew increasingly more difficult, but it seemed Chevelle was only toying with me.
 He must have had experience with fire magic; the flames he produced behaved like an obedient dog.
 Mine, on the other hand, were about as compliant as a wet cat.
 Exhausted by the day‚Äôs work, I began to sway a bit.
 Chevelle led me to the base of an old willow tree and I slumped against the trunk, sliding down to lie on my back.
 Chevelle reclined against the tree, his legs coming to rest just above my head in the soft grass.

She was still whispering, but the words sheared through the darkness, arresting my fall.
 I didn't want him here, didn't want to give him another reason to despise me.
 What if Jasmin came with him?
 The thought of lying helpless with her in the same room sent shivers of cold sliding down me.
 I couldn't see, so I reached out, blindly trying to find the phone before Rachel could dial Alec.
 My questing hand finally found the tiny, hard-plastic package, and I grabbed on with all of my fading strength.
 The darkness was still beckoning, but alternating images of Jasmin and Alec flashed before my eyes.
 I was so confused that I couldn't make sense of the flood of emotions that accompanied the pictures, other than the fact that terror came to the forefront as they sped up.
 Faster and faster the two figures changed places, and then they disappeared.
 It was like my mind was a computer that'd overheated and had to reboot.

Her headache was so wicked, she grimaced and groaned.
 I tried to coax her to the doctor.
 She said he had already given her pain pills, which was all he could do.
 Then I came home from school and found her lying in a heap beside her bed.
 Breathing in shallow puffs, eyes open and watery.
 Above the right eye was a long gash, already scabbed over.
 I suspected a prowler had clubbed her and swiped her few items of jewelry.
 But she managed a goofy smile and mumbled that she must‚Äôve fallen, and getting up had seemed too hard to bother with.

Even here it is likely to come primarily from entrenched vested interests, not the general public.
 A mere tinkering with or modest amendment to the structure of the UN will only perpetuate the inherent inadequacies of the present system and postpone its maturation into a truly effective instrument for global political, economic and social integration and collective accomplishment.
 Many proposals are being floated to modify its workings, mostly by expanding representation on the Security Council.
 As an interim measure and first steps, the immediate addition of five more permanent members to the Security Council, based on the criteria of population and economic status, and the abolition of the veto power are fully justified.
 However, these changes do not go far enough in furthering the interests of global peace and development.
 They will not fundamentally alter the out-dated, non-representative structure which perpetuates the status quo.
 It is time to devise a new formula and a new structure for international governance that will reconcile and harmonize the political rights and economic interests of all the world‚Äôs peoples.
 The institution that had come to symbolize the Cold War must be restructured in such a manner as to symbolize the abolition of all war and the establishment of peace and democracy as the foundations for global development.

 She almost choked on her Slurpee, the first she'd ever had.
 "Where can I drive to?"
 "From one end of the parking lot to the other."
 "A parking lot?"
 "I'll take you to a big, empty parking lot somewhere and let you get the feel of it.
 When you feel comfortable, I might let you drive around some quiet neighborhoods, but you need to study the rules of the road so you can get a license.
 Then we'll see about trying out the streets downtown and the highways."

They were silvery robes, beautiful and decadent.
 The spirit wailed.
 It took all of Harruq‚Äôs strength to resist the urge to cover his ears.
 ‚ÄúCease such nonsense,‚Äù Qurrah ordered.
 The spirit immediately hushed.
 A bit of coherence came to his eyes, and he glared down at the half-orc.
 ‚ÄúGreetings, Ahrqur,‚Äù Qurrah said.

 The spirit glared harder.

A long, billowing black cloak spiraled out behind it, completely covering the rest of its body.
 Its eyes shined red and full of hate, although there was a terrible smile that danced on its face.
 ‚ÄúVICTORY!‚Äù It boomed in a chilling voice.
 The crowds of monsters roared in applause and excitement.
 The trolls banged their clubs on the ground, on their chests, and even on each other.
 The howl of a Frost Beast rose into the night, making me feel even more chilled.
 I wanted to wake up.
 But I couldn‚Äôt.
 I needed to find out what that thing was and what it had killed.
 I also had a horrible feeling, deep down that made me know that this wasn‚Äôt a dream but some type of vision.

I found myself outside the school, sitting on the edge of the parking lot without a clear idea how I'd ended up there.
 There was a vaguely irritating noise behind me that didn't seem to fit with what I expected from school.
 I thought about turning to see what it was, but was thankfully too far back into the gauze to act on the thought.
 I went back to contemplating the pair of ants that were currently trekking across my right foot.
 "Adriana.
 Are you okay?"
 My insides were too raw.
 Just coming out long enough to listen to Mrs. Campbell had opened everything back up.
 My mind tried to shy away, to sink away from the certainty of more jagged shards being shoved into me, but this voice was an important one.
 Rachel looked down at me, her arms wrapped around her waist as if trying to hold herself together.

I recognized Alec's humanoid form from before, a massive, black, heavily furred tower of muscle, claws and fangs.
 I might have pulled back at his approach, but the eyes, even with their vertical pupils were still undeniably his.
 A paler, more icy blue than I was used to, but it was still him looking out at me from the other side.
 Everyone else was harder to pick out, but I gave it my best shot.
 Isaac was probably the bluish-black hybrid who was nearly as big as Alec.
 His utter stillness in comparison to the constant motion of the rest of the pack was too much like his normal self-mastery for it to be anyone else.
 The other hybrid, the gray one with his teeth showing and just the barest hint of a growl had to be James.
 Jessica was obviously the smallest of the wolves.
 She paced back and forth, her eyes never leaving me as she made it entirely evident she'd like nothing more than to give into countless millennia of instincts, and just rip my throat out in a single lightning-fast bound.
 It wasn't until I tried to decide which of the two remaining wolves was Dominic, that I realized the next smallest figure wasn't a wolf at all.

Ignore the undead once you locate him.‚Äù
 The blasphemous blanket of darkness stretched out below them like a great fog, filled with bobbing heads of Velixar‚Äôs army.
 In that chaotic mass, Dieredon knew the man in black would remain well hidden.
 Not until enough of the undead had been massacred.
 He readied his bow, his strong legs the only thing holding him to Sonowin.
 Three arrows pressed against the string of the bow, their tips dipped in holy water.
 His quiver, as was the quiver of every elf flying alongside him, contained water given to them by their clerics of Celestia.
 When their arrows bit into dead flesh, it would be like fire on a dry leaf.
 ‚ÄúLet no life lost this night be in vain!‚Äù Dieredon cried as they descended like a white river, raining arrows into the darkness.
 More than two hundred moving forms halted after that one pass, but a thousand more swayed in their sick, distracting dance.

"Being able to kiss the man I love whenever I want instead of having to wait for him to kiss me."
 "You can kiss me any time, anywhere you want."
 He nibbled on her neck.
 "Day or night."
 He touched the tip of his tongue to the hollow of her throat.
 Marie caught her breath, clutching at Rick's shoulders.
 Her fingers dug into them as his tongue traced a path up her throat to her chin and then to her mouth, teasing her lips until she gripped the back of his head to pull it to hers, needing his mouth hard on hers.
 Rick's kiss was passionate, possessive.
 Alternately he savored the taste and feel of her and then devoured her, feeling her passion and hunger grow.
 Almost without thinking, he slipped his hand inside her blouse just to touch the soft skin of her midriff, but he withdrew it when he heard her gasp.

On the contrary--she wanted more of the kisses and caresses that had set her on fire.
 But when she tried to put her arms around him, he held her away.
 Hurt, she stood up and whirled around to go to her room.
 "Marie, wait.
 Please.
 Sit down and let's talk about this."
 Her body still throbbing with the pulse he'd made race, she perched on the edge of the sofa.
 "I didn't want you to stop."
 "And I didn't want to stop.

"What's up?"
 Whoever was on the other end was talking too quietly for me to make out more than the occasional word.
 "...Jack...now...no time..." I could suddenly feel the energy radiating off of Alec as his beast woke and rose to the surface.
 His limbs hadn't taken on the fine tremble of someone only seconds away from changing shape, but he was obviously unhappy.
 Given the tight leash he kept his beast on, I would have been willing to bet that just about anyone else in the pack would have already shifted shapes and ripped a tree out of the ground or done something equally destructive by now.
 Alec shifted the phone slightly, I couldn't hear whoever was on the other end anymore, but whatever they'd just said hadn't made things any better.
 The invisible ants marching up my arms went to double time and the metaphysical breeze that started on his skin and went outward turned into a full-blown gale.
 "Stall them.
 We'll be down in eight minutes if worse comes to worst you two contain Isaac and tell Dom to sit on Jack.
 Keep Rachel out of the way."

"She won't eat me if I do that?"
 His chuckle pulled my smile wider.
 "No.
 If you're really worried about it just make sure that one of the others are in the room at the same time with you."
 "Now that has some real possibilities."
 I was still rolling the thought around in my mind when the bell rang and Alec pulled me to my feet.
 We swapped out our books and were halfway to Spanish when Vincent and Brandon strode into view.
 Moving so smoothly I was positive that nobody else even realized anything was wrong, Alec swung me around so he was between them and me.
 The tension ratcheted up in step with the rolling waves of energy, as Brandon and Vincent drew nearer.
 They split up when they saw us, casually positioning themselves so Alec couldn't protect me from both of them.

It was amazing that I hadn't made the connection between light, the fact that light acted like a wave, and the rainbows on the parking lot puddles, but it was all making sense now.
 By the time the bell finally rang to release the circus back into the halls, I'd finished up a reasonable outline, and was feeling pretty smart.
 Alec probably expected me to have been totally stumped, but I'd figured out the exact answer to the assignment, and I was so going to show him.
 The glow of satisfaction more than made up for the fact that Britney chattered non-stop on our way to Algebra.
 I felt like I should feel guilty for not liking her, but I was starting to notice how much of her conversation revolved around nasty gossip that made everyone else in the school sound like rejects or sluts.
 When we finally made it to Mrs. Campbell's class, I slid into my seat with a sigh of relief.
 This was the one class all day where I could virtually guarantee I wouldn't be talking to anyone.
 Mrs. Campbell wasn't ever really mean, but she gave off an air that made you absolutely sure she wouldn't put up with any crap.
 We were still working on statistics, which was nice in that I could follow what was being said and wasn't falling any further behind, but kind of a bummer because it meant I couldn't do a bunch of makeup work during class.
 It was a relief when Mrs. Campbell finally capped her marker and turned us loose to work on the homework assignment.

I waited until he turned back around before I whispered, ‚ÄúRuby, did you bring the magic book with you?‚Äù She smiled.
 ‚ÄúCan I read it?‚Äù She winked at me.
 I started to share her grin, but before I could, Chevelle was in front of us, his horse blocking my way.
 I was almost thrown from my saddle when we stopped to avoid running into him.
 He was angry again.
 ‚ÄúFrey.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù ‚ÄúDo you remember the last time you used a spell?‚Äù I recalled the smell of burning flesh as the maps cut into my palms.

 There would be no magic study for me.

The elf had to dodge the kick, and that dodge was all it took.
 The half-orc swung his glowing black blades, cutting his bow, and his body, in twain.
 As the blood poured free, he roared, looked about, and then ran off toward the sound of combat.
 A frail form in rags followed from inside the house, a mirror image in looks but for the paler skin and lack of muscle.
 ‚ÄúYou saw nothing,‚Äù this second half-orc said to him before following the warrior.
 Antonil struggled to his feet, shaking his head all the while.
 ‚ÄúIt keeps getting stranger,‚Äù he muttered.
 He took a step and immediately regretted it.
 As his leg throbbed, he yanked the arrow out.
 His armor had kept it from penetrating too deeply, the barbs unable to latch onto any soft flesh.

It hadn't been real, either because I hadn't examined Simon and Nathanial's lifeless bodies, or maybe because I was repressing the experience like I'd done with so many other parts of my life lately.
 I could feel my mind trying to shut down, hoping to cushion me from the worst implications of what was coming.
 I knew it was going to be bad, could feel it in a sickening, only-seconds-away-from-vomiting kind of way, but couldn't follow the chain of logic through to the very end.
 I let Jasmin help me pull my books together, and then numbly followed her out to the hallway.
 Alec and the rest of the pack were waiting for us at my locker.
 Jasmin calmly opened my locker and put my things away while I was still trying to come to terms with everything.
 Alec took my hand.
 "Are you okay?"
 I shook my head.
 "This is going to be really bad, isn't it?"

Anyway, she takes it out---and this is like the first time either of us has bared anything except our souls and she was just fascinated with it.

 She was jerking on me so expertly‚Äîwell, hell, maybe anything feels right the first time‚Äîand, very quickly‚ÄîI was young---I squirted all over both of us.
 It was a surprise.

 Rage surged through the half-orc‚Äôs veins, his orcish side screaming for blood.
 He fought it down even as a mailed fist smashed against his spine.
 Harruq collapsed to his knees, choking down a furious roar.
 ‚ÄúGoes down easy, I say,‚Äù the guard said to the bowman.
 ‚ÄúHow much you want to bet this guy is the sick bastard killing the kids?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúHow much you wanna bet we can hang him even if he isn‚Äôt?‚Äù the other asked.
 Both guards laughed, and the sickness in Harruq‚Äôs gut grew.

 Rodregas knelt in the grass facing the sun, the sign of the All-Father in the celestial heavens.
 He reached out and wove his fingers together; he pulled his thumbs down and opened his woven hands in the ancient symbol of opening oneself to the gods.
 ‚ÄúDear Celestials in the heavens, we open our hearts to you and we accept our duties as your warriors here in the world.
 Let your courage fill our hearts and your strength fill our arms.
 May we know the guidance of your twin children, Honor and Justice.‚Äù He then knelt down and pulled one of the two short swords from his weapon harness; he crossed his arms and laid the blade across his own upper arms.
 It was possible, only with great concentration to do this without dropping the sword or cutting himself.

The governments of the region have been so preoccupied with ‚Äòre-engineering‚Äô their economic and political systems and with meeting the conditions to attract foreign aid and investment that they have tended to over look the many essential and practical steps needed to implement the reforms on the ground.
 Even if governments had been able to get all the laws and economic policies ‚Äòright‚Äô the first time, there is no assurance that the actual impact on the people would have been less harsh than it has been.
 The so-called ‚Äòshock therapy‚Äô strategy pursued by these countries has been widely criticized for its severity and seeming indifference to social costs.
 But debates regarding the appropriate speed and social cost of reforms divert attention from a more fundamental problem with this approach.
 The essence of shock therapy is a reliance on macro-economic factors to bring about a radical restructuring of the economy and a radical change in the behaviour of individuals and enterprises.
 While monetary policy may prove useful for dealing with short-term adjustment problems within a relatively stable environment, there is no evidence to support its use as the principle instrument for social transition.
 Monetary variables are indicators of the functioning of an economy, but the essential factors which determine the strength and health of an economy are the productivity of its enterprises and its workforce and the material resources of the country.
 Tight monetary policy can generate intense short-term pressure for change in behaviour, but this pressure is applied indiscriminately and often with unexpected and unanticipated results.
 The primary result of premature liberalization of prices was to encourage trade and speculation while discouraging production and investment.
 It distracted attention from fundamental changes in institutions and social attitudes needed for the transition to be successful.

ons and social attitudes have been critical at the start of some of the most92m effective0m liberalization efforts of the continent by some of92m Asia0m's other economies. The first92m China0m summit,92m Asian0m Development Summit and WTO summit at the end of 1996 helped bring about92m a0m constitutional renewal of this liberalization effort, and in nine Pacific states

Still, the thought calmed his own turbulent feelings.
 When her tears were exhausted, Marie rested quietly in Rick's arms.

 She would never have given Davis a second glance if she'd known Rick in 1927.

 Rachel ducked around her brother so she could see the shoes and then smiled before leaning in to whisper.
 "Mom wore those to the Ashure Day Dance, the one where she fell in love with Dad."

The gym was ancient.
 The double entry doors each featured a quartet of small windows.
 When the gatekeeper refused to let us in because the tickets were sold out, Kenny‚Äôs usual good nature expired.
 He raised a fist as though to sock the gatekeeper, a boy in an ROTC costume.
 But instead of punching the kid, he drove his fist through one of the small windowpanes.
 The gatekeeper hollered.
 The next instant, we found ourselves surrounded by teachers, coaches, and a platoon of the ROTC.
 While the chatter of several witnesses turned it all into gibberish, and the gatekeeper shouted, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been drinking,‚Äù Kenny stood still, staring at his bloody fist as though wondering how it happened.

And while self-love always descends into misery, the love of God and others carries us upward, into joy.
 So the happiness we attain is decided simply by how far we travel along the path from self-love to the love of God and of others.
 By the same equation, the more we love ourselves, the more inclined to evil we are, while the more we love God and others, the more we may achieve good.
 As I pull back onto Highway 101, I concluded the greatest evil must be done by those totally in the grip of self-love, and the greatest good by those closest to the annihilation of self.
 I can't find any flaws in that equation, except as regards finding the way along the path away from self-love.
 Dostoyevski maintained our nature compels us to strive toward the love of God and others.
 But preachers often argue that striving does us no good whatever, that in order to grow toward love we need to surrender our selves to God and ask him to lead us.
 Some preachers would contend we can count on God's direct leading, through prayer and messages we will receive if we listen.
 Others would tell us to rely on God indirectly, by reading and following the example of Christ and the principles he gave.
 In the Sermon on the Mount alone, Christ urges us to keep our desires in check, speak the truth, give sacrificially, set aside worries, pray, withhold judgment except about our own thoughts and actions, and ask for good gifts such as wisdom.

from others sound like, "If there's anything fear92m in0m your heaven92m boys0m and your heaven girl, say ye to the judgment-92m-0m as the prophet said,92m 0m... and92m they0m will go fight by fight!" Bad: if there remains, rely on faith.<eop> Perhaps these arguments

 "How?"
 "Kiss me."
 She blushed, but after a moment, she stood on tiptoe and raised her face to press her lips against his.
 She wasn't sure how to begin a kiss, but that obviously wasn't going to be a problem: his lips began moving over hers the moment that they touched.

 Sonowin spun, diving closer to the darkness and underneath the giant hand.
 Cries of pain filled the night as more and more elves fell to the reaching black magic.
 Dieredon held on tight, trusting his life to Sonowin.
 He scanned the battlefield while they whirled up and down, over one hand and then dancing away from another.
 Just as Sonowin pulled higher and higher into the air, outracing more than seven growing hands reaching up for them, the elf spotted two lone figures amid the sea of dead.

There were some seeds and bulbs lying where the ashes fell, and I recognized the scene.
 It was the thistle I had grown.
 The garden.
 I rushed out, leaving the door open as I had found it.
 I hurried from the village, trying to remember where the abandoned garden was located, almost running under the clouding skies.
 It wasn‚Äôt hard to find because of its new size, but if I hadn‚Äôt been half expecting, half fearing the excessive growth, I might not have recognized it.
 Each of the strains I had grown the day Evelyn choked was flourishing.
 Noxious weeds were taking over the meadow.
 As I stood there, frozen before this changed garden, I was overwhelmed by the scene, overtaken by emotion, and had to press my eyes closed.
 Light rain began to fall and I raised my head to the sky, drawing in a deep breath.

 At least that‚Äôs how I think he works.
 Johnny ‚Äì What does that have to do with anything?
 Jim ‚Äì If everyone knew about him it would change how the acted towards him.
 They would treat him like he was special and give him more lee-way.
 Johnny ‚Äì So, where‚Äôs the downside to that?
 Jim ‚Äì It‚Äôs just not Gene‚Äôs way.
 He likes to create a nuisance and a spectacle.
 He‚Äôs better at the former than at the latter, but he does try.

It was completely at odds with the innocent, accepting exterior she usually displayed.
 My surprise must have leaked through.
 Almost as soon the thought crossed my mind Rachel's demeanor crossed back from the older, jaded visage, to one that was more youthful, even embarrassed.
 "Sorry, I know she's your friend.
 I shouldn't say things like that, but that's really what she's doing.
 By the time the actual dance arrives, everyone who is anyone will have a date, most of them picked out by the girl weeks before the boy even started thinking about the dance."
 There wasn't really any bitterness in her voice, but there was something, maybe the same kind of longing I felt when I talked about Prom.

 That would fit with what I know of Britney so far."

And in an instant, how still.
 Steed and Chevelle broke their stare, turning to the noise‚Äîdogs, I thought‚Äîbefore the entire world shifted into action.
 Ruby was gone, vanished from beside me, and I was whisked from my seat, catching only a glimpse of Steed and Chevelle darting past.
 In less than a heartbeat, I was standing over the rocks in the opposite direction, Ruby before me, red curls blocking my view, arms outstretched in readiness.
 Steed and Chevelle were at opposite angles in front of us, both tensed, even more so than they had been in their bout.
 I peered around Ruby‚Äôs mane to see what they were focused on.
 In front of our triangle, directly ahead of Ruby, stood a reedy, blond elf, draped in the long white robe and tassels of council.
 I felt sickened as I absorbed the idea that a council member‚Äîis he a tracker?‚Äîhad been behind me as we were all engrossed in a trivial match.
 He was frozen, unmistakable agony distorting his features.
 I didn‚Äôt know which of the group were restraining him, but Anvil and Grey flanked him, Rhys and Rider a distance behind with their dogs.

Rodregas nodded.
 The pain was easier to manage knowing that at least he was still in the running for the tournament championship.
 Imeralda stepped into his sight shaking her head, ‚ÄúYou men are crazy sometimes; you actually look pleased!
 If your armor had not held you would be dead now.
 And it is not like you are fighting someone who deserves to die.
 Most of these men are honorable warriors.‚Äù Rodregas nodded.
 ‚ÄúTrue, hopefully another day of this though and we will be back to fighting those we should be fighting, and it will be far harder to stop me if I achieve a greater sigil.‚Äù Imeralda crouched down, she had a very serious expression on her face, and Rodregas had a sense that he was not going to like what she said next.
 ‚ÄúRodregas,‚Äù she said slowly, ‚Äúwe are not doing this for vanity right?‚Äù Rodregas nodded, he sensed she knew the answer to the question but was going somewhere with the question.
 She looked around to make sure others in the arena could not overhear.
 ‚ÄúWe attacked a slave caravan simply because there were children and innocents that needed rescuing though the odds were against us.‚Äù Rodregas nodded again.

Not that we talked to anyone, but they were aware of us, apparently.
 And, of course, there were binoculars trained on Lor, as she walked around in the nude.
 (laughs)  But, man, that was my only comfort, my woman, her body, her sweet, enveloping body.
 She suckled me like I was a child‚Äîshe has these breasts, well, sorry‚Äîanyway, we did a lot of fucking, you know, the kind you do until you cry yourself to sleep.
 We fucked in the cold water of the river which ran right below the cabin, standing up, man, cold as hell, I held her up and entered her right there, in front of God and everybody.

Drawing her down with him onto the sofa, he asked, "Is there anything special you want to do tonight?"
 "My last night here."
 Her heart soared and then plummeted, bouncing around erratically just as it had when he'd first told her he could help her get home.
 "I don't know.
 I'll miss TV and the microwave and the blowdryer, but the only thing I'll really have a hard time doing without is you.

I was also told that the dealers would try to move me to another location and I was to stand my ground and never agree to move, even if it was just across the street.
 Steve had a warrant for his arrest in this county so he would attempt to avoid it.
 The officers would be placed all around me and my movement would ruin the bust and endanger me and the officers.
 I guess only time would tell how things would go down and we prepared to head to Wal-Mart parking lot for the big bust.
 I personally would rather be shot at Nordstrom‚Äôs!
 Once in place at the store, I was contacted via my regular cell phone and I was told to make the call to Ashley and tell her where I would meet her in 20 minutes.
 The marked police cars were out of site and honestly I couldn‚Äôt see one officer, undercover or otherwise.
 The unmarked cars were apparently mixed into the parking lot full of cars.

Rodregas‚Äô new body was very gifted, but it was still mortal and some things he would just not be able to do as well as others.
 In some ways this was reassuring, a connection to his past.
 ‚ÄúCan I ask you a question?‚Äù she asked.
 Rodregas smiled and said, ‚Äúof course, what?‚Äù ‚ÄúHave you thought of trying to become a sigil warrior?
 You are a very powerful magician now.
 You could probably take one or even two of the greater sigils and still have more power than you had before, and as a warrior the enhancement from the sigil would make you an even more powerful fighter.‚Äù Rodregas nodded, ‚ÄúI have thought about it.
 In fact, I am sure given the opportunity that I would take on one of the greater or several of the lesser sigils.
 I am a warrior first, not a mage.
 Of course, leaving a little magic left over would be great if I can, but you never really know until after the searing.‚Äù Rodregas paused and then added, ‚ÄúThe problem is that only two groups in the Eastern Realms have the knowledge to do the searing.
 The first, of course, is the Guild of the Celestial Path.

The school was narrower than it was long.
 I could walk around the west end, and use the closest doors on the north side, and still have plenty of time to get to my locker before Biology started.
 I was busy replaying my conversation with Brandon as I walked around the corner of the building.
 The air was already hot enough to suck the moisture out of rocks, but that wasn't the cause of the sudden rush of heat to my face.
 I didn't think I'd ever seen the boy before, but Jasmin was easily recognizable, even half-hidden amid all the intermittently-functioning cooling units that lived on this end of the building.
 I couldn't see much beyond the boy's wild red hair, but even that was enough to tell he wasn't completely comfortable.
 I wanted to turn around and go back the other way, but there was a chance that Jasmin had already seen me, and if so I couldn't afford to look like I was scared of her.
 The fact I actually was terrified she was going to snap and start trying to kill people was irrelevant.
 If I could convince her I wasn't scared, I was less likely to get hurt.
 I kept walking, not necessarily steering closer to the three-quarter wall the boy was leaning against, but also being very careful not to go out of my way to stay further away from them either.

 Ruby didn‚Äôt question why I would be sleeping again so soon.
 She was busy being excited about her upcoming trip.
 I didn‚Äôt share her enthusiasm, so I retired to my room and read more of the journal.
 There were many sad passages after the passing of the writer‚Äôs mother, though their bond didn‚Äôt seem traditional.

Even with Rachel currently an order of magnitude hotter than normal, Jasmin still captured the prize.
 Rachel's work on her behalf had resulted in a makeup job that was so incredibly understated, even us girls had a hard time detecting it.
 Her wavy brunette hair had been straightened and pulled back in what looked like an attempt to let some other girls shine for a change, but it just made her look like a goddess who'd decided to spend the night slumming.
 Given who she'd spent the last hour being surrounded by, it was no wonder Dominic was worried she was the ugly step sister.
 She needn't have worried.
 Her features were even more exotic than Jasmin's, and Rachel had chosen bright colors that made her stand out much more than usual.

Enforcement should be made mandatory and automatic.
 At the same time, it must be recognized that force alone can never eliminate these problems at their roots.
 Aggressive energies must be given constructive channels through which to express themselves positively in economic development.
 Unless and until famine and poverty are eliminated, both in developing countries and in the inner cities of the North, these energies will continue to find negative expression through violence.
 Therefore, a comprehensive approach is called for.
 The measures proposed here must be viewed in conjunction with recommendations made elsewhere in this report to eradicate hunger and unemployment.
 Linkages to commodity trade
 Isolated and independently pursued policies, which appeared highly beneficial at the time enacted, often result in unexpected and unwanted consequences that negate the benefits of the original measures.
 The refusal of high-income nations to meet the demands of developing countries for protection of commodity prices is an example.
 During the 1980s, the debt crisis forced many developing countries to increase exports of basic commodities ‚Äì often at great cost to the environment ‚Äì in an effort to make loan repayments.

She couldn't sleep that night.
 After tossing and turning for hours, she got up and took a long bath.
 By the time she'd dressed, it was dawn.
 She was restless, but she didn't know what she wanted to do.
 Finally she decided to go for a walk in the garden to see if the quiet stroll would help her sort out her thoughts and feelings.
 Davis seemed like a different man since they'd become betrothed.
 He didn't have much time for her, and when they were together, he shouted at her.
 But he always apologized.
 Maybe that was part of being a wife--letting him take out his frustrations on her.

I looked down at my Spanish test and wondered how I'd gotten here.
 There were answers on the page.
 They were unmistakably done in my awkward scrawl, but didn't make sense.
 I flipped the page over and found more of the same.
 My eyes idly traced down the page, finding blanks and almost of its own accord my pencil reached out and filled them in with words that seemed familiar, but whose meaning I couldn't seem to pin down.
 I resurfaced as I walked into the tutor lab, unsure if I'd passed anyone I should have greeted.
 I sat down at my usual spot and pulled out a book at random as Britney stomped into the room and threw her books down.
 She was obviously mad, but once again I couldn't muster enough concern to figure out what'd ticked her off.

We opted to leave Brandon in jail.
 He was released 23 hours later on his own recognizance.
 Brandon spent the days after his release from jail back at our home as we attempted the daunting task of detoxing him.
 Through withdrawals again!
 Brandon became sicker every day that his frail body went without the Oxy it craved to survive.
 Brandon had lived away from our house for over a year and he looked like a ghost of himself.
 His eyes were dark, his enthusiastic personality was gone and his mind seemed permanently altered.
 He was 23 years old, 6‚Äô 2‚Äù and his weight was hovering at a skeletal 130 pounds.
 We had Brandon on complete lockdown at our house with no visitors allowed, searching his room and the entire house daily.
 We ordered professional quality drug tests so we could test him every day.

Rachel took it as the former and sat down next to me, pulling her knees up tight against her chest.
 A few seconds later I heard the howl of an after-market exhaust fed by a turbo-charged engine.
 The green Honda that came screaming through the parking lot was hardly recognizable as an Accord.
 It was approaching too quickly, but I couldn't bring myself to care.
 Besides, Rachel seemed unconcerned.
 Rachel helped me up as the car came to a screeching halt, all four tires locking up to slide it around so that the passenger side was facing us.
 The over-tinted windows smoothly slid down to reveal that James was indeed the driver, and he wasn't any happier than he'd been a few seconds earlier.
 I started towards the back seat, only to feel Rachel's surprisingly-firm grasp guide me towards the front seat.
 She got me settled and then slipped in behind me.
 James pulled out of the parking lot with a rush of acceleration that pinned me to my seat.

‚ÄúThen what am I supposed to do?‚Äù he screamed.
 He whirled around, his helplessness showing on every feature of his face.

 She pulled a strand of hair from her face as the wind blew against her.
 ‚ÄúI have given up everything for you, Harruq.
 Don‚Äôt you see that?
 My friends, my family, my home; they are all gone from me.

Jordaan glanced over to him as if asking for permission and Rodregas nodded his ok. Jordaan reached down and carefully picked up the small frog and cupped it in his hands.
 His eyes were closed in concentration.
 He looked up at Rodregas with a confused expression and asked, ‚ÄúDo you know what this is?‚Äù ‚ÄúNot really, I found it in Raven Keep.
 It felt of magic so I took it.
 I thought it might be worth something.‚Äù Jordaan smiled and laughed as he said, ‚ÄúWorth something indeed.
 This is a minor Sigil of Healing.‚Äù It was Rodregas who gasped this time and said, ‚ÄúInfernals!
 We had a Sigil of Healing all this time?
 If we had inscribed this sigil back at the farm we would never have needed your help.‚Äù Jordaan nodded at the truth of Rodregas‚Äô words and the two of them quickly gathered the others.
 All agreed that no matter what might happen with the greater sigils that all should gain the minor Sigil of Healing.
 Its benefits to warriors and mages alike were well known.

Alec's smile was gentle.
 It reminded me of how Mom looked when I offered to take care of some especially undesirable duty she'd been procrastinating.
 "No, Mother's still the mistress of this house.
 We've waited too long as it is.
 If we don't take care of it now it may be another week or two before we have a chance, and Donovan will be severely disappointed in both of us."
 They were both smiling now, as if at some shared joke, but that didn't help defuse the sudden feeling of nervousness sweeping through me.
 Rachel followed us down a series of corridors, and then waited as Alec knocked on a plain, oak door.
 A half-second passed, and then responding to something too faint for me to hear, Alec gently opened the door.
 A slightly tilted eyebrow seemed to ask Rachel if she wanted to come inside, but she shook her head, now with the slightest of quivers to her chin.
 Whatever I was expecting from Alec and Rachel's reactions, I didn't get it.

Velixar watched the Neldaren army scatter, some chasing elves down streets, others barging into locked homes.
 Screams of pain and dying, although just few and random, filled the air.

 ‚ÄúLet me hear the screams of your victims so that I may find you.‚Äù

All three of them were moving towards us now.
 It was so inhumanly smooth and slow the motion was almost imperceptible, but I was certain they were stalking us.
 Stalking me.
 As soon as they got close enough to cover the remaining distance in a single bound, they'd attack, and if Alec had been sorely pressed fighting two of his kind last night, three were almost certain to kill him.
 Rachel pulled me around behind her and spoke with a calm that seemed too concrete to be real.
 "Jasmin, please don't do this.
 I'm not going to move.
 She doesn't mean anything to you.
 What about me?"
 Jasmin stopped moving.

Luckily, there was no wind down here to toss up the sand and dirt.
 I think I passed the spot where the Kojas had stood in my dream.
 I threw the thoughts out of my head and tried to think of something else.
 Like, where this flat plain of flatness ended.
 ‚ÄúWhere are we going, anyway?‚Äù I asked and stared at the sky.

And it was all true.
 Suddenly, I couldn‚Äôt catch my breath.

 They were circling me, their arms outstretched as if to catch me‚Ä¶ or cage me.
 Black spots floated in my vision.
 My head screamed.
 The sound of metal bands snapping echoed through a scraping, screeching noise inside my head.
 I pressed my palms against my temples.

 I laughed to myself‚Äîno matter how many times I said it, I had no clue what it meant.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a bow hidden in that wagon do you?
 I have no idea how to use one of these pig stickers, but I am very good with a bow,‚Äù said Imeralda.
 She said it clearly expecting him not to have anything.
 Rodregas did, have a bow.
 He had two very nice bows wrapped up in the wagon.
 But, while the short swords he handed them were dangerous, they were common and easy to replace.
 On the other hand, the Black Yew bows were rare and powerful.
 He also thought about the chain mail that he had found in Ravenhurr‚Äôs wardrobe.
 While it was way too small to fit him it would fit Imeralda just fine.

If I ever did manage to kill him, my questionable humanity wouldn't grieve.
 The world would be better for his absence.
 I could hear the other pack now, panting with exertion, our friends hot on their heels.
 Vincent overreached in his effort to claim the kill, and I sunk my teeth into the muscled flesh of his shoulder as I finally made it around behind him.
 My claws sank into his arms and legs as I repositioned to snap his neck, and then a hammer blow of weight struck me across the shoulders.
 Knocked loose from Vincent, I spun around in time to tear Simon from the air as he leaped at me again.
 It was the perfect opportunity to end a life nearly as evil as Vincent's, but one of the recent arrivals had bowled Jasmin over.
 Leveraging a frame that was more than capable of picking up a small car, I threw Simon into the whirling ball of flesh and fangs.
 He didn't hit hard enough to snap his neck, but he knocked the other wolf off of Jasmin, and then Vincent was back on his feet.
 The rest of the rival pack, save for Brandon their leader, came streaming past, but they didn't help their fellows swarm Jasmin and me over.

"I actually prefer they do.
 That way when their parents phone in to complain about how poorly they did on the exam, I can point out that the lab was open for another hour, but they didn't bother to stick around for the extra help."
 It was a speech that made her sound like a grouchy old lady, but I was starting to know her well enough to take it in the proper context.
 She would gladly have done just about anything to help a student who really wanted to learn, but was tired of having students try and use her as an excuse for their own laziness.
 I waved goodbye to everyone as they left, and then made a quick round of the remaining students.
 Rachel and Britney were both in their accustomed places, Rachel studying away as always, and Britney making some weak efforts to do likewise.
 Two of the other three, a boy and a girl I recognized from second hour, but whose names I couldn't even begin to remember, were already packing their books into a pair of book bags, one of which was a fairly utilitarian item, the other of which probably cost as much as my whole wardrobe.
 I couldn't place the last boy for all that he looked really familiar.
 He had incredibly dark skin and features with a slight Middle Eastern cast.

The word confrontation reached out and grabbed me.
 It took a second before I realized it was dragging up memories of the near-fight between Alec and half his pack.
 "What happened last night...it was for real, wasn't it?"
 Rachel didn't ask what I meant; she didn't even bat an eye.
 "I'm afraid so.
 Don't hate the others too much.
 Sometimes when you're that scared it's hard to keep things in perspective.
 Now that they've calmed down a little nobody would really trade you to Brandon on the tiny chance it might smooth things over.
 Not when we'll eventually end up in exactly the same spot."

He'd actually proposed to Kim, but once she had the ring, all she'd wanted to talk about was what pieces she was going to buy to refurnish the house and at which resorts they were going to spend their summers and how much of his money was in the bank and how much in land investments.
 He'd broken up with her six weeks after proposing.
 He'd never gotten the ring back, of course.
 He was lonely.
 Rick sighed, setting down the carton of fried rice and leaning back.
 That was why he‚Äôd been foolish enough to ask Kim to marry him, he now realized.
 He was much more cautious now.
 In fact, Ted said he‚Äôd gone to the opposite extreme.

 Unfortunately the effort meant I was slow responding.
 He moved on before I got anything out.
 "How's your homework coming?"
 Now I did frown at him.
 "I think my mind's going to explode if I look at my Biology book even just one more time this weekend.

 And then she brought them dinner!
 It wasn't very good, but Rick said that they could get some pizza as soon as they got to Hollywood.

In India the textile industry provides employment to 18 per cent of the entire workforce, accounts for 8 per cent of the country's GDP, 17 per cent of its manufacturing capacity, and 27 per cent of its export earnings.
 A recent projection indicates that with the lifting of quotas under the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing in January 2005, India‚Äôs textile exports could rise from the current $16 billion to $40 billion by 2010, creating as many as 12 million new jobs in the process, five million jobs through direct employment in the textile industry and another seven million jobs in allied sectors.
 The global manufacturing strategies of multinational corporations will further spur the exponential growth of contract manufacturing opportunities in developing countries.
 Already China exports $300 billion a year in manufactured products, while Taiwan and Mexico export more than $140 billion each.
 According to a recent study, India has the potential to create 25 to 30 million new jobs in the manufactured exports sector.
 Shift to Services: One would hardly expect to find the decline of manufacturing jobs as a source of employment opportunities, but historical data supports this conclusion.
 Fear over the destruction of manufacturing jobs due to adoption of capital intensive technology has been prevalent for the past 100 years.
 Every new technology that automates a process or increases worker productivity has been perceived as a threat to the future of work.
 The reality has proved to be quite different.

 "Believe what you will.
 There's no reason to worry about a concussion."
 "Then why did you tell the sub I'd hit my head?"
 He looked away for a moment, almost as though deciding whether or not to tell the truth.
 "I presumed you wouldn't want to stay and be subject to everyone's questions.

 Apparently he'd decided against the truth option.

Nearly all of his belongings that were worth anything were stolen by the scumbags who had been his peers.
 We heard Brandon‚Äôs girlfriend, Tiffanie, was afraid to return to the house while our son was in jail and it was probably the smartest thing she had done in years.
 Brandon had accumulated flat screen TV‚Äôs, computers, stereo equipment, guns, you name it and it was all gone.
 Most of it, if not all of it was drug trade merchandise or purchased with drug sale money before his drug habit escalated to the point that his addiction was larger than he could support with his sales.
 The area under the rental house had been dug out and reinforced to grow indoor marijuana.
 It resembled an escape tunnel from a prison movie.
 None of this was intended for the eyes of a parent.
 I don‚Äôt believe mine or Thomas‚Äôs place ever looked half as bad, but if I could see the boxing ring, mismatched couches and the hanging roach clip from where I stand now, who knows what it would look like to me.

Told to follow two undercover cars to the back of a nearby hotel, we were met by about a dozen different police officers in varying attire.
 Some were in marked squad cars but most looked like everything from an ordinary guy to a punk with a beanie on his head.
 Scruffy beards to cleanly shaven, they were an unlikely melting pot of law enforcement.
 They were driving a variety of cars and trucks, old and new.
 It was beginning to get dark and that is what the officers wanted.
 I was instructed by Officer White to stand beside my truck while two officers searched the vehicle and verified that I had no weapon, cash or drugs inside.
 Then I was searched and the officers asked me to remove my shirt so they could wire me up.
 I stood there arms out in this parking lot surrounded by police, as they taped this wire to my body.
 Several cars drove slowly through the hotel parking lot, gawking.

I shrank back away from him, and saw his face go from calm to expressionless in a barely detectable flicker.
 I'd opened my mouth, maybe to apologize, or possibly to scream for help, but it snapped shut at Alec's response.
 Moving faster than I would have believed possible, he spun around and fled through the door.
 Between one heartbeat and the next he disappeared into the darkness, letting the door slam shut with enough force that the glass in the ceiling should have come down in a rain of razor-edged shards.
 The flowers closest to me swayed slightly from the force of the vibrations, pulling my gaze towards them.
 I felt my heart skip a couple of times and tears start to flood my eyes as I took in beautiful white petals edged in an amazing shade of purple.
 Lagrimas del Angel.
 The whole greenhouse was filled with them, and suddenly I couldn't ignore the significance of the circular signature on the paintings anymore.
 I hurried outside, looked desperately from side to side for some hint of which way he'd gone, and then headed off to the right towards the sound of shattering pottery.
 Just before I was about to give up hope of finding him, I heard another crash and turned into a small grotto.

In the parking lot, vendors sold oranges, onions, tapes and CDs in Spanish.
 I didn't see any Mother Teresa dolls, but I was half asleep.
 At 6:30 the church was crowded, standing room only.
 I found a place against the west wall near the front section, where the seats were reserved for MC sisters in their white saris.
 They are mostly small brown women with eyes so bright, at first glance they could pass for children.
 Up front, across from me was a small choir accompanied by a guitar and electric keyboard.
 They sang folk style hymns like ‚ÄúChange my heart oh God, make it ever new, change my heart oh God, make me be like you.‚Äù I leaned against the wall observing the congregation, vaguely aware that my heart sorely needed to change, since that morning my pastime was criticism.
 I grumbled inaudibly at the people who crowded, trying to position themselves for a clear view of Mother Teresa's approach.
 I disdained the TV camera bearers who nudged the rest of us aside as if the front row was their birthright.
 Watching the choir, I wondered if the women wearing doilies on their heads believed the accessory would meet the spirit of Saint Paul's admonition that women should keep their heads covered in church.

In formulating strategies, it is essential to take fully into account both the stages and steps of the development process.
 At this stage in their development, it is highly unlikely that food-deficit African nations can make rapid progress toward food self-sufficiency without strong government support and investment to improve technology, training, techno-infrastructure and trade.
 Once the rural sector begins to exhibit its own dynamism, as in the majority of developing countries, there is strong justification for a shift in the role of government from that of prime mover, planner and controller of development to that of catalyst and pioneer.
 Government agencies can tap the potentials of agriculture, identifying new commercial opportunities, educating farmers, demonstrating new potentials, assisting in the transfer and dissemination of new technology, and promoting the establishment of effective organizations ‚Äì preferably privately or co-operatively owned by farmers or at least with their participation ‚Äì to process, distribute and market what is produced.
 Coping with the environmental problems to preserve the ecological foundations essential for sustainable agriculture is an area in which government has special responsibilities and must play a leading role on an ongoing basis.
 Regulating the diversion of prime farm land for non-farm uses, expansion of irrigation capacity, control of groundwater exploitation, major programmes for reforestation and to prevent or reverse desertification, and regulation of pesticide use can only be effectively planned, monitored and regulated by governments.
 Comprehensive Strategies
 In this and previous chapters, we have tried to present an integrated perspective of the political, economic and technological factors that need to be taken into account in formulating a comprehensive approach to the issues of peace, food and employment.
 In an effort to illustrate the potential efficacy of this approach in a country representing nearly 25 per cent of the world‚Äôs poor, ICPF conducted an in-depth country level study in India to evolve a strategy for stimulating massive increases in job growth and food production (see box pp.

She‚Äôd worn only her 1927 clothes, and her mind hadn‚Äôt wandered to 2011 at all.
 What more could she do?
 Well, one thing she wasn‚Äôt going to do was give up, she determined as she played with the hem of her dress.
 She‚Äôd strolled through her garden countless times without walking into 2011, so who knew how many times she‚Äôd have to walk in the garden to get back to 1927?
 She wasn‚Äôt going to give up.
 Rick, still concerned about Marie, left work at 4:30, making a quick stop to pick up a surprise for her.
 To his dismay, he found her huddled in a corner of the sofa, still wearing her 1927 clothes.
 ‚ÄúHi, sweetheart,‚Äù he greeted her, going to sit beside her.

 These dreams took me farther.
 My sight was off, not as clear, distorted.
 But as I lingered there, I knew the cause.
 I was seeing from a horse.
 We were outside the stone walls of the fortress finding sparse greens to eat, which bored me even in a dream.
 I encouraged the horse to run and he responded immediately, taking flight down the mountainside.
 The rocks streaked past us as we ran faster and faster, the wind whipping his mane.

They all turned back to the door and started filing out again, but by tomorrow half the school would know exactly how badly I'd just been humiliated.
 I found myself just outside the tutor lab with no recollection of having stumbled to my locker, or going by Physics to grab the stuff I'd left there.
 Still, somehow my Spanish book had disappeared, replaced by my math book.
 My knees started shaking as I entered the room, but I made it safely to my normal table before they gave out.
 "Adri, Adriana?
 Excuse me."
 I didn't recognize the girl standing across from me, but based on her uncomfortable expression and the fact that more than one person had turned for the sole purpose of watching us out of the corner of their eyes, she'd been standing there longer than I'd realized.
 Apparently my looking up was enough of a response for her to proceed.

The end of the Cold War was expected to usher in an age of peace, but actually violence is on the rise in both developing and developed countries because of the widening gap between human expectations and achievements.
 This growing gap between expectations and achievements is at the root of contemporary turbulence worldwide.
 The popular and some times violent demand for freedom and participatory democracy, the return of religion in politics, surging ethno-nationalism and intolerance, and rising urban crime are disparate expressions of this phenomenon.
 In Eastern Europe, where a peaceful revolution from within has broken the shackles of statism that long confined the energies of people, these energies now surge forward in high and eager expectations of a better life.
 Already there are growing signs of impatience, disappointment and frustration arising from the greater hardships that have come in place of the greater benefits that all expected.
 It is essential that these energies be channelled into constructive pursuits that generate tangible improvements.
 Otherwise they may recoil from the effort and look backwards to a failed system or be guided by false prophets on a path that once again poses a threat to other nations.
 The phenomenon of growing violence in an age of increasing affluence seems to contradict the thesis that poverty is one of the major causes of violence, until we realize that the increasingly visible signs of prosperity the world over raise the expectations and aggravate the sense of deprivation and revolt among those that have been by-passed by the general progress.
 Greater political and social freedom can only further magnify this tendency.
 This suggests that violence at the international, national and community levels cannot and will not be eradicated before poverty itself has been abolished, and that, if poverty is left unaddressed at its source, further economic progress is likely further to aggravate conflict in society, unless we are able to extend the benefits of progress to everyone.

Prom night, for reasons more complicated than I can remember so long, Cliff was driving a '49 Ford convertible that belonged to Bob Williams, whom I will visit in Portland a few days from now.
 Cliff's date was Chris Latin.
 Karen and I rode in the back seat.
 Karen had a cold.
 Maybe her reason for keeping her distance, physical and otherwise, was hygienic concern for my health.
 Or maybe she didn't approve of my dating Liz.
 Whatever the truth, she wounded my already tenderized feelings.
 For a while during the after-prom at a bowling alley, I left her and found Margaret.
 We hid under a pool table and talked about Eric and our dubious futures.

Mrs. Campbell needed a little bit of reassuring when she stopped by my desk, which I did happily now that my personal universe was looking up once again, and then I dug into my homework with near-normal gusto.
 Time flew by all too quickly.
 Soon it was just me holding down the fort and trying to take care of a trio of freshmen girls who seemed to be at least slightly ahead of the normal cramming curve.
 I was glad they weren't waiting until the day before the test to come in for help, but it was looking like tomorrow wasn't going to be any fun.
 Maybe I'd get lucky again, and most of the lazy ones would give up before my shift started.
 I turned around from explaining for the fourth time to the third person why you couldn't prove congruence of two triangles with the nonexistent angle-angle-angle postulate, only to find that Britney had slipped out of the room.

Before he got help now, he would need to hit rock bottom.
 Hopefully he‚Äôd survive it.
 Then, one day Thomas called.
 Brandon just contacted him from some street corner in a bad part of town outside of San Diego.
 Brandon said he was broke, addicted, alone and ready to commit himself to rehab.
 Thomas said he had dropped what he was doing and was driving directly to find him, as he knew Brandon might change his mind.
 Thomas said that most drug addicts would take every drug they could get their hands on if they knew they were going to rehab, and this was dangerous.
 He was off to the rescue!
 Thomas called again when he had Brandon in his car, saying while Brandon looked horrible, he was alive and on his way to a detox center, which would be followed by rehab‚Äîhopefully.

If I hadn't been so stubborn, if I had trusted God from the time I first believed, I might've spent all these years in a richer world, maybe not living every moment in the kingdom of heaven, but residing close enough so I could visit more regularly.
 And I might've done a lot of good for other people.
 In this sorry condition, I decide that my darkest sin, the one so loathsome I should never stop grieving over it, isn't any of the wicked stuff I have thought or done.
 My darkest sin is failing to do all the thousands of good works I could have done for people.
 All because I was willful and didn't allow myself to truly love them.

I thought about hiding in the bathroom for a while, but that was exactly the kind of place a girl like Cassie would want to catch me.
 Instead I took a deep breath and walked outside.
 Britney was waiting for me.
 By her expression she'd decided on being mad.
 "Do you realize what you just did?"
 I was still fresh out of witty comments.
 I just shrugged instead.
 Britney had been mad before, now she looked furious.
 "You just picked sides, and you picked the wrong one."
 Maybe I still wasn't recovered from my ordeal on Friday; I felt like I was missing something obvious.

True or not, that rumor is the most romantic thing anyone here has ever heard.
 It will transform you into a mini-celebrity overnight."
 The haze was starting to evaporate from my thoughts, the story still didn't make sense, but Rachel's explanation did.
 "The story's vague enough that nobody can really prove or disprove it.
 Don't get specific on any details, and you can ride this all the way until you graduate."
 The mask was gone, she wasn't lying anymore.
 She really believed this rumor would change everything for the better.
 It all made sense, but didn't explain who'd started it, or why they'd done it.
 Rachel's face told me she wouldn't answer either of those questions.
 I finally settled on one I thought she might answer.

‚ÄúSo how did Geriodon and Nordien finish?‚Äù asked Rodregas.
 Doi‚Äôvan spoke, ‚ÄúGeriodon finished first place which puts him in the total lead with a perfect fifteen points.
 Nordien only got a third place red ribbon so he has only eleven, Karun is now second with thirteen points.‚Äù Rodregas nodded.
 With only nine points he was unlikely to be able to compete in the final championship melee.
 ‚ÄúImeralda, can you do me a favor?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 ‚ÄúOf course, but I am not sure how I can help,‚Äù she said.
 Rodregas nodded, but said, ‚ÄúCan you go around to the other top finishers and talk to them, and also go around tonight to the other squires and try to get a feel for them.
 See if  you can find out who people want to win and why?‚Äù Imeralda was clearly confused by the odd request, but nodded, and after a little talk she slipped away to the food line and within moments was in an animated discussion with a few squires at another table.
 Rodregas thought Doi‚Äôvan might ask, but he showed no interest and instead said, ‚ÄúWhile most of the knights are too high and mighty to talk to a Hellborn, the staff is not so closed mouthed.
 The greater sigils are said to be guarded twenty four hours a day in a great chamber in the very heart of the Cathedral.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd did you ask if sworn men were allowed in with a new knight?‚Äù asked Rodregas with a smile.

I started to push away from Brandon.
 My efforts seemed futile for several seconds, and then his right arm released me.
 He wasn't letting me go though, his right hand had just repositioned to my stomach while his left arm kept me pinned against him almost as tightly as both hands had just a second before.
 It should have been obvious what he had in mind, but it wasn't until his hand was under my shirt and moving upwards that my overloaded mind caught up with events.
 I tried to protest, tried harder to push myself away from him, but he just held onto me tighter than even before.
 His hand was just millimeters away from its target, and I was starting to see stars from lack of air, before I finally remembered some of the tricks my dad had shown me.
 I slammed my heel down on his left foot, and then brought my knee upwards towards his crotch, only to hit nothing but air as he spun me around.
 "What the crap are you doing?"
 He wasn't even limping.
 He seemed more surprised than angry.

The hardest part was not being able to tell you anything."
 Alec started to open the door, but Rachel put a hand on his arm.
 "The rest of the pack is back.
 Jasmin already told them what happened.
 It doesn't look good."
 I had my mouth open and was halfway to asking what was going on when I saw Alec's expression, and swallowed my words.
 He didn't look any different than normal, in fact if I'd been standing forty or fifty feet away from him I'd probably have still thought he was just as calm and in control as always.
 This close, I could feel the anger radiating off of him.
 I almost took a step back when he turned towards me.

He stepped up close looking up at the beast; he was massive!
 The beast‚Äôs mouth was open, not as if he was going to roar, but simply in relaxed pose.
 He looked like he had been caught stalking forward on the hunt.
 Rodregas stepped up and just stared at him.
 He was beautiful.
 ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch,‚Äù barked Doi‚Äôvan.
 Rodregas nodded, he knew not to touch, but then realized that his hand was raised and had been reaching out to stroke the lion‚Äôs mane.
 He knew that this was the greater sigil that he wanted to gain.
 It was in a perfect circle.

A cursory nod at one another signaled the onset of the bout and both tensed and crouched slightly into a ready stance.
 I found myself leaning forward as we waited.
 Chevelle moved to stand beside me, he too intent.
 Grey wagged his eyebrows at Steed, taunting him to make the first move.
 ‚ÄúCome on, blossom,‚Äù Steed teased back, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs see what you‚Äôve got.‚Äù At that, Grey disappeared and then, in a flash, was behind Steed, reaching up to smack him in the back of the head.
 The instant before he struck, Steed ducked into a squat and spun, taking Grey‚Äôs legs out from under him.
 I flinched.

He laughed.
 "I'm going to go make dinner while you amuse yourself."
 "Don't use the microwave without me!"
 After dinner they spent the evening watching TV.
 For Rick, it was almost like watching TV with a child: Marie had questions about everything.
 It was fun to watch the wonder on her face and the avid attention she gave the programs.
 "I'm afraid I'm going to have to go to bed, Marie.

 Today it didn't seem quite as bad, as long as I didn't think of her actual name.

 Now it was her turn to look guilty and fidget just a little bit.

Then Doi‚Äôvan and Rodregas had found some cover that still gave a good view of the road.
 They sat on the ground and waited until Imeralda signaled that something was coming.
 Rodregas neither heard nor saw any activity and his physical senses were far more accurate than when he had been a young man.
 His guess was that her connection with the forest had somehow warned her that something was coming.
 Doi‚Äôvan and Rodregas looked at each other as they squatted down in the shrubs.
 Doi‚Äôvan had one of the Black Yew bows out, with arrows at hand, if needed.
 It would not be surprising if a patrol of the Immortal Guard would be on the road.
 The road was the main route from the port city of Chrisana Stone to the Menagerie of Sky, Earth and Water; the slave city run by the Immortalist Taiga.
 Most likely what Imeralda sensed was simply a trade caravan running a regular route from Chrisana Stone to any of several of the Eastern Realms cities.
 If it was a light scouting patrol of just two or three guards that was coming; it would be the best case scenario for them to take on some Immortalist Guards and gain better weapons, armor and horses.

The real constraint on job creation in the industrial nations is not the price of labour, but the need for increased capital investment, partly to counter the effects of reduced military spending and the drastic fall in output and demand in Eastern Europe.
 Increasing public investment to stimulate employment is constrained by widespread concern about rising levels of public debt.
 Recent reports state that the gross debt of OECD countries has risen from 35 per cent of GDP in 1970 to 70 per cent in 1993.
 But this figure is of questionable significance.
 The gross debt includes the debt held by government departments and public agencies as well as by private institutions and individuals.
 When the government-held portion is deducted, the actual net debt of these countries is approximately half the gross debt, which means the net interest burden for servicing the debt is also only half.
 Furthermore, it is not clear that a comparison of debt to GDP is a very meaningful index.
 Debt is a cumulative measure of stock, while GDP is an annual measure of flow.
 When the total debt of OECD countries is compared to the total capital stock of these countries, the debt is equal to a relatively modest 15 per cent of the current capital stock of these nations.
 In contrast to the recommendations made by the OECD, the Delors Plan for stimulating employment in Western Europe, which was recently rejected by member countries of the European Community, called for a large increase in public investment in expensive communication and transportation infra structure projects as a means of creating more jobs in the near term and increasing the competitive ness of European economies by improving their infra structure.

Yet what magic could capture such powerful beasts for the use of creating sigils?
 Had the greater sigils been gifts to mortals from the Gods themselves?
 Rodregas yearned to reach out and touch to see if they felt like flesh or stone.
 But, to do so would set his path for the rest of his life.
 If he was truly strong enough for two as Imeralda thought, then he could be a lion and what else?
 ‚ÄúWell, Doi‚Äôvan, what do you think?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 ‚ÄúI am going to choose lion, but it would be great to have a pride, or maybe the Moon Wolf or the Mountain Bear.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan nodded and walked over to the bear.
 It was a kind of bear that Rodregas had not heard of in the mortal world, even larger than ‚Äòhis‚Äô lion.
 The bear actually had a thick tail and its teeth seemed far larger than any bear he had heard of.

Now that I am officially a knight, I want to bring my sworn men into the chamber and figure out what sigils I will choose.‚Äù At his words the men‚Äôs faces tightened and they looked at his supposed servants.
 Rodregas nodded his understanding.
 He also knew from his own ‚Äòillustrious‚Äô career as a guard that the others would follow the rules.
 They were not officers to be making judgments.
 ‚ÄúI know you don‚Äôt like my servants being a Hellborn and a Nymph,‚Äù he said keeping his voice light.
 ‚ÄúBut they are my sworn men and I trust them; and it is my call.

Hopefully they'd quiet down once the actual show started up.
 Judging by the orchestra, it was almost time.
 I looked back, intending to shoot the obnoxious pair a nasty glare in the hopes it would shut them up, and instead caught Alec's eye.
 The house lights were still bright enough for me to make out every detail of his perfect face, and yet I was still baffled by his expression.
 He'd obviously been staring at me, was still staring at me actually, but it wasn't a leer.
 It was something else, it made me want to blush, or maybe smile and toss my hair.
 Whatever it was, it left my skin feeling warmer than usual, and more than a little tight.
 Even after I looked away with a flush of embarrassment, I still felt like I could feel his eyes watching me.
 I could feel his presence behind and to the left of me, like a gentle tingle of electricity I could've pointed to even with my eyes closed.
 I resisted the urge to look back again as the lights dimmed and the orchestra began the opening strains of the first number.

He shook his head and nodded over to the dragon.
 I looked and to my surprise it was bending down to let Emily stroke its head.
 She patted its head and it curled up outside the cave.
 She bent down to whisper something in its ear and then stood up again.
 ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she said looking at us, ‚Äúwhat are you waiting for?‚Äù She disappeared in the cave.
 Then she poked her head out.
 ‚ÄúCome on!‚Äù We walked slowly into the cave.
 I glanced over at the dragon, which was now asleep and making small puffs of smoke in the rain.

 "They're definitely being careful not to kill each other.
 Isaac could've connected with his claws instead of his fist."
 Jasmin and Jessica were circling each other now.
 It reminded me of a fight I'd seen between two feral dogs while I was still in grade school.
 The dogs had circled for five or ten seconds, and then one had thrown himself at the other.
 A neighbor had broken the fight up with a few thrown stones before it'd come to a grisly end, but it'd been obvious once the first dog had latched onto his opponent's throat that it was only a matter of time before the smaller dog would've died.
 This was exactly the same, only it happened faster as Jasmin blurred into motion.
 One moment she was growling at Jess from a distance of more than five feet, the next instant she was on top of Jess, and her teeth were latched around the smaller wolf's throat.
 Dominic's hand tightened on mine as Jess began to whine, but Alec took a menacing step forward and Jasmin released Jessica with another growl.

Rodregas said, ‚ÄúYes, we do.
 You seem like an honorable squire, would you also like a minor Sigil of Healing?‚Äù He thought she was going to laugh at his question at first, but then she simply whispered, ‚ÄúThat simple?‚Äù ‚ÄúAlmost.‚Äù Rodregas said.
 ‚ÄúPromise to say nothing about this, and also promise that you will use your sigil wisely and that if you have a chance to help us you will do so.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou are creating your own little Shadow Order?‚Äù she asked.
 She was referring to stories of secrete orders of knighthood that lived in the ‚Äòshadows.‚Äô Rodregas started to say no but then thought the idea actually had some advantages, ‚ÄúWelcome to the Order of‚Ä¶,‚Äù he paused.
 He almost said ‚ÄúThe Celestial Lions.‚Äù But while he might be filled with the essence of a Celestial animal, he stood with a being of elemental power and one of infernal power.
 ‚ÄúThe Lion,‚Äù he simply finished.
 It was the only real symbol that he could think of.
 ‚ÄúWhat of the others?‚Äù she asked.
 Rodregas was confused by her question and asked, ‚ÄúWhat others?‚Äù Karun answered, ‚ÄúThere are a lot of very good squires here, honorable men and women who could benefit from the sigil.‚Äù Rodregas‚Äô head was spinning at the idea.

I kept seeing Jason's knives fly off into the woods, or sink into the ground, instead of hitting their mark.
 ‚ÄúAnd now half-ling,‚Äù it whispered with joy, ‚Äúyou die.‚Äù It lunged up at me.
 I had a sudden feeling inside and I stabbed at the creature.
 It tried to change forms to avoid the knife's path but somehow my knife stabbed it anyway.
 It withered and then went still.
 I gasped as the body fell to the ground and even some of the creatures, around stopped.
 They murmured among each other, ‚ÄúShe killed a syphon!
 She killed one of us.‚Äù So the awful creatures were called syphons?
 What did they want?
 I made a mental note to tell Emily about this.

‚ÄúIgnore them,‚Äù Harruq said.
 ‚ÄúI know what I‚Äôm doing.‚Äù
 He led them into an alley in between several worn buildings made of stone.
 He stopped just before the next set of homes, for he heard talking.
 Holding Qurrah back, he peered around the corner to find a soldier dressed in finely polished armor raising his sword in salute.
 At first Harruq did not see who he saluted, but an elf fell from the roof and landed before the soldier.
 ‚ÄúAn elf,‚Äù Harruq whispered, managing to grab Qurrah‚Äôs attention.
 Now both peered around the corner, curious why such an exotic creature had arrived mere seconds before war.
 ‚ÄúGreetings, Dieredon,‚Äù the soldier hailed, pulling off his helmet.
 He was a middle-aged, blond-haired man who had numerous scars on his face.

Skimming above the darkness, Dieredon fired volley after volley behind him.
 When they were past the undead, he pulled Sonowin high into the air to observe the battlefield.
 The ranks of the undead were half of what they had been, yet still he could not see the lowered black hood he so badly needed to see.
 ‚ÄúCome, Sonowin, we will find him, even if it means killing every last one of his puppets.‚Äù
 The horse neighed and dove, spurred on by the sight of its own kind falling in death.

Something had to change.
 My kids didn‚Äôt deserve a catatonic dad.
 One late afternoon as I sat on the grass at the University of San Diego, overlooking the harbor and wondering how I could fix my emotions, I mumbled, ‚ÄúOkay, where should I start?‚Äù Then I remembered advice Master Jeong, our Tae Kwon Do instructor, often gave.
 He told us, "Everything begins with the spirit.
 From the spirit come the thoughts.
 From the thoughts come the actions.
 From the actions come the habits.
 From the habits comes the character.
 And from the character comes the destiny.‚Äù Stupefied by stress as I was, I sat a while wondering where on that continuum I should start trouble-shooting, until the obvious made itself clear.

 ‚ÄúA sign,‚Äù Jason muttered and snapped his fingers.
 ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it!
 Jazell likes to leave clues, check the arrow.‚Äù Emily turned the arrow and saw a sloppy line drawn through two squiggly circles.
 She squinted closer and saw that Jazell had tried to make the line some sort of sword but epically failed.
 Emily showed Jason and he nodded.

It is one of the reasons I am prized for my potential with more than one power.
 My AElven ancestry is strong with mortal magic, but my Nymph side is strong in elemental magic.
 If an Immortalist takes my power, he or she could become stronger in both.‚Äù ‚ÄúMostly correct,‚Äù Jordaan said.
 ‚ÄúIt is actually a topic of much debate among magicians.
 I go along with the belief that there is no such thing as ‚Äòmortal‚Äô magic.
 While we don‚Äôt have time now to go over all the proof, the general thought is that mortals are truly just animals and don‚Äôt produce magic.
 It is only our connection to other realms that provides us power.
 Mana is the raw energy of magic no matter what its source.
 You can use mana from any source to cast spells.‚Äù He looked around at the three of them to make sure they understood.

 He sighed and turned to Sergan, his trusted advisor in war.
 The man was old, scarred, and had dirty hair falling down to his shoulders.

Mom has always been paranoid about open flames.
 She'd nearly burned down the house as a kid.
 I was halfway to the front door before Mom grabbed my arm and turned me back towards the kitchen.
 "I can't believe you.
 You really would have left without realizing it was your birthday?"
 Ugh.
 No wonder I had a headache.
 My brain must have been working overtime in an effort to block out the fact I was now another year older.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù I asked.
 Seth crawled back to the edge and I joined him.

 ‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù Seth hissed under his breath.
 ‚ÄúCompany for us.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhoo‚Ä¶‚Äù I mumbled.
 He rolled his eyes and shifted his gaze back to the monsters.
 ‚ÄúWhere are they going?‚Äù ‚ÄúUh, we follow them,‚Äù I said.
 ‚ÄúI think.‚Äù ‚ÄúYup, we just follow a bunch of monsters that would like to smash us to pulp and serve us for dinner,‚Äù Seth said and started to slide down the side of the hill.

 A blue portal ripped through the air before Qurrah, beckoning him.
 He looked through but saw only mists and distorted landscape.
 Seeing nothing to lose, he got to his feet and stepped inside.
 He felt the sensation of traveling a great distance yet his mind insisted he had taken only a single step.
 He could see the orange glow of the great pyre several miles away.

 Alec's mom was tiny.
 It was easy to see where Rachel got her slight frame from, but there was more than just genetics at work.
 I'd never seen someone with so little extra flesh on their bones, at least not outside a hospital.
 It seemed she should be wearing a hospital gown instead of the white, flower-print summer dress I was almost sure cost more than my whole wardrobe.

 I hesitated but told him what Kojas said about him too, and I saw him stiffen.
 ‚ÄúI'm sorry,‚Äù I found myself saying.
 Seth shook his head.
 ‚ÄúIt's not your fault that he said those things about me.
 I'm happy you didn't try to keep it from me.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat should we do?‚Äù I asked desperately.

His eyes passed over Rodregas to glance at the prisoners.
 He nodded without a word and went back to peering through the tube.
 Rodregas had never understood how the stars in the night sky could make the world closer or farther away from the Celestial Realm, where the Gods lived, or how that could affect magic, but he knew the placement of the stars was critical to the success of the ceremony tonight.
 Ravenhurr was an attractive man, like most of the Immortalist Sorcerers.
 After all, if you can pick your body, why would you ever choose an ugly one?
 Rodregas looked over again at the man that he had brought up the stairs.
 With the ability to select your body you would choose someone like that: attractive, talented and a natural athlete.
 Rodregas stood to the side waiting for Ravenhurr‚Äôs signal.
 Ravenhurr raised his head up from the tube again and scanned the rooftop making sure all the parts of the ceremony were in place.
 Rodregas had always thought that it was only Ravenhurr‚Äôs eyes that gave away the fact that what was inside him was not as attractive as his exterior.

 ‚ÄúI'm defiantly not coming over anytime soon.‚Äù Emily laughed and the boys stopped walking.
 The trees parted to reveal a rock ledge.
 I spotted a small cave, the entrance covered in thick, twisted bramble.
 The sky was getting even darker and more ominous when Seth turned around to face us.
 ‚ÄúWe'll head for the cave and stay there for the night,‚Äù Seth said.
 ‚ÄúThen we'll set off.‚Äù Emily crossed her arms.

The bedroom was possibly the nicest room I'd ever been in.
 A movie star or millionaire would have had a hard time topping this place for sheer decadence.
 The walls were paneled in some kind of rare, doubtless expensive imported hardwood.
 The bookcases that covered the majority of the wall space seemed to be made out of the same kind of wood, and were filled with more books than I'd seen in the local bookstore the one time I'd convinced Britney to stop by on our way home after school.
 They were all hardbound, with leather bindings and engraved covers.
 There was a stereo system off in one corner, hooked up to a laptop and some kind of portable music player.
 I had to look around the room twice before I finally spotted the speakers to the system.
 They were built into the walls and ceiling, and based on their number and varying sizes I had a sneaking suspicion they'd produce nearly as much volume as the monsters professional DJs brought to dances.
 Based on the amount of money involved in setting up such a system in the first place, they probably cranked all that out without even the slightest hint of distortion.
 As impressive as the stereo no doubt was, it was all of those shelves filled with books that finally pulled me off of the bed and onto the incredibly lush, maroon carpet.

I0m had mentioned92m the0m92m carpet0m. I couldn't contain92m all0m of the books and the desire to flip through the pages again.92m I0m had to flip from page to page twice, remembering how to read them again; and while there were slightly different covers for every turn there were they all the exact same type

Oh, no.
 No, no, no.
 My head cleared, but Chevelle still held me around the arms.
 My neck flushed, my eyes shooting to my lap.
 I couldn‚Äôt look at him.
 What am I doing?
 The door opened and Chevelle‚Äôs hands dropped as he stood to face the newcomer.
 ‚ÄúThey are here.‚Äù It was Steed‚Äôs voice, but I didn‚Äôt raise my head, the blood still hot in my cheeks.

 Plus, they're like the two hottest people in the entire school.

 It was hard to argue with that.
 Jasmin was the kind of brunette who disproved the old saying that gentlemen prefer blondes.
 Any guy with a pulse would want her.
 And Alec was like a composite of every gorgeous model ever born.

As Britney pulled us even closer, almost into the dead zone between the two factions, I finally realized the smaller girl was Rachel.
 "You're going to get what's coming to you, you little slut."
 The blonde's voice sounded exactly like I'd imagined, arrogant, vindictive and only barely controlled.
 Rachel on the other hand sounded calm, speaking in tones I shouldn't have been able to hear, except the spectators were unnaturally quiet.
 "I haven't done anything to you, Cassie, and you know it.
 This is all just an excuse."
 I looked around for teachers, but they were still conspicuously absent.
 There wasn't time.
 Even if they arrived right now, someone was probably going to get hurt.
 Cassie tossed her hair and smiled, a plastic expression that bordered on a smirk.

If I really did have a ride, she could leave without ruining things with Brandon; but if I wasn't going to lie, then there was a good chance that Mrs. Campbell would find out she'd left early.
 Parents were relatively easy to fool.
 Leave the tutor lab early, go somewhere else and kill some time until you were supposed to come home, and they'd never know the difference.
 Teachers were a little harder, but if you didn't have the help of your 'friends', then they became an insurmountable obstacle.
 The gears finally ground to a stop and Britney sighed as she put her head down on the table.
 I tried to stop from smiling at her theatrics, but happened to look over at Rachel just in time to see a matching smile on the younger girl's face.
 Before I could look away, Rachel held up the red side of her card.

 Rodregas had known that fact, but had not really thought about it.
 ‚ÄúSo what you are saying is that Imeralda forms a life bond like a AElf.
 But while a normal AElf has only one she can form multiple bonds, and she has a bond with you and a bond with me?‚Äù he asked.
 ‚ÄúYes, I know of few other cases like this.
 She will always know where you are.
 And my guess is if you are open to the bond, you will be able to know where she is.
 But, there are also deeper implications.

When I finally caught up with her she'd recovered enough to complain, but there was a breathless nature to her voice that told me she wouldn't be skipping the math lab for a little while.
 I made non-committal noises as we waited in line, all the while scanning the cafeteria for two faces.
 Actually, scanning wasn't the right word for it.
 I just kind of looked that way and instantly found my eyes drawn to Brandon.
 He was surrounded by people, mostly female, all attractive.
 Taking in all of those lithe, tan bodies, I suddenly felt incredibly inferior.
 All of the impending skin cancer deaths suddenly didn't seem quite so important.
 I looked away before anyone could see me staring.
 Britney was still looking longingly at a pile of fries.
 When I looked up again Brandon was looking back at me with a smile that communicated all kinds of things I'd always thought you needed words for.

You still going to that tutoring lab after school?"
 I managed a nod that I thought nearly looked casual.
 "Good, I need to start tracking your movements so you don't keep running me over."
 The rest of lunch and all of history passed in a blur.
 My mind kept returning to Brandon, and the question of why he was taking such an interest in me.
 It wasn't until I'd returned Mrs. Alexander's reference book to its shelf and sat down at my desk that I remembered I'd had to do the entire 'group' project by myself.
 Alec hadn't even bothered to come to Physics since the assignment had been given.
 My entire life I'd had people try and sponge off of my work, and I was way beyond sick and tired of it.
 By the time Alec strode into class looking like the inspiration for every romance novel ever written, I was really mad.
 I hardly waited for him to sit down before I pulled my desk a little closer and hissed at him.

-
Alec actually walked into class, saw Mrs. Alexander wasn't there, and then turned around and left.
 It was possibly the most brazen act of class cutting I'd ever seen, and somehow it didn't surprise me in the least.
 Even so, I spent the rest of the hour stewing while working on the pointless, busywork assignment the sub handed out.
 Mrs. Tiggs still hadn't finished grading our tests, which meant I still had no idea how I'd done.
 By the time I finally half-collapsed at my normal table in the tutor lab, all I could think about was how nice it would be to see Brandon one more time as he drove me home.
 I looked around to verify that all of the usual suspects were there.
 Geeks, check.
 Jocks, check.
 Rachel and her sinister sidekick James, check.
 I smiled at Rachel and then flipped open my math book.

He was never one to hurry about anything, at least not before tonight.
 At that moment, though, his lean body quivered with excitement.
 ‚ÄúMaster," Rodregas said, with a respectful bow, "The prisoners are ready.‚Äù Ravenhurr looked up.
 His eyes passed over Rodregas to glance at the prisoners.
 He nodded without a word and went back to peering through the tube.
 Rodregas had never understood how the stars in the night sky could make the world closer or farther away from the Celestial Realm, where the Gods lived, or how that could affect magic, but he knew the placement of the stars was critical to the success of the ceremony tonight.
 Ravenhurr was an attractive man, like most of the Immortalist Sorcerers.
 After all, if you can pick your body, why would you ever choose an ugly one?
 Rodregas looked over again at the man that he had brought up the stairs.

The prints were shoed, about the size of elves, but the treads were irregular.
 Whatever stayed here, there were a lot of them.
 Near the center of the camp the ground was beat down with tracks, circling a ring of stones.
 I found remnants inside, and ashes.
 A crude fire pit.
 Around that, several feet out, were various logs, I assumed for sitting around the pit for warmth.
 A few huts were situated about the camp but their construction was unlike anything I‚Äôd seen before, very poorly built.
 I ducked inside one and was shocked to see it was full of possessions.
 Clothing, bedding, so much left behind.

Sworn to the All-Father.‚Äù Such an oath could not be challenged here.
 ‚ÄúTruly?‚Äù the sorcerer said.
 ‚ÄúThe Great Oath of Fealty for one of Infernal birth?
 I would see that.‚Äù He turned to Doi‚Äôvan who loomed over all of them.
 Doi‚Äôvan had watched the show with a cold interest.
 The sorcerer spoke with a command that dripped venom, ‚ÄúOn your knees Hellborn and swear the oath of fealty, in the name of the All-Father to this squire where we can all see.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan paused for a heartbeat and then pulled his sword out in a smooth gesture and for a moment Rodregas was thinking that a battle was to be had, but then Doi‚Äôvan dropped to his knees in front of Rodregas.
 He took the sword onto his arms as if in morning sword meditation and spoke the words of the Oath.
 ‚ÄúBy my mortal blood and sweat and tears do I swear my fealty to the Squire Rodregas in the name of the Father of Ocean, Sky and Earth.‚Äù Rodregas nodded and responded as was required, ‚ÄúAs the All-Father protects and guards his people so do I swear to do my best to live up to your oath in the Name of the All-Father.‚Äù Rodregas reached down and picked up the sword across Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs arms and lifted it up.
 ‚ÄúAs I lift your sword up, so do I lift up your honor and make it mine.‚Äù As he finished the oath he handed the sword back to Doi‚Äôvan, who responded with the final, ‚ÄúMy arm shall be your arm, my sword your sword, my honor your honor.‚Äù Rodregas had expected to have to claim his followers as Oath Bond, but a knight would never have demanded to see the oath.
 He felt guilt seize his stomach at having been mistaken and knowing Doi‚Äôvan had been forced to swear the oath, due to not wanting to blow their cover.

For about the tenth time, Karen Flagstad had rejected me, even though a few days before I had warned her that if she wouldn‚Äôt join me at a movie that weekend, I would fast until death.
 From breakfast Monday until late Wednesday afternoon, all I had ingested were three beers and a Coke.
 Then I gobbled two jumbo hamburgers and spent the night consuming aspirins, with my head on two pillows because one alone felt hard as pavement.
 The next day, after Spanish class on Friday, I recounted my ordeal to Karen and explained that all my suffering certainly must have earned me her company at the movies.
 She congenially disagreed.
 While Eric and I drank bourbon and ginger ale, I griped about Karen.
 At first I acted tough and unruffled, but soon the bourbon took hold, and I confessed the pain in my gut that had nothing to do with fasting.
 He asked why I got so obsessed about Karen, knowing I never had pursued anybody else so boldly.
 Should anybody except Karen want a date with me, she had better tell her friend to pass the word along.
 I wouldn‚Äôt even ask any other girl for a dance without having already gotten the nod.

I didn't particularly like them, but it would keep until I was actually hungry, and Mom would count the bottles as a way of determining how many meals I was missing.
 I thought about taking a second bottle, but they were too expensive to pour down a sink, and I knew I wouldn't be hungry enough to finish up the first, let alone a second meal.
 The tinny blare of a car horn pulled me out the front door.
 Britney was waiting outside with her heater going full blast.
 I was surprised at how cold it was with the sun still struggling to get above the mountains.
 Of course it wasn't cold enough for me to need a heater, but I also wasn't wearing Britney's shorts, which looked like they were even shorter than the ones she'd worn the day before.
 It was amazing what the administration was letting everyone get away with.
 Of course, if I had legs like some of these girls, I'd probably be joining in.
 Britney turned down her rap music just long enough to say "Hi", and then we were off to school.
 The music was fairly hideous, but it did spare me having to try and be friendly before I was fully awake.

I had a split second to be grateful I'd lost all of that weight so Britney wouldn't collapse under me, and then the darkness claimed me.
 Even though I knew I wouldn't remember the void when I finally came to, I wanted nothing more than to just float in the darkness.
 It had been a hard day.
 I'd....actually I wasn't sure why it'd been a hard day, but something told me I'd unconsciously been at the end of my rope just before I'd collapsed.
 Unfortunately that same thing told me I couldn't dwell here in the comforting absence, there was a very important reason for me to regain my feet.
 The void was reluctant to let me go, stripping me of memories and experiences as I fought my way free.
 By the time I was near surfacing I no longer remembered just how much I'd wanted to stay.
 Britney was pacing back and forth when I opened my eyes.
 She had her cell phone out and was looking like she wanted to dial 911, but was worried about the possible fallout.
 I was on the ground, which for some reason made me more irritable than it should have.

Mortals, to a greater or lesser extent; have an ability to tap into the mana that has overflowed into our realm from the Celestial, Infernal and Elemental Realms.
 I, for one, believe that if our connections to these realms were cut,‚Äù Jordaan made a motion like knife cutting a loaf of bread, ‚Äúthat in a few years there would not be enough magic for us to use.‚Äù ‚ÄúLuckily, I can think of no way for such a thing to happen.
 But a mortal‚Äôs ability to use mana that has spilled into the mortal world is very limited.
 The Immortalists have overcome this limitation by incorporating certain people‚Äôs direct connection to these realms.
 ‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Jordaan continued, ‚Äúif a mortal can add a Celestial‚Äôs ability to directly tap the Celestial power, he becomes far stronger.
 If the magic user can also tap into the Elemental powers, he again becomes far more powerful.
 Of course, the end goal of the Immortalists is to become a god.
 There are limitations; if an Immortalist were to incorporate a celestial ant‚Äôs connection to the Celestial, he would gain in power.
 But if he were to try to incorporate a thousand ants, he would only gain the same connection as that single ant.
 So instead he might try a butterfly to gain the power of its greater life essence.‚Äù At this point Jordaan paused and he went from an expression of lecturing to one of fearfulness.

"I can't do it, Dad.

 Rough fingers had appeared from outside my peripheral vision, gently smoothing away tears.
 "Come on honey, you really can't expect to do everything by yourself.
 Let's take a break for dinner, and then I'll help you."
 He'd forestalled my next excuse as if reading my mind.

He turned around and studied it.
 Then there was a horrible sound, like ripping metal.

 The winds were so powerful I started to slide toward the body, before I was even close enough.

 He laughed to the others and then punched Harruq in the gut.

 I exchanged a look with Seth, but he looked as clueless as I did.
 None of this felt real.

A detailed study of Pune District in the State of Maharashtra has documented the potential for creating 750,000 jobs through this strategy.
 Extrapolation of these results suggests that the 100 million jobs that India needs to create and the 1 billion needed in the developing world are, indeed, achievable, provided that industrial countries adopt trade policies on agricultural products designed to enhance export opportunities for developing nations.
 International Agenda for Food Security
 The crucial importance of food security to world peace and economic development demands that the international community take collective responsibility and initiative to eradicate hunger and famine on a global basis as a complement to the initiatives of individual countries to deal with the problem domestically.
 The growth of food production in developing countries can be accelerated dramatically by the application of resource-based, location-specific strategies that incorporate a proper blending of traditional and frontier technologies and integrate all the links in the chain of production, processing, transport and distribution.
 Conditions vary too widely from country to country for detailed recommendations to be broadly applied.
 However, a number of strategies are relevant to the majority of developing countries.
 Some of the components of an Action Plan designed to achieve this goal are given below.
 1.Elimination of agricultural trade barriers by industrial nations.
 The agreements reached for liberalizing agricultural trade in the Uruguay Round of GATT are an important step forward, but they will not release the full dynamism of the agricultural sector, which is so critical for more rapid growth of incomes and employment in both developing and developed countries.

p of92m new0m92m agricultural0m markets to challenging underlying soil conditions presents significant challenges, though unique incentives also are faced92m by0m the affected agricultural sector. For particular, the92m United0m States would require China to be a key trade partner under92m a0m policy that would allow its agricultural sector to stay excluded from unusual foreign trading cases until to open

 A harrowing gasp escaped his lips.

That is, you and Doi‚Äôvan?‚Äù Rodregas was caught off guard at the ridiculous question.

Internationally, it has generated intense debate about the reasons for the failure, the efficacy of ‚Äòshock therapy‚Äô, and the appropriateness and adequacy of Western assistance.
 These questions reflect an inadequate understanding, both within and outside the region, of the stages and process and essential conditions for an effective transition under the circumstances prevalent in Eastern Europe at the time.
 Understanding of this failure holds the key not only to the rapid revitalization of the former Soviet and other Eastern European republics, but also to meeting the challenges of present and future transitions in Africa, Asia and the West.
 This understanding can be summarized in the form of several lessons that can be derived from the general experience of countries in the region.
 1.Multi-dimensional transitions cannot be brought about by uni-dimensional strategies: The economic dimension of transition cannot be viewed and acted upon in isolation from its political and social dimensions.
 The reform programme was developed and guided by domestic and foreign economists who viewed the transition much like a change of clothing ‚Äì the casting off of one set of economic principles and the adoption of another ‚Äì ignoring the critical importance of social and political factors.
 This view could be summed up in the often expressed attitude, ‚ÄòGood economics makes good politics!‚Äô
 Transition is the process by which society moves from one form or level of activities to another.
 While social scientists conveniently divide social activity into several categories ‚Äì political, economic, social, educational, religious, cultural ‚Äì in practice these distinctions are at best only partially true.
 Economic activities in any society take place on the foundation of the political system, social values and customs, and the psychological aspirations and attitudes of the people.

s that, to the92m knowledge0m of exceptionally existing economic factors, if a successful transition is often accompanied by the introduction of thorough political, social, and cultural reforms, and since progress if delayed and prone to a worsening of the92m problems0m that has92m a0m developing and increasingly complicated society, it is92m important0m to insist on92m initiating0m

I kept seeing Jason's knives fly off into the woods, or sink into the ground, instead of hitting their mark.
 ‚ÄúAnd now half-ling,‚Äù it whispered with joy, ‚Äúyou die.‚Äù It lunged up at me.
 I had a sudden feeling inside and I stabbed at the creature.
 It tried to change forms to avoid the knife's path but somehow my knife stabbed it anyway.
 It withered and then went still.
 I gasped as the body fell to the ground and even some of the creatures, around stopped.

The minutes crawled, their frantic breathing the only audible sound.
 Qurrah lagged further and further behind, unable to keep the pace.
 Harruq tightened his grip on his wrist and pulled him along.
 The terrain sloped beneath them as they climbed a hill.
 Another quick shift and they were stumbling down that same hill.
 The cold hand vanished.
 The cloud dissipated.
 Before him, standing with his arms crossed, waited Velixar.

 ‚ÄúAnd what would happen if this group of squires tried to take on a Celestial Lion?‚Äù she asked.
 Rodregas started to laugh at the idea and then stopped cold.
 He nodded, he understood her point now.
 The two sat quietly for the remaining minutes.
 The dread in his heart was gone; it had no place in the heart of a lion.
 While no speeches had started the other matches, for the first time Rodregas saw the Grand Marshal himself step forward.
 His name was Faurrenida.
 The Grand Marshal was an older man and not a pretty one; his face had more scars than anything else.

For months she'd been nagging her cousin Tom to bring her here.
 She wasn't quite daring enough to come alone or with a girlfriend; she knew that unescorted women were considered fair game for anything a man might have in mind.
 But she'd been dying to be in the middle of the excitement she was always reading about.
 "Another drink?"
 a waiter asked them.
 "I'd like--" "Marie!"
 She glanced down her nose at Tom and turned back to the waiter.
 "I'll have a Coca Cola."
 She shook her head, telling her cousin, "I'm not stupid, Tom--I know how easy it is to get drunk."
 She'd had one deliciously forbidden cocktail--alcohol had been illegal for seven years now--but that was enough to satisfy her curiosity and yearning for adventure.

In the Second World War, the ratio was one to one.
 In the Korean War, civilian deaths out numbered military losses five to one.
 In the Vietnam War, this ratio rose to 20 to one.
 Advances in the sophistication and dissemination of modern military technology have fuelled this trend.
 The Iran‚ÄìIraq War, the war in Afghanistan and the Gulf War involved the use of ballistic missiles against civilian centres.
 In all, over 5,000 surface-to-surface missiles have targeted population centres during the last five decades.
 The devastating effect of even conventional weapons on economic activity and society in general is so great that today no developed nation can afford the costs of military confrontation, either at home or overseas.
 No longer can non-combatants sit quietly on the sidelines or work productively undisturbed.
 War both between and within states has come to involve and affect all of society.
 Infrastructure and production facilities have become a principal target of military action.

I considered dumping it, but didn‚Äôt think it was the best idea to be sneaking around the forest unclothed.
 After crossing a few soggy patches of moss, the hem was damp and darkened.
 I might have ripped some of the excess material off, but Chevelle‚Äôs movement wasn‚Äôt leaving me time for that.
 Finally, just before nightfall, he approached a small village.
 It didn‚Äôt look like more than half a dozen structures scattered against the base of a large hill.
 He dropped the simple pack he‚Äôd been carrying beside a tree and hunched down as he slowed his pace.
 The stance mirrored mine, and gave me pause.
 He was sneaking into this village.
 I watched as he crept around the back of a small hut, knowing that if he was hiding, I definitely didn‚Äôt want to get caught here.
 He leapt into a rear window and I followed as low and slow as I could.

Plans for transition should cover all of the factors listed above, providing trained personnel to assist in the establishment and initial operation of new institutions and systems.
 7.Plan for institutional development: An assessment of the type and functioning of existing institutions and economic systems should be compiled to identify missing links that need to be provided to support the transition.
 Based on this study, a master plan should be drawn up for establishing the necessary institutions and systems in each country.
 In order to prepare a cadre of managers for private sector industry and institutions, specialized institutes of management should be set up in each country.
 8.Launch a massive programme to impart new skills and attitudes to the population: In countries where private enterprise was extinguished for decades, entrepreneurial, financial and marketing skills can be extremely limited.
 An analysis should be undertaken of the types and levels of skills needed for transition to a market system, covering areas such as entrepreneurship, management, national and international marketing, strategic business planning, finance, quality control, product development, production technology, design, and human resource development.
 Experience in former colonial nations where entrepreneur ship was also stifled for a long period indicates that a profound change in attitude is necessary before people will risk leaving or forego seeking salaried and pensioned jobs in favour of self-employment, even when the salaried jobs are scarce or unavailable.
 Such a basic change of attitude, which normally requires a change of generation, can be accelerated by a massive programme of public information, education and demonstration spanning several years.
 9.Study the benefits of economic recovery on world trade: Recessionary trends are affecting many parts of the world today.
 The prognosis in the West, especially in the European Union, is for slow growth during the 1990s.

Severe fiscal constraints have forced governments to reduce drastically budgetary allocations to research institutions, leaving most of these institutions with little or no source of revenues to support their activities.
 High priority must be given to developing a detailed plan for preservation of the scientific research infra structure during the difficult transition period and for restructuring it so that it can be integrated effectively into the emerging market system.
 The drain of talents must be stopped by a concerted national effort to exploit each country's competitive advantage in science by marketing these capabilities internationally, and particularly by linking up with other countries in the region and with developing countries that can most benefit from the region's scientific and technological capabilities.
 Search for a New Model
 Ironically, despite all the international debate about transition, thus far the actual goal of the transition process has never been clearly spelled out.
 It is widely presumed to be to some form of capitalist system, but which variety ‚Äì the Swedish?
 The Japanese?
 The American?
 Although the ostensible goal of transition has been to economies based on private ownership, three years after the initiation of transition programmes, very little privatization has actually taken place in most countries of the region.
 It is widely believed that acceleration of this process will lead to rising unemployment and a widening gap between the rich and the poor, leading to the creation of a huge under class that had been virtually eradicated in previous decades.

 Donovan's gentle knock and appearance at the door pulled me up short before I could really get going on the self-loathing.

 He limped into the room with his odd, somehow graceful lurch, and then set down a tray filled with eggs, French toast, orange juice and everything else you'd expect if you were to go to IHOP and order their 'everything but the kitchen sink' special.
 While I was still trying to catalog everything on the tray, Donovan laid out a full set of clothes, everything either in unopened manufacturer's plastic bags, or with price tags still attached.
 "Mistress Rachel thought you might desire a change of clothes seeing as how Master Alec carried you off without providing proper time for you to pack your things.
 I pray though that you not think too harshly of him.

Because ‚Äúbelieve in‚Äù denotes more than credulity.
 ‚ÄúBelieve in‚Äù means to fully trust.
 And here we‚Äôre not called to believe in ‚ÄúHim‚Äù but to believe in His name.
 As ‚Äúname‚Äù in the Biblical context refers to character, John is calling us to fully trust in the character of Jesus Christ.
 When we believe in, fully trust certain people, if we have any sense, we will follow their example and not only take what advice they offer but actively seek every piece of wisdom we can wrest out of them.
 If I want to become a baseball star, I should look for a coach or mentor whose character and lessons I can believe in.
 If I believe in Mother Teresa, I should read about her and talk to those who knew her and attend to whatever I learn.
 To the extent that we follow Christ‚Äôs example, give of our selves, our time and resources to help people in need, allow time away from the crowds to contemplate and pray, put aside our self concerns and turn to concern for others, our minds and hearts get invaded and possessed by the Holy Spirit.
 And in that condition, the world transforms before our eyes.
 For passing out food, clothing or loving concern we always get blessed, and while we live with a blessed attitude, the most bedraggled people may appear possessed of astonishing beauty, as God must see them.

 Harruq gave him a funny look, half a piece of bacon still hanging in his mouth.

 But now she knew that she would have adapted.
 She would have married Rick and had children with him and developed the sense of home that she'd missed.
 Marie rocked on her bed, sobbing against her knees.

The man in black stood, pulling the hood back from his face.

 Velixar, however, gave no pause.
 From within his robe he pulled out a handful of bone fragments.

A scale of progression on key skills can help every country identify its relative position, assess the scope for further progress and evolve strategies to fill the gap.
 Raising the skills of society to those of countries higher up on the scale will enable the country to move to that higher level.
 Despite enormous expansion of educational and training institutions, most developing countries suffer from a shortage of quality vocational skills among the huge number of people at lower levels of the society who seek desperately to raise their standard of living.
 This shortage retards the growth in productivity and quality needed to meet domestic needs and achieve international competitiveness.
 The technical training in frastructure in these countries should be expanded by the establishment of craft and vocational training institutes at the local level in every community to impart a wide range of basic technical skills.
 A massive programme of basic vocational and skills training should be launched on a parallel with the 100 per cent literacy programmes that are now being promoted by many governments to wipe out rural illiteracy.
 The military in many developing countries possesses the organizational capabilities and experience with intensive training to assist with this task.
 An institutional gap exists in agricultural training systems.
 In most developing countries, agricultural colleges, universities and polytechnics train researchers, government, bank employees and extension officers, but not farmers.

Alec's hand and fingers had elongated, turning into a hairless replica of the deadly claw that'd terrified me just a few days before.
 Vincent's bulk was such that it screened Alec's movements from passersby, as those razor-sharp claws sank just the barest distance into his chest.
 Alec spoke for the first time, and the even tone of his words was a stark contrast to the winds of power that seemed almost ready to throw me across the hall.
 "You forget yourself, mutt.
 As the leader of another pack, I'm due more respect than that.
 Should you or your dominant wish to push things further, I guarantee that your heart will decorate the floor before he can come to your aid."
 Brandon stopped moving as Alec's words carried to him.
 He was probably weighing odds and tabulating the probable cost of the various courses of action available to him.
 Vincent's life was likely a relatively small component in the grand equation.
 Dominic's presence as she stepped around the corner seemed to be the deciding factor.

His kiss was almost irresistible, but she was hurting too much to stay in his arms.
 Breaking off the kiss, she stood and turned away from him as tears poured down her cheeks.

 Wiping her face, she turned to look at him.

It was Jim Dickinson who dubbed Buddy ‚ÄúSlipshod,‚Äù not because Buddy was a sloppy player but because he put together such sloppy groups around him.
 It mattered not to Buddy who was playing behind him.
 He was lost in the ether, playing for his own private gods, letting the Lydian reverberation carry him away, the sound coming from his own self, you see.
 Oh, of course, he knew when the bassist was faking it, or the drummer tripping over himself to keep up, or the rhythm guitarist playing the same three chords over and over, hoping his stroking would be lost in the thunder.
 Buddy knew it, but he didn‚Äôt care.
 He was soaring.
 He was making music, Memphis music, as sacred a calling as one could imagine.
 Eventually, Buddy found his grounding, a group almost as flexuous and capable as Buddy, though few could approach Buddy‚Äôs genius for the ineffable, that secret other place he could go with his music.
 Black Lung was born in the mid-sixties in an abandoned gas station when a bass player named Crafty Connor was introduced to Buddy through the coagulant Sid Selvidge.
 Memphis music bred Memphis music, is how Sid describes it today.

You now also have some chain that should fit over your leather armor.‚Äù Imeralda added, ‚ÄúI was able to recover only about a score of the arrows, but I have been working with some of the wood nymphs and the armorer and we now have a full set of arrows again.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan, at her motion towards his armor, picked up the pile of chain mail and tried it over his head.
 The opening on top actually fit over his huge head.
 Doi‚Äôvan guessed that it had been the chain of the large overweight slaver that he had killed.
 While the equipment was all of average quality, Rodregas was smiling because clearly there were three sets of everything plus a pack horse for equipment.
 Imeralda was clearly planning on joining them.
 While that is what his heart hoped for he was not sure if it was the smartest move.
 When they were working on the tack for the horses, he went ahead and asked.
 ‚ÄúImeralda, I want to make sure you want to continue with us.
 I mean I love to travel with you, but while Doi‚Äôvan and I are warriors, when you joined us it was only as a travel companion.

It can‚Äôt be a sigil, can it?‚Äù she asked.
 Neither Doi‚Äôvan nor Rodregas answered and the three of them stood there, each caught up in their own thoughts.
 Finally, Doi‚Äôvan spoke, ‚ÄúI am going to see what lies in this Chamber.
 Will you be alright?‚Äù he asked Imeralda.
 She nodded and seemed relieved as she headed right for the doorway of the One Tree.
 Rodregas feared for her.
 He was not sure what the consequences would be if she touched the One Tree.
 He wanted to follow her, but he followed Doi‚Äôvan into the Infernal chamber instead.
 ‚ÄúWas it his own Infernal power calling him?‚Äù He wondered.

From his wounds Rodregas guessed he had been injured during the sword and shield competition.
 To Rodregas‚Äô relief no one was paying them any attention, not even to Doi‚Äôvan.
 Rodregas and Doi‚Äôvan did their best to block the view of others as Imeralda gathered the limp pale hand that should have belonged to an old man, not a young one, and slipped the small frog figurine into it.
 Quickly she channeled the power.
 Rodregas could feel the instinctive rise of the young man‚Äôs own power.
 Then the squire started to squirm weakly in pain.
 Both Doi‚Äôvan and Rodregas reached out and steadied the young man until it was over.
 Imeralda straightened the sheets for the young squire.
 She then led Rodregas and Doi‚Äôvan to the figure of a woman.
 She was short and muscular and older than average for the tournament.

For half a second the torrent of sensation was too strong to leave room for conscious thought.
 I realized I'd closed my eyes to better savor the experience.
 When I opened them Alec's expression had moved from annoyance to sadness.
 I had a pair of heartbeats to wonder at the strange tricks my subconscious was playing on me, and then the dream started fading away.
 The heavenly surroundings were predictably the first thing to disappear, leaving afterimages of light burned into the corners of my vision.
 Alec was the next thing to go, but the memory of his features clung to my mind long after I found myself in a featureless void.
 Stranger still, his scent stayed with me even longer.
 I was just self-aware enough to hope I'd remember it all when I awoke in the morning.

But it turned out to be completely unlike the night of their betrothal.
 Davis was in an abominable mood, complaining about the food, the service, even the color of the tablecloth.
 And he was too tired to go dancing after dinner.
 "Can we at least go for a walk by the river?"
 Marie asked as they left the restaurant.

When he noticed her glance, she dropped her eyes to the bread she was buttering.

 "I wanted you to kiss me then."
 "I know."
 When she looked up in astonishment, he explained, "I wouldn't have kissed you if you hadn't wanted me to.

Rodregas was surprised to find a pile of equipment outside his door the next morning, and Imeralda sorting through the pile.
 It appeared to be mostly their equipment plus miscellaneous pieces of slaver gear.
 Doi‚Äôvan stood watching, clearly not sure what to make of it.
 When Rodregas tried to apologize Imeralda ignored him and instead said, ‚ÄúWe traded the Immortal Guard equipment for safe harbor here at the village for healing.
 But, of course, there were also regular slaver guards and I claimed their equipment and any money that was in their personal money pouches.‚Äù ‚ÄúYour armor got pretty chopped up,‚Äù she continued, ‚Äúand Doi‚Äôvan did not have any armor to start with.
 I have been trading excess gear and coins to repair armor and to refit some of the other armor to fit Doi‚Äôvan and yourself.
 We still had our three horses, but none of them were too great to begin with; the two were good for pulling carriages, the other was too old.‚Äù ‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù Rodregas said nodding his agreement.
 ‚ÄúJordaan knows horse flesh,‚Äù she went on, ‚Äúand we were able to trade the three old horses for one of the Immortal Guards‚Äô horses.

Let us hearken back, briefly, to those days when music was being made because it was important, because genius finds its own level, because people needed godhead, if that‚Äôs not overstating it.
 Before the drugs, the recriminations, the lawsuits, the doubting of the very fiber of what the 60s meant to Memphis, to these sweet souls herein, and to the world at large.
 Let us reimagine it, if we can, in all its efflorescence.
 In all its pied beauty.
 Let‚Äôs hear again, ‚ÄúTurntable Poison‚Äù as if for the first time and marvel at the voice that said, ‚ÄúWe are all naked.‚Äù  That said, ‚ÄúLove me for my limo but love me all the way.‚Äù  And, that said, presciently, ‚ÄúDeath is only a way station, between West Memphis and the coast.‚Äù These interviews were done in three sessions in early 1973, in San Francisco, by Creole Myers, at Buddy Gardner‚Äôs home.
 Lorelei Enos was in and out.
 One of the startling revelations found in these tapes is that Lorelei was with Buddy until the end.
 Rumors had her abandoning him after they had left Memphis for Los Angeles.
 Stories circulated back home about her, unflattering stories all, about her working in the pornographic film industry, about her fixing Buddy that final fix, about her leaving him for a slick-talking Hollywood casting agent.
 What is made clear here is her devotion to him and his to her.

Nothing that mattered yesterday mattered anymore.
 My gut felt as if a big snake were coiled inside it.
 My heart was a huge lump of coal.
 I walked faster and groaned and wondered why I couldn‚Äôt weep.
 I thought of how Eric was ten times the human I would ever be.
 If he couldn‚Äôt become Superman, I estimated my chances equaled about the square root of zero.
 Mystery
 All these years, I have believed that in some vaguely Christ-like way, Eric died as a sacrifice.
 I reasoned like this: From at least two months away, he saw a big change approaching.
 As it neared, he apprehended it ever more clearly.

Britney most definitely didn't want to be stuck riding the bus with all of the junior high kids and other assorted 'losers'.
 Her mouth opened and closed several times and then she nodded and fled the classroom.
 When I finally caught up with her she'd recovered enough to complain, but there was a breathless nature to her voice that told me she wouldn't be skipping the math lab for a little while.
 I made non-committal noises as we waited in line, all the while scanning the cafeteria for two faces.
 Actually, scanning wasn't the right word for it.
 I just kind of looked that way and instantly found my eyes drawn to Brandon.
 He was surrounded by people, mostly female, all attractive.
 Taking in all of those lithe, tan bodies, I suddenly felt incredibly inferior.
 All of the impending skin cancer deaths suddenly didn't seem quite so important.

 From her expression she meant what she said, but Rodregas did not think she was happy to say it.

‚ÄúHis energy came from someplace else.‚Äù At any rate in early 1970, having witnessed the death of some of the gods, Buddy Gardner turned his back on Memphis, moved to L.A. with Lorelei, who then just as suddenly disappeared.
 Like a genii whose work is done.
 Some say she turned to making porno films.
 Some say she works in television.
 Some say she went back to perdition from whence she came.
 But it was in L.A. that Buddy transformed himself into a folk artist, a singer/songwriter with a heart on his sleeve and an ace up it.
 He was as mellow as yellow, as smooth as California sunshine.
 And as empty as a bird‚Äôs nest in December.
 His two albums, ‚ÄúI Was a Child When Smaller,‚Äù and ‚ÄúRain and other Distractions,‚Äù were mega-sellers.

 While the two of us might be a match for most of the sigil warriors‚Äô one on one, their equipment will make them hard to beat.‚Äù ‚ÄúI agree that has to be something we figure out,‚Äù Rodregas said, ‚Äúbut, I am actually thinking decent horses might be more important first.‚Äù ‚ÄúHorses?
 How will that help us in battle?‚Äù asked Doi‚Äôvan.
 Rodregas responded, ‚ÄúWell, a true trained war horse can help directly, but what I am worried about is escaping after an attack.
 Even if we have a successful raid against an Immortalist, we will need to be far away before a large group of The Immortal Guard can track us down.
 The Immortal Guards, or at least their officers, use Dire Steeds.
 If we are mounted on regular horses and they come after us on Dire Steeds, well, they will track us down and outnumber us the first time we strike.‚Äù  Doi‚Äôvan nodded at that.

I knew that the wavy vertical line off the side was destined to become a waterfall.
 The scene was starting to take shape, but for the first time in ages I still couldn't place it.
 A mossy boulder filled itself in with feathery detail, and then I realized the center of the piece was still blank.
 It was like my subconscious hadn't ever seen that part of the landscape.
 Only that didn't make sense.
 How could I not have seen part of whatever it was I was looking at?
 Unless it'd been blocked by something.
 But if so I would have drawn whatever it was that'd been in the foreground.

 He was shaking his head again.

Maybe the information about the rest of her life wouldn't appear until she returned.
 And maybe she wouldn‚Äôt marry Davis when she returned.

Taking his hand as they returned to their blanket, she asked, "Are you feeling all right, Rick?"
 "Yeah, I'm fine."
 "Why don't we go home so you can rest since you have to go to work tomorrow?"
 "It's still early."
 "We've been here several hours already.
 Let's go home and read the paper and nap and order a pizza tonight.
 Then maybe you won't feel tired tomorrow."
 He slid his arm around her waist, pulling her against him.
 "I love you so much," he said as he bent to kiss her.
 They went home, but Rick couldn't read, couldn't rest, wasn't hungry.

His twin swords itched in his hands.
 Qurrah, sitting next to him in a little back alley next to Ahrqur‚Äôs old home, laughed.
 ‚ÄúSo eager to kill, brother?
 I was beginning to think you had grown soft.‚Äù
 The bigger half-orc smashed his swords together, focusing on the pain the shower of sparks caused his hands.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still who I‚Äôve always been,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see.‚Äù
 Qurrah‚Äôs smile faded at the ferocity in his brother‚Äôs words.
 He glanced down, his mind spinning and reeling.
 ‚ÄúTell me if you love her,‚Äù Qurrah suddenly ordered.

Brandon seemed to sense my unease, and flashed another gentle smile.
 "I just wanted to find out if you had a way home tonight after you finished up with your math stuff."
 Britney was almost jumping up and down.
 "Oh, don't worry, Brandon, I'll give Adri a ride home.
 The poor thing lives all the way out in the Anderson home.
 I've been giving her a ride into school and home almost every day since she moved."
 Brandon was still smiling, but I got the feeling that it was a little more forced.
 "Perfect.

"How about brunch and a movie then?"
 "That sounds great."
 Rick felt good about the evening and was looking forward to seeing Sharon again the next day.
 The only down side was the report that Ted would expect Monday morning.
 "How'd things go yesterday?"
 was the greeting he got at exactly 8:47 Monday morning.
 "Fine.
 I read and napped, watched a little TV.

"Because Lauri's as good at badgering as I am.
 See you tomorrow."
 Rick shook his head as Ted left his office.
 He knew his friend meant well, but he despised fix-ups.
 The last time he'd gone to Ted and Lauri's, Lauri had spent fifteen minutes scolding him for letting his date go home alone.
 She'd been a nice enough girl, but she'd had her own car at dinner, and it would have been totally ridiculous for him to offer to drive her home.
 According to Lauri, however, Beth would have accepted the offer and returned later to get her car, just for the chance to be alone with him.
 He was glad then that he hadn't offered.
 How could he respect a woman who would do something so silly?
 Restless now, Rick began wrapping up for the day.

Father clearly prefers me, but sometimes I wonder if that is really better.
 She wanders idly around the castle, no practice, no duties, no formal gatherings.
 Magic practice, castles, who was this girl?
 I read the entries for hours.
 Ruby must have thought I was sleeping.
 I had no idea what in this journal could be of interest to Chevelle unless he knew the woman, and that kept me reading.
 It continued on‚Äîher father‚Äôs rigorous schedule, their distaste for her sister‚Äîand then the entries got more detailed and frequent.

"He hasn't always been crippled.
 In fact he used to be a delightful dancer.
 His injuries were sustained at the hands of the individuals who killed Alec's father, the same ones who wanted to kill me, and who tortured Donovan for days before finally accepting that I'd died from the wounds that left me like this."
 Mallory shrugged, slowly and painfully in response to my questioning look.
 "My scars aren't readily visible, but they're there.
 That's why Alec is forced to come move the food he has sent to me.

Father has been merciless in my practice and testing with Rune.
 Unrelenting sessions are wearing on me.
 I can barely concentrate.
 I don‚Äôt have the energy for the simplest tasks, let alone the new and wild trials he‚Äôs created.
 He thinks he has to test every possible idea he has or else he won‚Äôt know what I might be capable of.
 He‚Äôs gone much more often lately, but Rune doesn‚Äôt let up in his absence.
 I wish there was a way to handle him, some way he‚Äôd give me a break when Father was away.
 I can think of nothing short of begging, and that would only result in punishment.

He put a finger to his lips and pointed in front of him.
 I crept up and peered at where he was pointing.
 A bunch of dwarves and tall, muscular men crowded around something.
 The men had double swords sheathed on their back, long ears, and long black hair.
 They were wearing some type of combat boots and thick coats.
 One of them moved and I saw a tied dragon staked to the ground.
 It continued to try to stand but it seemed to weak and fell back down.
 I heard Emily gasp in horror and I felt the same way.
 One of the men poked it in the side with the butt of his sword and the dragon grunted in pain.
 I looked over my shoulder at Emily.

Neither of us moved for several seconds, and then he turned towards me with a glare.
 "Go away!"
 The command was so forceful it was almost more than I could do to stop myself from turning and running away in terror, but I held my ground.
 "Leave.
 Leave now and I won't follow you."
 The anger was still there, but now there were other emotions, one of which I could identify, one of which I knew how to handle.

He was asleep!
 She lay there for a few more minutes, but she was too restless to keep lying still, especially with no one to talk to.
 So at last she jumped up and ran into the waves.
 Rick woke up slowly with no idea of how long he'd been asleep.
 It had been an exhausting week, and he'd gotten less sleep than usual.
 Of course, he'd had much more fun than usual too, he thought with a lazy smile.
 He turned to see if Marie was asleep.
 She wasn't there!

Good enough for the common soldier, but I fancy something a little more distinctive.‚Äù Rodregas was about to ask him what he had in mind when they found out why they had been waiting; two more slavers came up with drawn bows.
 They were going to take them from a safe distance.
 Doi‚Äôvan and he needed no words; they both knew only instant action gave them a chance.
 Rodregas would like to have tried to take on one of the Immortal Guards, but he had already noticed that the slaver with the mace was a little too close and a little too far away from his nearest companion.
 He was a skinny man with dirty hair and seemed to be having trouble holding his heavy weapon.
 Rodregas stepped in close and the slaver swung the mace with surprising force, but he met it with the shield and knocked it aside.
 Rodregas moved with simply too much speed to be blocked.
 He slid the short sword into the slaver‚Äôs stomach and gutted him in a quick and vicious move.
 Doi‚Äôvan immediately launched himself at the next slaver, and followed suit, slamming his opponent‚Äôs sword away and gutting him before he had a chance to move.
 Rodregas then went for the nearest Immortal Guard.

In the dark before the dawn, it seemed he would receive no answer.
 At last, he could travel no more.
 He had no food, no destination, and no company.
 His limbs were weak and his head throbbed.
 To his knees he slumped, and he let time pass and his strength return, while his mind rummaged for ideas of how to proceed.

Pete proved to be a bad choice of a business partner, as his use of cocaine escalated to the point of total addiction.
 In less than a year he would snort everything he could get his hands on.
 He was stealing money from the checking account and drop-shipping inventory from our business directly to drug dealers to feed his habit.
 My own brother Thomas was one of the many drug dealers receiving this merchandise for pennies on the dollar in exchange for cocaine and marijuana.
 This would be one of the many actions that would drive a wedge between Thomas and me as drugs and money started to always come before family.
 It hurt me deeply to contemplate Thomas‚Äôs complete disregard for our relationship as brothers and his choice to take this merchandise from my addicted partner while knowing full well that it would financially destroy my business and thus me.
 Pete had already disappeared for several weeks when I discovered what he was doing, but it was too late and the business closed within a month after the invoices for all of these portable spas and waterbeds started arriving.
 The checking account had been completely drained of any operating capital.
 Bad business partner, and bad best friend: My girlfriend at the time, Karen, had hidden her drug habit from me, and by the time I discovered it she had emptied our joint savings account and was screwing my ex-partner/best friend, Pete.
 They were both very addicted to cocaine and I guess they belonged together because neither one of them belonged with me.

I‚Äôd need something dreadful, a new tactic to convince him.
 A tiny snake sunning on a nearby rock caught my eye and I smiled.
 Some part of me knew what had happened before, had felt it.
 I could do it again.
 I slipped the tip of the sword down to the tracker‚Äôs leg, just above where his knee met the ground, and sliced his trousers up to the thigh to reveal bare skin.
 Drawing the snake close with magic, I took it in my hand, its thin green body writhing over my left palm, the sword grasped in my right.
 The prisoner watched me, almost smug.
 It was a small snake, its white belly confirming it was nonvenomous, its frame no thicker than my pinkie, but it would do.
 I slid the tip of the sword across the skin above the man‚Äôs knee, making a narrow incision.
 His expression did change then, giving way to uncertainty.

 She was a heavy woman and her girth made her seem even shorter than she was.

 Grandma worked at a department store named Zodies.
 On occasion, my mother would take us to the store to visit her on her break.
 We would run from aisle to aisle searching for her brightly colored smock.
 One of the few times I ever remember eating out was when we shared her lunch break and ate hot dogs and popcorn at the department store cafeteria.
 I still think of Grandma whenever I walk into a discount store and smell the snack bar.

I was far from an expert on roses, but I'd looked through pictures of hundreds of different kinds of tea roses, and never seen anything quite like this one.
 It was as big as some of the largest specimens I'd seen, and had at least fifty percent more petals than most of the 'very full' varieties I was familiar with.
 That in and of itself was pretty amazing, but nothing in comparison to the petals themselves.
 They were the purest white edged in a breathtaking purple.
 Equally amazing was just how velvety they were.
 They looked like the softest thing in the world, and cried out to be touched.
 I expected to be disappointed as I leaned in.
 Most of the prettiest roses aren't actually very fragrant.
 This one proved a surprise.

Imeralda‚Äôs eyes lit up in pleasure and humor at his words but, of course, he was careful to say nothing of the future, nothing of love.
 Such talk would serve no purpose and would likely ruin the moment.
 To his surprise she also kept such thoughts to herself.
 The rest of the night, the two lovers spent quietly connected and at peace, but they shared few words.
 In the morning after meditation, Doi‚Äôvan pulled forth two wooden staves that he had cut and said with a smile and an exaggerated wink, ‚ÄúApparently you are healed up from your wound now, so I think it is time to stop with these making of shadows like children and time for some more physical training.‚Äù As he finished speaking he tossed Rodregas one of the staves.
 ‚ÄúWith my people we teach our children to fight using the staff.
 It is hard to kill someone by accident with a staff, but you can still deliver pain.
 The avoidance of pain is a great way to teach someone to be nimble and quick.
 My war masters at the palace would say you two are too old to learn the staff, but it is the way that I know.‚Äù ‚ÄúSir Paladin,‚Äù he said to Rodregas, imposing the unearned honor title.

It surprised me, as did his request.
 I had a perverted desire to let him.

 He took that as an invitation, leaning closer, his hand raised to touch my face.
 His thumb caressed the line of my jaw as he reached around, fingers tangling in my braids as he drew me to him.
 He started gently, teasing, and then crushed our lips together, his strong hand holding me there, his breathing ragged.
 At some point, I became aware of what I was doing.
 I drew back.

Meat consumption in China has tripled since 1978 and is expected to more than double again over the next two decades.
 Sugar consumption in developing countries is currently less than half the average of industrial nations.
 In India, sugar consumption is projected to rise from 13 kg to more than 25 kg, generating a demand for a 100 per cent increase in sugar cane production, the establishment of 300 to 400 new sugar mills in the country and the creation of 3 to 4 million new jobs in this industry alone.
 Worldwide, raising the average level of sugar consumption in developing countries could generate tens of millions of additional jobs in agriculture, industry and services.
 Viewing the future demand for food from this perspective reveals a tremendous opportunity.
 Vast sections of humanity now aspire to the higher quantity, wider variety and greater nutritional content of food once consumed only by the wealthy.
 An effort to raise nutritional standards in the developing countries nearer to the levels prevalent among industrial countries will not only eradicate hunger, but also dramatically spur economic growth, employment, and purchasing power among the rural poor, stimulating growth of production and jobs in industry and services, as well as increasing exports and imports.
 Raising the entire world population to the level of the prosperous nations would require a 72 per cent increase in total world food production, measured in terms of calories.
 In order to meet the people‚Äôs nutritional requirements for fruit and vegetables, India‚Äôs production of these crops needs to double within the next decade.
 Achieving that high level will generate more than six million new jobs in the country.

92m combining0m natural gas with gasoline and diesel for the first time since 1980 will account for a quarter of the total increase in the production of natural gas annually92m.0m India‚Äôs renewable energy also would be expected to generate more than eight million new jobs and greatly brighten92m the0m way92m for0m electricity generation.92m<eop>0m<eod> A.

I almost took a step back when he turned towards me.
 "I realize it's unreasonable to ask you to trust me right now, but I'm going to need you to do so.
 Can you remain quiet for the next few minutes?"
 I wanted to ask why, but it was obvious we didn't have the time for a lengthy explanation.
 I nodded.
 "I trust you.
 After everything you've done, I know you wouldn't hurt me."
 Alec turned towards Rachel, but she shook her head before he could even open his mouth.

They all disappeared into a stand of eucalyptus.
 Most of the teachers and ROTC tailed behind.
 Others returned to the basketball game, leaving Billy, Eric and me unguarded.
 We slipped away, into the shadows beside a row of classrooms.
 As we stood there assessing our options, Eric said, ‚ÄúGet Billy out of here.‚Äù He pointed to a parking lot.
 ‚ÄúGo down there and hide till you can hitch a ride.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre going to find Kenny?‚Äù I asked.

She grew warm imagining a pleasure greater than what he'd made her feel a few minutes ago.

 "You wish what?"
 When she didn't respond, he tilted her chin up, making her look into his eyes.
 "Stay here, Marie.

"The marriage was apparently an unhappy one.
 Marie, who had, in her youth, had a reputation as a vibrant, fun-loving, somewhat mischievous girl, was rarely seen in public after her marriage.
 Reports suggest that she was a victim of spousal abuse.
 The official cause of her death in 1941 was an infection contracted during the birth of her youngest child.
 However, that child was born in 1936, so it is highly unlikely that she had a terminal infection for five years.
 Rumors at the time suggested that her husband had transmitted a venereal disease to her."
 Rick was shocked.
 He had a hard time picturing the young woman in the picture as a victim.
 Of course, even today women stayed with men who abused them, and it would have been much harder for a woman in the 1920s to escape.

 CHET Whispers From the Past
 By Larry Murray
 Meet Charles Tucker, he has spent nearly 30 years living in denial, trying desperately to hide from his past and the events that shattered his heart beyond any possibility of healing.
 He can't let anyone close, for doing so would open him up to being hurt again, and there's no way he could survive another wounding.
 Meet the Saunders family, new to the neighborhood and teetering on the verge of bankruptcy.
 Mark, the father, talks a good story but is that all he is?
 His plan could hold the key to reversing his family's financial misfortunes, or it could wipe out everyone involved.

Things only got worse as I'd aged, presumably because I wasn't really as indifferent as I liked to pretend, and I couldn't hide behind the excuse of being too young to be asked anymore.
 My pulse had already skyrocketed; I almost didn't hear what Rachel was saying over the pounding in my ears.
 "...of course it's still a little ways away, but a girl like Britney starts early so she gets as high up the social food chain as possible."
 Rachel's words calmed me a little at the same time they sparked confusion.
 I'd never heard her be quite so cynical.
 It was completely at odds with the innocent, accepting exterior she usually displayed.
 My surprise must have leaked through.
 Almost as soon the thought crossed my mind Rachel's demeanor crossed back from the older, jaded visage, to one that was more youthful, even embarrassed.
 "Sorry, I know she's your friend.
 I shouldn't say things like that, but that's really what she's doing.

Apparently the sound of my voice was at least slightly reassuring, she was only a little wild-eyed by the time she opened the door and stuck her head in my room.
 "Oh, there you are, dear.
 I was worried you were gone."
 I forced a chuckle.
 "Please, Mom.
 Where else would I be?
 Saturdays are one of my only two chances all week to actually sleep in.
 It isn't like I'm going to climb out of bed at the crack of dawn and go hiking or something."
 Mom's chuckle was almost genuine.

I wondered.
 It would be another day of bombardment with mountain fixtures‚Ä¶ maybe whole trees this time.
 My face pinched with annoyance and Chevelle threw me a piece of dried meat, barely holding back a smile as he jumped on his horse.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd better get started,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs going to be a long walk.‚Äù As he kicked his heels, I spun toward the corner where my horse had been.
 He was galloping up the mountain now, just over a hundred yards away.
 I tried to think quickly, to keep the anger from slowing my response.
 Using magic to pull Chevelle‚Äôs horse by the tail, I ran after him, hoping to leap on.
 A tree branch came from nowhere and smacked me flat across the face.
 Chevelle‚Äôs horse whinnied as they rode away.

 Alec stopped and tugged me around to face him.
 "Don't be sorry.
 I wish this had happened a long time ago.
 We kept stalling, kept waiting for me to develop the ability to stand Brandon off, and it was the wrong thing to do.

The hour is still in progress.
 There is still time and that time is now.
 The world today has far greater opportunities that ever before, far greater degrees of freedom within which to act to accelerate progress and eradicate suffering.
 The Millennium Development Goals adopted at the UN Millennium Summit in 2000 represent the essential minimum needs for building a stable, secure, free and prosperous global community.
 We confront once again an unprecedented opportunity and an unfinished agenda.
 Disappointed by our failure to achieve all that seemed possible or disillusioned by the emergence of new, more dreadful challenges, some may feel prompted to curb mind‚Äôs contemplation of the greater potentials, dispense with lofty plans and resign themselves to the slower, circuitous pace of progress that characterized earlier periods.
 That choice would be unfortunate.
 For everything in our experience of the past two decades points to the fact that humankind is now capable of more rapid and radical action to build a better common present and future for all.
 We may have become habituated to the astounding magnitude of the events since 1989 and still feel unsatisfied with the results, but we can no longer deny that we collectively possess the capacity to create the world that we choose to create.
 This is still the hour in which anything can happen, provided we are determined to make it happen.

 The town held only ninety members, half of them younger than eighteen.

 "They don't hate you.

 As she'd promised when she'd invited them, Teri had made a Chinese meal.
 "House rules: you have to spend at least 15 minutes using chopsticks," she told them as they sat down to dinner.
 "After that, you can have a fork if you want."
 Marie had eaten in Chinese restaurants in 1927, so she managed with the chopsticks.
 The meal was enjoyable, but she couldn't keep her thoughts from wandering to Rick.
 His neck looked so warm and inviting.
 She wanted to bury her face in the crook of his neck and shoulder.

Qurrah lurched awake, gasping for air.

 The night was still deep and the town quiet.
 Beside him, Harruq snored loud enough to wake the drunkest of men.
 Far away, a wolf howl beckoned.

They sat on the ground and waited until Imeralda signaled that something was coming.
 Rodregas neither heard nor saw any activity and his physical senses were far more accurate than when he had been a young man.
 His guess was that her connection with the forest had somehow warned her that something was coming.
 Doi‚Äôvan and Rodregas looked at each other as they squatted down in the shrubs.
 Doi‚Äôvan had one of the Black Yew bows out, with arrows at hand, if needed.
 It would not be surprising if a patrol of the Immortal Guard would be on the road.
 The road was the main route from the port city of Chrisana Stone to the Menagerie of Sky, Earth and Water; the slave city run by the Immortalist Taiga.
 Most likely what Imeralda sensed was simply a trade caravan running a regular route from Chrisana Stone to any of several of the Eastern Realms cities.
 If it was a light scouting patrol of just two or three guards that was coming; it would be the best case scenario for them to take on some Immortalist Guards and gain better weapons, armor and horses.
 Of course, if it was a slave caravan then they would simply sit and watch, as it would be suicide to do anything against a full patrol.

The threats to future peace come in many forms and at many levels, but unquestionably the most pernicious and potentially devastating is the peril from nuclear weapons.
 The end of the nuclear arms race between the superpowers may have removed the looming fear of all-out nuclear war and annihilation that surfaced in the artistic drawings of young American school children in the mid-1980s, but the horrible genie of Hiroshima and Nagasaki will continue to haunt us until every nuclear weapon has been destroyed.
 The very existence of the nuclear stock piles carries its own inherent dynamism for their utilization, which is likely to be expressed intentionally or accidentally sooner or later.
 There have been repeated efforts by the non-aligned nations to move a resolution in the UN General Assembly that the use of nuclear weapons should be declared a crime against humanity and outlawed.
 One hundred and twenty-six nations have voted for the resolution.
 It is ironic that the opposition to this resolution and justification for the continued possession and possible use of nuclear weapons come solely from the most militarily, politically and economically powerful group of nations, which are militarily without adversary and at the same time in the best position to afford and institute alternative means for their national security.
 Here lies the real key: the insistence of the few most powerful nations on perceiving security in their own terms, and their insatiable urge to achieve ever more of it for themselves at the expense of greater insecurity for others and the world as a whole, even though their goal can never be achieved on this unilateral basis.
 During the Cold War, nuclear weapons were legitimized by the five permanent members of the Security Council which are the nuclear weapon states.
 Now that it is over, the governments of these nations seek to justify continued possession and the option to use these weapons, even while exerting every possible pressure to stop proliferation to other countries.
 The very logic which the nuclear weapon states rely on to support this policy, however, makes the acquisition of these weapons extremely attractive to non-nuclear powers.

everyone that has made statements92m about0m92m the0m fall out from national defense with92m the0m nuclear weapons of the world has generally agreed that these weapons: should not be central to national92m defense0m and that these weapons ought to be nationalulated further back and for a longer period of time, the absence of any92m legitimate0m reason to fight our

 His eyes moved down to the pendant against my chest and then quickly back to my face, as if he had committed an indiscretion.
 We sat there for a few more moments, but my words would not return, not with this imposing stranger inches before me.
 When he finally spoke again, I realized his offer of help wasn‚Äôt a request.
 ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs begin with histories.‚Äù He flicked the middle finger of his left hand and a thick ivory tome flew from a shelf, opened, and steadied between us as if on a table.

Outsourcing: During the last decade enormous attention has been focused on the lucrative employment potentials generated by Information and Communication Technology (ICT), particularly the high paid jobs in computer software and hardware and the less technical jobs in business process outsourcing.
 Countries such as India have shown that they can leapfrog into the technological vanguard by developing qualified human resources to meet the ever-expanding shortage in these sectors.
 Information Technology and IT-enabled services stand out as the most important new fields of employment to emerge since the popularization of the automobile.
 While the Commission‚Äôs report anticipated the importance of the information superhighway even before the World Wide Web radically transformed global communications, information exchange and commerce, ICPF did not foresee the dramatic impact that the Internet would have on the future export of service jobs to developing countries.
 The West has been exporting manufacturing jobs in large numbers for half a century, fuelling the growth of Japan, the East Asia tigers, and more recently China; but until the emergence of the information superhighway, the scope for export of service jobs was limited.
 Technological development has changed that.
 As a result, business process outsourcing has become one of the fastest growing sectors of the world economy.
 As growth of the labour force slows in high-income countries, there will be increasing pressure for export of service jobs.
 Public concern in the West over the rapid growth of outsourcing is fuelled by the common misconception that employment is a zero sum game.
 A recent authoritative study of the impact of IT outsourcing found that the direct gains to the US economy in the form of additional jobs in other fields, higher real wages, higher real GDP growth, contained inflation and expanded exports far outweigh the losses.

Rick drew her into his arms, feeling torn apart himself.
 He couldn't bear the thought of losing her.
 But he hated seeing her miserable.
 "Marie," he said softly, stroking her hair, "you've been here for over five weeks.
 You've walked in the garden almost every morning.
 What if you can't get back?
 What if--" "Don't say that!"

 Alec's mom was tiny.
 It was easy to see where Rachel got her slight frame from, but there was more than just genetics at work.
 I'd never seen someone with so little extra flesh on their bones, at least not outside a hospital.
 It seemed she should be wearing a hospital gown instead of the white, flower-print summer dress I was almost sure cost more than my whole wardrobe.

 Jasmin interrupted before I could say anything.
 "Any slower and you'd have been cut off from the rest of us by those mutts."
 My confusion must have been obvious.

 "Vincent and Cassie cut Jess and Isaac off from the rest of us."
 Rachel leaned in so she could whisper.
 "Jess is terrified of what Vincent and Brandon will do to her if they get a chance.

 But there was no way he could find out.

I glanced back to Chevelle.
 He was watching me.
 I wanted to ask if this was where he was from, but was afraid to set off any conversation that might end with me being hauled back to council that much quicker.
 I looked again out over the lake to the mountains.
 If I was incarcerated for a thousand years in the village, I would want this memory.
 I breathed deep; the air was cool, moist, and smelled so unlike the harsh floral scents that saturated every part of the village.
 I could sense the deep green moss covering the rocks at my feet, the fir trees that edged the east bank.
 Even the soil smelled richer.
 My eyes were closed as I took it in, and a soft touch brushed my cheek.

We were gliding high up in the eerie sky and the view was actually beautiful.
 The trees looked like an endless sea of lush green and the sun peeked out from behind the clouds.
 I felt the urge to hold my arms out like they do in those movies so I could feel the wind on my arms.
 It was already making my hair flap all over the place.
 I heard Seth huff out and I turned.
 He gave me a face and said, ‚ÄúYour hair keeps getting in my face.‚Äù I turned back around.
 ‚ÄúDeal.‚Äù We turned in the air and I could see the mountains in the distance.
 They were small but were growing fast as we neared them.
 I could feel the dragon‚Äôs muscles pump underneath my legs.
 Small gusts of air rolled off the dragon‚Äôs wings that blew Emily‚Äôs hair in her face.

I blinked and shook my head.
 ‚ÄúJazell!

 Emily was running over with Jason on her heels.
 She slowed down and hugged me tight.
 Jason slapped Seth on the back and bent over to catch his breath.
 ‚ÄúHey, where were you guys?‚Äù I asked.
 ‚ÄúWe were looking around to see if it was safe,‚Äù Emily said.
 ‚ÄúWe thought you two were doing the same.‚Äù She put her hands on her hips.

She was too busy to look up at Rodregas, but he almost smiled.
 He had no idea what she was trying to do, but at least they had something to try.
 He needed to keep Van‚Äôdret busy to give Imeralda time to do whatever magic she was going to cast.
 Rodregas turned to Van‚Äôdret and said, ‚ÄúWell, since you are killing us today, how about we make things interesting for both sides?
 I will answer a question of yours every time that you answer one of mine.‚Äù Van‚Äôdret expression darkened and he almost hissed his outrage, ‚ÄúYou would bargain with me, with your life held by a string?‚Äù For some strange reason that Rodregas was sure reflected a very deep character flaw, he felt his face break out in a very large toothy grin as he said, ‚ÄúAnd I have what to lose?‚Äù Van‚Äôdret stared at him for several long minutes before he shrugged and said, ‚ÄúVery well, ask me your question, but then you will answer mine or you die.‚Äù Rodregas simply nodded.
 He had no lack of questions, but was not sure which to ask first.
 He decided going small first would cause a less violent reaction.
 Rodregas said, ‚ÄúHow did you find us down here?‚Äù Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs expression at the question was like he had asked why is the sky blue.
 He nearly sneered his answer, ‚ÄúThrough magic, of course, a simple tracking spell.‚Äù Van‚Äôdret did not go small, ‚ÄúAre you three responsible for the death of the Immortalist Sorcerer Ravenhurr?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes and no,‚Äù responded Rodregas.
 He almost left it at that, but decided to continue, ‚ÄúI killed Ravenhurr during the Ceremony of Ascension.

We watched through the slats in the closet door as he would open her dresser drawers and rummage through her belongings, including her undergarments, while looking around over his shoulder, still yelling her name.
 Eventually, he would leave and somehow mom would come up with the rent to keep a roof over our heads for another month.
 We were getting old enough to know that we were different than most families in many ways, but we always knew we had a loving mother.
 Thomas and I also knew that the only other consistent thing in our life was each other.
 We were very close in size and we were often mistaken as twins although I had blond hair and he had brown.
 We fought like all brothers did, but we had always shared a bedroom and we talked each other to sleep every night.
 I never remember my mother dating much, so I think she was careful not to introduce us to any suitor until it was more serious.
 She eventually met a man who she was serious about, Dino.
 He would sometimes bring food we were not accustomed to eating, like steak.
 I had no memory of any man ever giving us a gift or anything of the sort before, but occasionally he would bring us a trinket to our mother‚Äôs delight.

The singing giant led a few thousand folks in a hymn.
 ‚ÄúSoftly and tenderly Jesus is calling, calling oh sinner come home, come home, come home, ye who are weary come home‚Ä¶‚Äù I mumbled the surrender words I heard someone else say, and waited.
 Cliff had stayed beside me.
 I believe he mumbled too.
 I looked for the girl with auburn hair, and wondered if she had bolted, too proud or afraid to surrender.
 Then a kid tapped me on the shoulder.
 I tapped Cliff and we followed the kid.
 He looked about sixteen.
 His haircut might have come from a Marine base.
 He wore glasses and a smile I interpreted as phony.

This doesn't go higher than our airplane, does it?"
 Rick laughed.
 "No.
 But it isn't enclosed.
 Just close your eyes if you get scared."
 But she was fascinated, not scared.
 The cart made to resemble a bicycle took them through the air above a moonlit village, and she squeezed Rick's hand in delight rather than fear.
 She enjoyed it so much that they got back in line and rode again.
 But as much as she enjoyed the "E.T."

Too much had happened.
 Too much was wrong.
 My life had flipped, twisted into some strange reflection of itself, and I couldn‚Äôt reconcile the fragments.
 It caused me physical pain to think about Chevelle‚Äôs touch, about council, about what was happening, and I knew it was the bonds.
 When Grey walked out, my trance broke and I noticed Ruby by the front window, wearing an odd smile.
 I flushed and turned from her, rolling into a ball on my blankets, remembering no more than the feel of his skin on my neck, the quirk of his lips.
 I had to keep distracted, and there was nothing for it but the book.
 I wasn‚Äôt able to find much regarding humans in the study‚Äôs library.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just a friend.

 You should accept her invitation.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to.
 I‚Äôd rather be with you.‚Äù She smiled and leaned over to kiss his cheek, but she could no longer concentrate on her book.
 How could it be that a man she‚Äôd known only a week wanted to be with her all the time when she‚Äôd gone four or five days at a time without seeing the man to whom she was betrothed?
 Could it be that Davis‚Äô job was harder than Rick‚Äôs?
 No‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt just that Rick didn‚Äôt spend half the evening at his office.
 He‚Äôd even chosen to be with her rather than with a girl he‚Äôd known longer than he had her, a girl from his own decade.
 Confusing thoughts and feelings kept her from being able to fall asleep quickly that night.
 She'd had so much fun this week, watching pictures and using the microwave oven and wearing blue jeans, but she missed her parents and her brother and Tom and Davis.

Rachel would always just get mad and say there was no excuse for how Jess was acting.
 Dominic always refused to say anything other than that Jessica had been through her own set of struggles, and had her reasons for her behavior.
 "I'll be done with Dom in just a moment, Jess, then I'll fix your hair while Rachel finishes up with Adri."
 The nickname should have hurt, but somehow it wasn't as bad when the pack used it.
 It was almost like having a new family, one without all of the grief-poisoned memories that popped up every time I really thought about Dad or Cindi.
 Faster than I would've believed possible, we were all in our dresses, and waiting in the living room for the boys to make their appearance.
 Jasmin and Rachel had worked what I was pretty sure was actual magic.
 Even Jessica was nothing less than stunning, and I didn't look as bad as normal.
 Jasmin's backless black dress and shoulder-length gloves had streaks of blue that brought out her eyes, while Dominic's tight, red gown seemed to give her the confidence and poise you'd expect from someone so gorgeous and utterly exotic.
 Jess had opted for a sleeveless silver number that flared out at the bottom so much I wasn't sure how Isaac would be able to walk next to her without stepping on the shimmery material.

 He would have loved to answer all her questions, but he knew she'd be embarrassed.
 She shook her head, still unable to understand how having her finger in his mouth could make her entire body throb and burn.
 Needing to push the feeling away, she rose and started to clear the table.
 "Don't."
 Rick took the dishes from her.
 "We're not going to spend our last hours together doing dishes."
 She swallowed, running her hands over his t-shirt.

 The Great Lion did not understand the Goddess‚Äô questions or concerns.
 But he understood his own power, which in its way was as great as any god‚Äôs.
 He growled, ‚ÄúDo you wish me to hunt, to fight?

‚ÄúThis is a good place to stop for the night,‚Äù Chevelle said, breaking my trance.
 I‚Äôd barely noticed the day pass.
 A glance at the path behind us showed the lake far in the distance below.
 It shook me from my stupor.
 I climbed down from my horse to stretch my legs over the trunk of a fallen tree, facing the mountain top instead of the view below, some part of me unable to accept the distance and height we had traveled.
 Chevelle led the horses to a thickset tree, its limbs stretching low and wide above the rocks.
 His hand spun to form a trough from the bark and tinder scattered beneath, the horses drinking as he used the same method to gather grasses from the sparse patches on the incline.
 Movement up the mountain caught my eye and I looked to Chevelle in alarm.
 Though he appeared calm, he was staring in the same direction.
 A dark cloaked figure advanced in the dusk, the full cape covering every part of its owner, drawn hood shielding their face.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù she asked as tears formed in her eyes.

 It seemed all the forest paused, listening for the answer.
 ‚ÄúHarruq, I love you.

 She stood on her toes and gave him a quick, soft kiss on his lips.
 A tear ran down Harruq‚Äôs cheek as he stood in shock.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs probably not here.
 He just sent me out here to look stupid yelling at trees.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúAnd what elf would that be?‚Äù asked a familiar voice from behind.
 Harruq whirled, his heart jumping as Aurelia stepped out from behind a tree.
 To his eyes, she was even more beautiful in the streaming daylight.
 Long auburn hair trailed past her shoulders, curled, and ended in several thin braids.
 Her face and eyes were small, the curve of her bones soft and elegant.
 She had small lips locked in a frown as she stood cross-armed, as if waiting on him.
 Her ears, upturned at the peak, were tiny even for her race.

 She shook her head with a youthful smile.
 "Such a good boy."
 Rachel, tears coursing down her face, stormed off as Alec pulled his mother's door shut behind us.
 I started to follow her, but Alec recaptured my hand in his.
 "She just needs a little time.
 Donovan will alert Jasmin."
 My surprise must have bled through to my face.
 Alec's smile had a tinge of sadness to it as he led me away.

The walls were stark white, like carved marble, and the room felt cold and empty, despite the abundance inside.
 I found a shelf to hide behind and placed my pilfered documents on the floor.
 I examined the shelves in front of me, looking for a match to the symbols, and found the sections to be arranged by groups, each shelf divided by categories within.
 I walked the library in search of the section marked for either of the characters listed on my documents, and was about to give up when I noticed some encased racks in the center of the room.
 I checked the small section, seeing immediately the symbols fit.
 I smiled, thinking how easy it had been as I slid my fingertips across the volumes on that shelf.
 My fingers tingled as they crossed a thin section of pages bound together.
 I slid them out just as I became aware of some sort of commotion‚Ä¶ that sounded like it was getting closer.
 No, not a tingle indicating what I was looking for.
 It was a protection spell.

 The other half-orc tightened the grip on his whip.

I'd thought my heart couldn't race any faster than it already was, but when he started moving his face down closer to mine, it felt like it was going to tear itself free from my chest.
 It was happening.
 I'd fantasized about kissing even back when I thought boys had cooties.
 I wasn't sure I was any more ready than I'd been out in the parking lot, but I could tell by the way he was moving that he wasn't going to abort this time.
 The tingling was even more intense now as I brought my hand up and cupped the side of his face, and then our lips met.
 It wasn't like I'd imagined.
 His lips were warm, and they had the slightest hint of softness, but there was more urgency and fierceness to the kiss than expected.
 It wasn't as amazing as I'd fantasized, but I was still having a hard time thinking.
 I tried to pull back and catch my breath, but his arms had become steel cables that pulled me in tighter.
 Fear finally overcoming my desire not to look stupid.

I wasn‚Äôt aware the room had grown silent until I wiped her ears and heard my own gasp.
 They were slightly rounded at the tips‚Ä¶ almost blunt.
 I realized I had stopped breathing as I read, so engrossed in the story.
 I reached up absentmindedly to stroke the tops of my ears.
 I looked up then, at the elders who surrounded me.
 Their faces were astonished.
 ‚ÄúShe is‚Ä¶ human,‚Äù they said.
 I took a steadying breath and spat out, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù They stared at me, incredulous.

Emily raised her arms and the ground shook under a faery.
 Roots twisted upward and wrapped around one of the five faery men that were left.
 The other four fell dead from my arrows and Jason's knives.
 I ran out from behind the tree and stormed over to the squirming faery man.
 Or I should to call them faery jerks now.
 I grabbed his coat and forced him to look at me.
 He smirked and I couldn't hold back the urge to slap him.
 I slapped my hand across his face so hard it left a mark on his cheek.

I got more than friendly with Gloria Valenciana, who was down from Los Angeles camping with her family.
 Her dad made her turn in early.
 When I joined Eric at our campfire, I asked him why he didn‚Äôt seem interested in girls.
 ‚ÄúHalf of my friends are girls,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúYou know what I mean.
 Don‚Äôt you get horny?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúOnly, for me, it‚Äôs too soon.
 I‚Äôve got a bunch more to learn.‚Äù The last couple months of that summer, while I smashed golf balls, played baseball in Mexico on Sundays, and visited my cousins in Pacific Beach, Eric ran around with Margaret Beasley, Pam Greenman, and Lane Campbell.

At least that's what they said, and I tend to believe them."
 Alec crossed over to me and ran a finger down the side of my face.
 "Only you could manage to make a joke out of having fallen in with monsters."
 I shrugged.
 "What else is a girl to do?"
 Alec's reply shrug mirrored mine exactly and yet still turned the movement into something far more graceful and eloquent than what I'd managed.
 "Be that as it may, I think you don't give yourself enough credit for just how amazing you are."
 I felt myself start to blush as Alec disappeared into the bathroom.
 ** Monsters I could handle, motorcycles were something else entirely.
 I'd almost backed out when Alec told me we'd be taking his bullet bike, but I didn't want him to know I really was a complete wuss.

And I couldn‚Äôt help but imagine.
 He was unmagical.
 He had no idea what I could do to him, for him, in such an intimate setting.
 What could it hurt, really?
 Sure, I could marry him, but it wouldn‚Äôt be real, I knew that.
 But the other part, well, I could do that without the marriage, couldn‚Äôt I?
 Harmless fun‚Ä¶ I smiled as I leaned closer to him.
 This was the first time I had initiated a kiss and he was grateful‚Äîmore than grateful‚Ä¶ overwhelmed with pleasure.
 I laughed to myself at what was to come, if this small, insignificant gesture brought him so much happiness.
 Our lips touched and he gasped, and then the breath turned to a low moan.

Yet, during this same period total employment in America has expanded phenomenally, from a mere 13 million workers in 1870 to 68 million in 1955 and more than 136 million in 2002.
 In spite of all the automation and all the export of jobs to lower wage economies, the percentage of the American population employed has continued to rise over time.
 Several factors are responsible for this result, among which population growth and technological development are most prominent.
 Rising levels of technological sophistication certainly displace workers in most fields of manufacturing.
 But at the same time they stimulate growth of employment in many different ways ‚Äì increasing demand for the products thus manufactured by a factor of 10, 100 or even 1000 fold as in the case of automobiles, TVs, cell phones and computers; increasing the demand for research workers to support technological innovation and for teachers to meet the rising demand for education; and rising living standards, which increases consumption of other goods and services due to the falling prices made possible by rising productivity.
 Over the past two decades the US economy lost nearly 4 million manufacturing jobs but added a net 37 million jobs through expansion of the service sector, which now accounts for 84 per cent of total employment.
 It is time that we stop resisting or resenting this trend, but rather strive to adapt by shifting our focus toward those fields of employment which are most directly stimulated by technological innovation.
 Export of commercial services already accounts for 20 per cent of world trade.
 The shift from manufacturing to services is a positive and inevitable expression of the elevation of human activity from the physical to the mental level, which is the central reason for the phenomenal rise in global living standards over the past century.
 Rich nations have become rich through a shift of workers from the primary farm sector to value-added, non-farm secondary and tertiary sectors.

the area of agriculture has seen a shift away from the92m traditional0m conditions of fisheries to the development92m of0m various92m farming0m strategies. The new sector is primarily global agriculture, with an92m emphasis0m on the utilization of natural92m resources0m.<eop> Workers in this new world of private enterprise are more actively involved in winning new orders and pyramid

They must appear black in the shadows.
 The thought made me flush.
 I was staring into someone‚Äôs eyes.
 But as quickly as I had come upon him, he was gone.
 He turned from me without a word and disappeared in a few long strides.
 I watched him go.
 Short dark hair, dark eyes, and a large, strong build.
 He certainly wasn‚Äôt from this clan.

You appeared to be an Immortalist Sorcerer and I have grown to hate the Immortalists.
 When it became clear that you were not, I stopped trying to kill you.‚Äù He paused at this, and then Rodregas could tell he made a decision.
 ‚ÄúYou have given me a sword, if a small one, and among my people that is a powerful gesture.
 I will not lie to you, I have left my old life behind and the last few years I have learned to truly hate the Immortalists.
 I travel with you only because the others were going to go back to their homes, and I have no home to go back to,‚Äù he seemed to finish, but then added, ‚ÄúLast night you pointed out that the forces of the Immortalists would be after you and you would fight them.
 And you also proved that you can fight.‚Äù Once again he paused.
 He was clearly a man that liked to think before he spoke.
 ‚ÄúI am simply using you as bait.
 When they come for you, I will kill them.
 Fighting together we will kill some of their vaulted Immortal Guards.‚Äù As Doi‚Äôvan finished he gave a low growl and shook his horned head, his thick mane of wild jet black hair was almost as distinctive as Imeralda‚Äôs own auburn flowing locks.

It was accompanied by sharpness of sound as well.
 My ears were in excruciating pain.
 The horse dropped, his head smacked to the ground and I watched through his eyes as he hit.
 The animal‚Äôs senses stilled, not panicked as my own.
 I didn‚Äôt understand what was happening, couldn‚Äôt quite form a thought.
 I yearned to retreat into the horse, run from the agony, but the severity of it tore me back and kept me there in my own head.
 It felt and sounded like metal bands inside my mind, inside my ears, screeching.
 I hadn‚Äôt opened my eyes again and now I couldn‚Äôt.
 I couldn‚Äôt find my body; I wanted to bring my hands to my head, cover my ears.
 But I couldn‚Äôt feel anything aside from the pain in my mind.

He closed the distance between himself and Alec with such quickness that for a second I thought they were going to fight then and there.
 For the first time I realized just how much bigger Brandon was than Alec.
 I'd never seen them so close together.
 They were so careful not to cross paths, it was possible this was a true first, but seeing them now there was no way to get around the fact that Brandon was at least two inches taller, as well as being broader and more muscular.
 I'd seen Alec shirtless, and he had the incredible physique of a swimsuit model, but Brandon's was that of a professional body builder.
 Either of them dwarfed me, but Brandon gave off an air of menace that even Alec's controlled power couldn't offset.
 Brandon's next few words came out in a low growl that I couldn't make out, and then he slowly backed away from Alec before he and the rest of his pack disappeared from sight.
 I finished processing everything about the time Alec turned and walked back.
 I opened my mouth to protest, but he shook his head at me as we all fell into formation around him.
 From what little I knew about Alec's pack, it wasn't uncommon for them to spend time together without the kind of chest-beating byplay that was so much a part of Brandon's group, but our lunch table was even more subdued than I'd expected.

He spoke candidly about how he needed to forget his old acquaintances and of starting a new life away from the influences that once nearly destroyed him.
 At the end of his speech, he held his ‚Äúgraduation‚Äù plaque proudly in the air to a loud applause.
 Our son was last to walk up to the front.
 As he stood up, we all held hands in anticipation of his speech.
 He looked each of us in the eyes as he fought tears.
 He apologized for the damage his addiction had caused.
 He looked at his mother and me and apologized for more than I can list.
 He repeated many of the apologies‚Äô that he had confessed during his many candid phone calls.

"No," she replied, intrigued.
 "What is it?"
 "It's like ice cream but better for you.

 She couldn't make up her mind between chocolate-covered cherry and chocolate almond, so he asked for a sample of each.
 When she at last chose the former, he ordered a waffle cone of it for her--inspired to have M & Ms added at the last minute--and a cone of pecan praline for himself.

Once the guard committed, Rodregas brought both of his swords down and met the lunging blade.
 Rodregas could not meet his sword edge to edge, but it was thrusting out and he caught it and pushed it down and to the left.
 At the same time he moved his body to the side and in close.
 Rodregas then dropped his right sword as he kept his left engaged, pushing the blue steel sword away.
 Rodregas moved in and thrust out with his open hand with a speed the guard simply could not match nor have expected.
 Rodregas had the guard‚Äôs throat in his grasp before his opponent knew what was happening.
 The guard was not a big man and with his celestial strength Rodregas simply picked him up and squeezed.
 Rodregas felt the guard‚Äôs neck give under his grip.
 Before the slavers could react, Rodregas went from lifting him up to driving him down into the ground.
 Adrenaline was surging and suddenly Rodregas had a bloody mess in his hand.

Though the two fanciest robes both heavily embroidered and of Western Silk, also went to the bed.
 Next, he went to the trunk which was made of High Cedar wood and which matched the large wardrobe, but was much more portable.
 Unfortunately, the only items of use in it were several blankets of good quality wool.
 The remaining contents consisted of drawings, pictures and other personal items.
 Rodregas dumped the trunk contents on the floor, sandwiched the armor in the blankets and loaded up the trunk.
 How he was going to cart the trunk out of the tower he did not yet know.
 He went to the door and listened; it seemed to be getting quieter.
 It was the middle of the night and the stir from the ceremony seemed to have subsided, but it was only hours until dawn when everyone would be heading out to celebrate the new ‚Äòbirth‚Äô of Ravenhurr.

In 1993 alone, consumer prices rose by more than 100 per cent in 15 countries, out of which 11 former republics of the USSR reported increases of more than 300 per cent.
 This was accompanied by a sharp rise in unemployment from extremely low historical levels prior to 1989 up to an average of 17 per cent in 1994.
 The tremendous physical and psychological stress experienced by people in the region as a result of the economic collapse is reflected in the sharp fall in birth rates and the steep rise in death rates.
 Since 1989, the birth rate has fallen by more than 20 per cent in Poland, 25 per cent in Bulgaria, 30 per cent in Estonia and Romania, 35 per cent in Russia and more than 60 per cent in Eastern Germany.
 Such abrupt changes have been observed previously in industrial societies only during times of war.
 Infant mortality is rising in many of the countries.
 Not surprisingly, there have been increasing indications of public discontent and voter dissatisfaction with the course of the reforms in the vast majority of countries.
 Simultaneous Shocks
 The collapse of the East European and Central Asian economies from 1990 to 1994 resulted from their exposure to a series of simultaneous shocks.
 1.Stabilization and adjustments: The majority of countries, having suffered from inflation and balance of payments problems in the 1980s, applied sharp stabilization and adjustment programmes in the early 1990s to stop inflation, balance budgets, and close balance of payments gaps, while at the same time liberalizing prices in order to correct major price distortions.

I was going to walk, and that was it.
 Maybe if I passed out on the side of the road and ended up in the hospital Britney would finally realize what a wench she was.
 I was barely out of sight of the school, still vividly imagining Alec and Britney's faces when they found out that they'd put me in the hospital, when I heard a car approaching from behind me.
 Only it wasn't zipping by, it was slowing down.
 Every scary story I'd ever heard about rapists, kidnappers and murderers suddenly flowed through my mind like frayed ropes catching at my insides as they went, pulling out all of the other thoughts and feelings until there was nothing left but a hollow, fear-filled shell.
 I found myself praying for the first time since the accident, pleading with whatever might be out there listening to protect me and get me safely home.
 My heart was pounding so hard it almost drowned out the crunch of gravel as the car pulled even with me.
 I didn't recognize the vehicle, which was a bad sign.
 It was a light-eating black, and emitted the throaty roar of a sports car.
 The windows were tinted; I could see that much out of the corner of my eye without acknowledging that it was there.

I hadn't anticipated that every other student was going to spend the class carefully ignoring me.
 I'd never really fit in, but this was unbelievable.
 New students could always count on someone to offer to be their friends.
 I'd seen it a dozen times before as people had moved in.
 The really attractive people got drawn into the popular circles, less cool people were offered a place with the punks, the nerds, or at least with the drug users, who didn't care as much what you looked or acted like as long as you were hooked on something illegal.
 I knew I had serious problems, but I didn't think they were obvious to everyone that looked at me.
 English was next, and odds were it would be a nearly exact repeat of Biology, possibly minus the awkward introduction.
 The thin, distinguished looking teacher absently accepted my proffered form, starting a little when I didn't leave.

 I opened my eyes to find I was sitting on the ground next to my sleeping body.
 I saw Emily sitting there, saying nothing for once.
 Something fell off my back and I picked it up.
 It was a wooden bow, and when I reached behind my back I felt a quiver full of feathered arrows strapped there.
 I ran a finger over the smooth, dark wood and turned to see Seth crashing out of the woods.
 I smirked at him and pointed at his head.
 ‚ÄúYou have dark blue hair.‚Äù I giggled, not knowing why I was giggling after what had just happened to us a few minutes ago.
 He frowned and pulled a piece or two out of his head.

He planted his foot under his body.
 His attackers seemed confused, grabbing him and trying to counter his change of position.
 Rodregas only had one leg under him, but he pushed off with it with all his strength and thrust himself up.
 It should have failed with all the men holding him down, but he now had celestial strength, and even with the knife wound he was strong.
 His attackers backed off, confused by the fact that he had gone from being their prisoner to suddenly rising.
 The person pinning Rodregas‚Äô left arm got too far away.
 This gave Rodregas the leverage he needed to pull the arm free.
 He punched his assailant hard in the face.
 The attacker flew back and Rodregas jumped sideways to get more space.
 Rodregas rested his right hand on the knife blade still sticking out of his stomach.

‚ÄúThey sent you to find me?‚Äù Her bright blue eyes flicked to Chevelle and back.
 ‚ÄúNo, Freya.
 They will not know I saw you.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey are looking for me?‚Äù Terror crept into my voice.
 I was Chevelle‚Äôs captive, but he‚Äôd given me some sort of reprieve.
 The thought of council brought the danger of my situation to the forefront.
 ‚ÄúNo.
 They will not risk it.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey are afraid,‚Äù Chevelle said from his spot by the fire.
 Junnie shot him a warning glance.
 ‚ÄúAfraid?‚Äù I asked, doubtful.

It lasted about a year.
 She was there when we recorded some of our first songs, I remember that.
 She loved, uh, ‚ÄúHayley Mill‚Äôs Underpants.‚Äù  For some reason, she thought that was her song.
 Maybe because Carol was a young woman who loved lingerie.
 And, as a young man, who appreciated a young woman who loved lingerie, well, we had some fiery times.
 Hot as monkeys.

‚ÄúI can build one easily.‚Äù ‚ÄúSweet, but when do we do it?
 All four of us hang out every day.‚Äù ‚ÄúI can solve that problem.
 We just tell them we want a day to do girl things and they‚Äôll butt right out,‚Äù she slid onto the floor and snatched a strawberry.
 I grinned, ‚ÄúThis is going to be some fun revenge!‚Äù ‚ÄúYou can say that again.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúthis is going to be some fun revenge.‚Äù She wacked me in the head with my pillow, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so weird.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs the way I am, deal with it,‚Äù I wacked her back with my own pillow.
 ‚ÄúNo I will not deal with it,‚Äù she walloped me in the head one more time.
 ‚ÄúI need you for team penguin, and I don‚Äôt need a smarty pants.‚Äù ‚ÄúHow come you get to name the team?‚Äù I asked.
 ‚ÄúBecause I was the one who got shot first.‚Äù Early the next day, which wasn‚Äôt that early because we got up around ten o‚Äôclock, we gathered my old water gun and some water balloons.
 Emily brought down the trebuchet she‚Äôd spent all night building and we took off on our bikes.
 Emily led the way to Jason‚Äôs where she was pretty sure the boys would be.
 We hid our bikes in the trees and snuck up to their backyard.

She told them she needed to leave.
 At first they didn‚Äôt believe her.
 Then they cried.
 By now, she had been gone three years.
 Over that time, she attended several churches and felt compelled to tell her story, since God wants his people to share our burdens with one another.
 At two churches she was informally but firmly shunned.
 The third church she was asked to leave.
 Though she didn‚Äôt explain, I suppose her expulsion resulted from her theory about evil being inside us all or from the fear she would infect the congregation with notions that could lead to an epidemic of broken marriages.
 At the end of her story, Curly comes over and gives her friend some reasons they need to move along.
 Before they leave, Curly reaches down and rubs my shoulder.

Before climbing into Richard‚Äôs car, Sylvia commanded me, ‚ÄúIf you brought any liquor, Kenneth, go away.‚Äù I agreed and waited until they drove off before scooping a pint of bourbon and a bottle of ginger ale out of my Chevrolet‚Äôs trunk.
 I wanted to get numb.
 For about the tenth time, Karen Flagstad had rejected me, even though a few days before I had warned her that if she wouldn‚Äôt join me at a movie that weekend, I would fast until death.
 From breakfast Monday until late Wednesday afternoon, all I had ingested were three beers and a Coke.
 Then I gobbled two jumbo hamburgers and spent the night consuming aspirins, with my head on two pillows because one alone felt hard as pavement.
 The next day, after Spanish class on Friday, I recounted my ordeal to Karen and explained that all my suffering certainly must have earned me her company at the movies.
 She congenially disagreed.
 While Eric and I drank bourbon and ginger ale, I griped about Karen.
 At first I acted tough and unruffled, but soon the bourbon took hold, and I confessed the pain in my gut that had nothing to do with fasting.
 He asked why I got so obsessed about Karen, knowing I never had pursued anybody else so boldly.

Qurrah stepped back from his brother, and Aurelia noticed his robes and frowned.
 ‚ÄúYou should have left them.

 For a moment all three glanced about, the atmosphere akin to air before a thunderstorm.
 Qurrah broke the silence.

It was like someone else was doing the talking for me.
 I'd never been this bold, and to do so now with someone who could arrange for my mom's job to disappear again seemed like the worst kind of stupidity, but I couldn't fall apart now.
 I almost couldn't believe my eyes when his face turned red.
 "Listen here, Missy.
 I've been in politics longer than you've been alive, and it takes a whole hell of a lot more than a precocious teenager to blackmail me.
 So, you can just drop your veiled threats and pretend like we never had this conversation, or I¬†will¬†see that your mom is once again unemployed, and we'll just see whether or not your protector is bluffing."
 Stepping out of my front door and being hit by a cement truck would have been less of a surprise.
 I'd thought something odd was happening, but the idea of someone protecting us was almost unbelievable.
 The mayor took my shock as a sign he once again had the upper hand.

New indices, such as the Sustain able Livelihood Security Index now under development in India, need to be evolved and applied; they should combine measures of income and employment; food and nutritional status, including the availability of safe drinking water and sanitation facilities; ownership of productive assets; and education and productive skills.
 The pace of human development continues to accelerate.
 The world has changed more during the present century than in the previous nineteen centuries combined ‚Äì economically, socially, politically, scientifically and technologically.
 In recent decades humankind has been buffeted by a bewildering array and intensity of transforming powers ‚Äì democratization, decolonization, demilitarization, globalization, universal education, scientific advances, information, successive technological revolutions brought about by the automobile, telephone, radio, television, jet aircraft, computers, satellite communications and genetic engineering.
 Coping with such rapid change has not been easy.
 It has brought in its wake a broad array of problems ‚Äì a widening gap between the most advanced and least developed sections both within and between nations, a disequilibrium between growth of population and economic growth, rising unemployment, alienated youth, increasing violence and crime, depletion of natural resources, degradation of the environment, overcrowded cities, mass migrations of talent from South to North, displacement of millions of political and economic refugees, the breakdown of the family and the erosion of traditional social institutions.
 Although much has been learned about the various stages of social and economic development, much less is known about the actual process itself by which societies transit from one stage or level or form to another.
 As a result, our efforts to speed the transition are often haphazard, stumbling and fraught with difficulty.
 Today former colonial nations such as Vietnam and Zimbabwe strive to catch up with countries that have never been subject to foreign rule.
 The tribal nations of central Africa struggle at great cost to transform themselves into modern states.

Rick let the embrace go on for as long as he could.
 Then he ended it abruptly, setting her on the sofa and holding himself away from her.
 "Rick," she gasped, reaching for him.
 "No.
 No, no, no," he groaned, refusing to let her put her arms around him or kiss him.
 "I want more, Rick.
 Please kiss me again."
 His groan was deeper this time, and he turned away from her, dropping his head into his hands.
 "Please go to bed, Marie."
 "But Rick--" "Just go to bed.

By the time we made it to the lunch room, I was heartily sick of dodging jocks with shoulders the size of an ox.
 Why on earth did every single one of them think it was necessary to mock fight, throw balls back and forth to each other, or otherwise make a spectacle of themselves?
 My mood was further soured as we arrived to find an unmistakable circle of bystanders signaling an impending fight.
 My first instinct was to go find a teacher before the two idiots hurt each other, but while I was still looking around to see if there was an adult in the room, Britney grabbed my arm and pulled me towards the circle.
 It wasn't until we got closer that I realized there was something wrong with the circle of kids surrounding the combatants.
 Normally everyone pressed in tight for the best possible view.
 The spectators in this fight were divided into two groups, with a fairly significant space between them.
 The rest of the students seemed to be reluctant to fill that gap in.
 It wasn't until Britney pulled me closer that I understood why.
 Brandon stood surrounded by his friends on one side of the circle, with Alec and a smaller group standing opposite them.

"It's not crazy.
 Everyone who swaps classes is going to be doing double homework for the duration.
 Assignments for their old class, which they presumably still want to get credit for, and assignments for the new class so as not to make any more waves than necessary with their temporary teacher.
 It only makes sense to place that burden on the ones who can most easily deal with it."
 That last part had been said in a near whisper, due to the fact that we were right outside Mrs. Sorenson's class.
 Everything he was saying made sense, but didn't resolve the real reason I was so worried.
 "I can help.
 I could switch at least one class and still keep up."
 Alec shook his head.

"Mallory, I'd like to introduce you to Adriana Paige.
 Adriana, Mallory."
 I smiled, and gingerly offered my hand to her, which she clasped in both of hers.
 "I'm very happy to finally get to meet you, young lady.
 Alec is better company than most, but it's nice to have a new face around here."
 I felt myself warming to her immediately, even more so as she ushered us into her small sitting room and clucked over me, all the while proclaiming that I was far too skinny.
 It was exactly the kind of thing you'd expect your grandma to say, but I almost believed her.
 Alec helped both of us down into our chairs, and then smiled as Mallory waved him off.
 "You go ahead and do your chores.
 We girls will just get to know each other, and then once you're done, you can bring me up to speed on the latest developments."

I'd had enough pity from my mom to last years.
 "You bet.
 Think they bought it?"
 I tried to inject the proper amount of blonde stupidity into my words, but wasn't sure it worked until I felt Alec's arms tighten almost painfully around me.
 I gasped, and he set me down so quickly I almost fell over.
 Before I'd even regained my balance, he was walking away, moving so quickly I would've needed to run to keep up.
 Even so, he hadn't turned away quick enough to hide the complete disdain in his expression.
 I suddenly found myself wishing I'd told him the truth rather than making him think I was stupid and manipulative.
 It was too late.
 He was already out of sight, and by now his opinion of me was fixed.

"Not really.

 "It looks like we'd better be going or we'll both be late."
 Les Mis√©rables.
 I managed to put the impending drawing more or less out of my mind for the first half of the day, but I actually missed Britney's constant gossip.
 There was almost no redeeming value to most of what she said, but it did have the benefit of being distracting.
 By the time lunch finally came around I needed some kind of distraction.
