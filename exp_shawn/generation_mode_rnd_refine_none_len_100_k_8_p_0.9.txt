He said that last with his heart stopping blue eyes gazing directly into mine and I nearly stopped breathing.
 Somehow he hadn't realized yet that when he looked at me like that there wasn't anything I could deny him.
 "Ok, you can get me a present, something small and relatively inexpensive."
 Alec smiled and reached over to the backpack as he sat up.
 I let him pull me up and then felt my face freeze as he pulled out one of the largest velvet boxes I'd ever seen.
 "Alec, no."
 "It wasn't that expensive and you've already told me I could."
 "I didn't think you'd have something already ready and waiting to ambush me with.
 I thought I'd at least have a few days to prepare myself."
 He smiled again and I gingerly held my hand out.

“Yes,” Ahrqur whispered, grimacing as if filled with horrid pain.
 “When she approached me, I offered no resistance.
 Now will you let me return to peace?”
 “Not yet.
 Harruq, would you like to tell him?”
 Ahrqur glanced at Harruq, who was grinning wide.
 “You can see we have orcish blood in us, right?” Harruq asked.
 “Aye, you stink of it,” the spirit said.
 “Well, we also have elven blood in us.
 Our mum said she bedded an elf before she was thrown out of town.

It was too small to be Doi’van and Rodregas staggered over reaching for him, determined to take one final slaver with him.
 His wounded leg buckled again, and Rodregas tried to reach for the ground to slow his fall, but something was wrong with his arm and it did not move.
 For a split second he saw the ground coming up to hit him in the face.
 And then... darkness.
 CHAPTER 10 THE OTHER KIND OF PAIN
 Rodregas laid there looking at blue swirls for a long time, wondering where he was.
 He was not sure if he was awake; his mind seemed heavy with dreams, and shifting images.
 It took him a long time before he remembered the battle.
 With the memory came concern for Doi’van and Imeralda, and a surge of adrenaline that gave him the energy to try to wake up.
 Rodregas tried to sit up, but his body, which had been so strong since that day at Raven Keep, now only responded sluggishly.

Mrs. Tiggs was positively glowing as we all walked into her classroom.
 She popped out of her chair as soon as the bell rang, and began handing out graded tests.
 My world started trembling as I turned my test over and saw an 'F' at the top of the page.
 'Come see me after class.'
 The note felt like the final nail in the coffin of my academic future.
 My efforts to focus were entirely wasted.
 It took everything I had just to hold myself together until class ended.
 I'd planned on remaining in my seat until everyone else left, but Mrs. Tiggs motioned me to her desk while half the class was still filing out the door.
 "It gives me no pleasure to tell you this, but based on your initial test score I think you should prepare yourself for the fact that you're probably going to fail this class.
 I worried this would be the result of your starting so late in the semester and not having any prior Spanish experience.

But even in consort, they don’t explain why we ought to do good or why we should avoid sin.
 We could infer we should do it because God said so, but to some of us, that answer feels unworthy.
 Pastor Ed Noble suggested an answer that rings more complete.
 The word translated "the right thing" or “the good” or what we “ought to do” is the Greek kalos in the accusative case, more naturally translated as "beautiful".
 So what we ought to seek is "the beautiful" or "to do the beautiful".
 One reason I would rather seek the beautiful than the good is because I can know with more confidence when I have encountered it.
 When I first read the John Keats poem, “Ode on a Grecian Urn” I got both enthralled and challenged by the lines “Beauty is truth, truth beauty.
 That is all we know on earth and all we need to know.” I believe those words are inspired, expressing deep though mysterious wisdom.
 Bible translators may avoid the word "beauty" because too many readers might interpret in ways akin to the ’60s motto, “If it feels good, do it.” In my vocabulary, "beautiful" describes a harmony that suggests the eternal.
 Such beauty may harbor sadness, or even a terrifying dread.

CM:  	Anything else you want to say about that song?
 BG:  	Uh, just that the line “It’s raining in my heart” is, of course, an homage to Buddy.
 And the line “It’s raining Grabenhorst” is about an old school friend.
 CM:  	We’ve already discussed her, I believe.
 BG: 	Did we?
 Good.
 It’s got that “Green River” riff to it, a chugging thing, even though it’s acoustic, it sounds like a freight train, don’t you think?
 CM:  	Ok, uh, “If You Push Your Belly Button your Legs Fall Off.”  Many critics said this was like a children’s song.
 Like “Mary Had a Little Lamb.” Consciously so?
 BG:  	A children’s song?

In other words, we enter heaven in all its beauty.
 Beauty
 James 4: 17 in the King James declares, “Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.” The New International Version reads “Anyone, then, who knows the good he ought to do and doesn’t do it, sins."
 The New American Standard’s version is, “Therefore, to one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it, to him it is sin.” Put these translations together, they insist that to do good is the right thing and what we ought to do.
 But even in consort, they don’t explain why we ought to do good or why we should avoid sin.
 We could infer we should do it because God said so, but to some of us, that answer feels unworthy.
 Pastor Ed Noble suggested an answer that rings more complete.

Chapter Sixteen Lessons
 The dreams I had then were the most dreadful I’d ever had.
 I jolted awake and shuddered for several minutes at the images I could not beat down.
 Ruby was there, waiting for me.
 “Where are the others?” I asked, voice hoarse.
 “They’ve set up a perimeter.” It was all I had to say for the moment.
 I felt empty, alone.
 It was dark; even with the dust I’d not slept through the night.
 I sat up, curling my legs against my chest, and wrapped my arms around them, pulling tightly in.
 Though I didn’t speak, I occasionally glanced, or glared, at Ruby.

 One after another the deft strokes came in, and one after another Antonil batted them away using the methodical style that had helped him rise to his place at the top of the Neldaren army.
 His opponent, a young elf whose swordplay was raw compared to most of his brethren, tried to give him no reprieve.
 The guard captain didn’t falter in the slightest.
 “You sacrifice planning and thought for sheer speed and reflexes,” he said, his breathing steady and practiced.
 He assumed the elf spoke the human tongue, and the sudden killing lunge proved him correct.
 Antonil pulled his head back, the point stopping just shy of drawing blood.
 An upward cut took the blade from the elf’s hand.
 Antonil’s sword looped around, thrust forward, and buried deep inside flesh.
 The elf fell, gasping for air from the fatal wound.

He dropped his swords.
 His hands closed about something soft.
 By the time his rage calmed, blood was on his hands and the remains of an elf lay in the dirt below the window.
 “Stupid elfie,” he said, gingerly touching the arrow in his neck.
 Not knowing what else to do, he closed his hand about the shaft and pulled.
 A minute later, still lying in agonizing pain, the half-orc managed to pry open one of his healing potions.
 He gulped the swirling blue-silver contents and then tossed the vial.
 Ripping the other arrow out of his side, he felt a warm, soothing sensation fill his body.
 “Are you alright?” he heard a raspy voice ask from atop the stairs.
 “Yeah, I’m fine.

A number of scientists--men who called themselves scientists, that is--have built different types of machines, but I don't think you and I could do that.
 They had no really provable success, anyway."
 She shook her head, turning a page.
 "I don't understand this at all.
 There's a man named Stephen Hawking--" "He's a very well-known scientist."
 "Then maybe what this article says could be helpful.
 But I can't understand it.
 It has all these strange words--wormholes, white dwarfs, odd things like that.
 I can't follow this at all."
 "Let me see it then."

The question caught me so much by surprise that the tiny ant I'd been watching managed to drag his heavy burden of leaves halfway across the nearest flagstone before I managed a response.
 "Is this because of earlier?
 Because I told you I don't expect you to stay with me?"
 Apparently it was his turn to spend some time pondering his reply.
 My six-legged friend was joined by another of his kind, and they were manfully working their way up the hill towards a tree.
 "I've actually wanted to ask you for quite a while.
 Hearing that Brandon was taking you was harder for me to accept than you might imagine.
 My asking you now has nothing to do with our conversation from earlier today."
 "Why are you doing it now then?
 I half expected you to try and send me out of the country again.

What happened?"
 Tears shimmered in her eyes.
 "I was miserable.
 I mean, I was really happy to see my family, and we felt closer than ever.
 They thought I'd been kidnapped at first, but when there was no ransom request, they were afraid I'd been murdered.
 They were out of their minds.
 When I walked back into our garden, I ran up to my parents' room.
 I thought my mother’s screams were going to bring the police.
 And then I spent the whole morning with them—it was wonderful.

Chapter 12
 The monsters surged up the hill, blocking out Kojas’ delirious laughter.
 Seth shouted, “Stay together, don’t get separated!” A troll charged at me and I jumped to the side.
 I looked up and saw that Emily, Jason, and Seth had been swallowed by the rushing creatures.
 So much for that plan.
 “Emily!” I yelled but my voice was drowned out.
 I saw a flash of fire off to the side.
 Emily was fine.
 I twisted around so that the troll charged past me.
 I turned and plunged my knife into its back before it could respond and it fell to the ground.

Of course.
 He was testing me, making sure I was going to keep quiet about what he'd done.
 Probably because he didn't want any of the praise for such a selfless act.
 I was usually a pretty lousy liar, but it isn't really a lie if you both know the truth.
 "Brandon, you can trust me.
 There isn't anything odd going on.
 At least nothing odder than normal for Sanctuary."
 Brandon looked at me for several seconds, and then chuckled.
 "You're right, compared to other places we do tend towards oddness.
 It's the small town effect, I think."

I'll bet she just got some really, really bad news."
 I felt a dull ache starting behind my eyes.
 "Just because I finished my Physics doesn't mean I don't have other stuff I need to do, and I don't even want to guess at what would make her go that white.
 I just hope whatever it was turns out not to be as bad as she thought it was."
 Britney rolled her eyes.
 "Please, like you don't have just as much reason to hate her as me.
 Besides, what other homework could you possibly have?
 You're like the most anal person I know when it comes to doing your homework.
 Therefore you finished it all last night, and have nothing that could possibly be more important than talking to me."
 Her logic sucked, but that didn't bother me even half as bad as how sure of herself she was.

Harruq shrugged.
 “I said it before.
 I’m here to protect you.”
 “Then kill those that seek to kill me,” Qurrah said, a bit of his sleepiness leaving him.
 “Our master has given us so much.
 Power.
 Weapons.
 A purpose.
 What more could we ever ask for?”
 “Yeah, what else,” Harruq said, shifting more of his brother’s weight onto his shoulder.

He watched as she rubbed lotion on her lovely legs, her silky dark hair falling forward as she did so.
 Marie, not noticing any difference in his stare, smiled as she handed him the bottle.
 "Will you put some on my back?"
 She stretched out on her stomach.
 He ran his hands up and down and around her back, massaging and caressing.
 Her skin was so soft.
 He dropped a kiss onto her shoulder.
 "Does that feel good?"
 "Mmm," she murmured sleepily.
 Moving her hair aside, he kissed the nape of her neck.

The call went better than expected as you could hear Steve coaching her in the background.
 Ashley fell nicely into all of the comments the police wanted to record.
 I was told by Officer White to tell her I could meet her in a couple of days as I was out of town.
 I told her I would call her when I returned and after work hours.
 She agreed and the call ended.
 At the time, I didn’t understand why we didn’t just go do the deal right away, but the cops needed to get a crew together and do all this planning for the bust.
 Once this part of the deal was confirmed, the officer left the room and returned with a stack of documents for me to sign.
 I didn’t read much of it because it didn’t really matter what it said.
 They were the documents that they needed to cover their asses, period!
 Two nervous days passed before I got the go-ahead and a time and location for the drug deal.

The night was still deep and the town quiet.
 Beside him, Harruq snored loud enough to wake the drunkest of men.
 Far away, a wolf howl beckoned.
 “Sleep well,” Qurrah said, leaving the town.
 His doubt faded with each step.
 All was identical to his dreams.
 A mile from town, he saw the hill, a smoldering fire atop it to guide his way.
 Waiting there was the dark man, his red eyes shining down on him as he approached.
 “Say the words,” the man in the black robe ordered.
 His voice was quiet but deep, a mixture of hate and malice compressed into audible form.

She fell on her back, still clutching her bleeding abdomen.
 That look of sadness tore through his rage.
 What should have been the exhilaration of the kill was instead the cold, biting emotion of guilt.
 His eyes lingered on the blood on his blade before something changed inside.
 He looked back to the elf, and again the words of his brother echoed in his head.
 Do you love her?
 No, he’d said.
 _Then kill her._
 “Aurelia?” he asked, as if seeing her for the first time.
 “I didn’t mean to, I, Aurry, please…”

 Introduction by Camel Jeremy Eros
 The veracity of the following has been called into question.
 That the people who would know, the people who were actually there, all three voices heard here, are all dead makes proving it somewhat difficult.
 Buddy Gardner died, famously, of a heroin/pill/alcohol overdose;   Lorelei Enos died only a few years ago by her own hand, after an incident, which was kept out of the papers because of the famous talk show host involved.
 And, Creole Myers, the interviewer, died just last year of cancer.

Doctor – (really into drawing on one of the papers on the clipboard and not really paying attention)  (speaks periodically throughout Character 1’s monologue without looking up) Zat is very interesting!
 Fascinating!
 Character 1- Well and then there was father…I never met him personally, but mother said that he was hard at work at his job of making license plates for the state, and from time to time she would point one out and say ‘kids, your father might have made that one’ or some other such thing, it wasn’t until I was sixteen that I found out that dad was in prison as a serial jay-walker and general public nuisance.
 (notices the doctors obsession with the drawing)  Um what are you doing?
 Doctor – (startled) I am writing notes on your fascinating case, it’s a thing that we doctors do you know.
 Ya, we doctors write notes all the time, in fact I am writing them now.
 Character 1- (reaches for the clipboard) May I see the notes?
 Doctor – (slaps the incoming hand, and clutches the clip-board to his chest) Nein!
 These are confidential, and, uhhhh, it would violate the doctor-patient relationship if I allowed you or anyone to see them.
 Character 1- Oh, sorry about that, well shall I take up where I left off?

I leaned in even closer in an attempt to drink in the fragrance, and heard the rustle of expensive paper as I brushed the note that had been attached to the rose with a simple green ribbon.
 My name was elegantly scrawled along the outside face in a script I'd only seen one other place.
 After a moment's hesitation, I unfolded the parchment.
 Your birthday should be a time of happiness.
 I've spent months looking for a name for this flower, and at the point of giving up, inspiration struck today.
 Lagrimas del Angel always come at too high a cost.
 Nothing so exquisite could be otherwise.
 Please don't despair.
 --@ The hand-drawn symbol on the bottom of the page was so familiar it almost felt like a part of me now.
 He'd saved our house, got Mom a job, and then given me the best birthday present I could've asked for.

The brother who for a while was all I had was completely estranged from me.
 I had put Thomas in a similar category as my biological Father, Richard.
 I considered that in both of their cases, nothing good seemed to happen when I associated with them so I just kept them out of my life and my family’s as well.
 The latest stories I had heard about Thomas were that while at one point he had escalated his abuse to injecting heroin, he then attended a drug rehab center called Narconon, which had apparently enabled him to be clean for the last couple of years.
 If this was true, and he was clean, maybe he’d be a good person to go to for help?
 My mother thought so, and she insisted that we reach out to him.
 We were obviously reluctant and for good reason, but we were also desperate.
 My mother insisted that Thomas’s last rehab stint at Narconon had worked for Thomas and she knew he had strong ties there and perhaps he could get Brandon in for treatment.
 She told us that Thomas was doing work for the rehab in the form of interventions and getting drug addicts into treatment and that was what Brandon needed.
 But at what price?

Liz – I haven’t seen him since he excused himself at dinner earlier.
 Cleo – Well should we go look for him?
 Jim – Why bother?
 Cleo – Because he’s your brother and you care for him?
 Jim – He’ll turn up eventually.
 Karen – What kind of attitude is that?
 Jim – The best kind to adopt when you’re dealing with Johnny.
 Cleo – What do you mean by that?
 Jim – I mean that he’ll be back when he’s ready to come back.
 Art – Perhaps instead we should go and see if we can get some more information about the fire, it should have made the news by now.

It is an important resource and should be familiar to you.
 You should have years of experience by now.” “Why don’t I?” He stopped.
 I could tell by his expression he hadn’t meant to say so.
 “Why can’t I use magic?” I clarified.
 “Why couldn’t I use it before?” There was another long pause and then he spoke carefully.
 “You were bound.” Bound?
 The word was so foreign in that context.
 All I could think of was the young children in the village, binding themselves to play the games of fairy children, who were unmagical until coming of age.
 I recalled seeing it in the documents in the briar patch—Francine Glaforia, bound against using all but practical magic.
 Bound.

Shouldn't he have just gone on and on until--unless--she told him to stop?
 But he was willing to bet that she had no idea where they'd been headed, and she was so passionate that she might have yielded to him without even thinking.
 And despised both herself and him when it was over.
 Marie pressed her lips together, trying to read Rick's expression.
 "Did I do something wrong?"
 "No, no--you did everything right."
 He sighed, taking her hand.
 "Marie, do you know what a man and woman .

Then the pages had changed.
 Now that she'd gone back to 1927, would the article have changed again?
 Not back to the way it had originally been, because he knew she wouldn't have married Davis.
 Would she?
 She would have been lonely and vulnerable when she'd gone back.
 Could Davis have won her back?
 Although he knew it would be torture, he went to his desk and dug out the pages about her.
 He scanned them for the information he wanted.
 Born 1904, daughter of Jefferson Tranton, one brother .

But if I thought I could never go home--"   She shuddered.
 "When I'm missing my family, thinking about seeing them again and thinking how ecstatic they'll be is the only thing that keeps me from complete despair."
 She opened the hand clenching the diamond and held it out to him.
 "I'm sorry, Rick.
 I love you, but I can't marry you."
 Reluctantly he took the ring, pocketing it as he watched her rise and head for the bathroom.
 She didn't know what he did—that she could go home tomorrow.
 She'd calm down, and then things would go back to normal.
 Eventually she'd accept that her life was here now.
 She'd have to accept it.

Larger private investment flows invigorated economic growth and made capital more accessible to larger numbers of people than ever before in human history.
 The European Union expanded to embrace newly democratic countries and blazed a path right through the former heartland of nationalism for the integration of the united peoples of Europe.
 Most important of all, the erstwhile very real and imminent threat of global confrontation and nuclear destruction radically diminished, spurred by negotiations between Russia and USA that have led to a 75 per cent reduction in the number of nuclear warheads stockpiled by both sides.
 ICPF’s report projected a vision of Uncommon Opportunities for rapid and radical advances in global peace and development.
 Its central thrust is the inextricable linkage between peace, employment, food security and human development.
 As peace is a sine quo non for development, creation of employment opportunities for all is essential for maintenance of peace and social stability, food security and eradication of all forms of poverty.
 The experience of the past decade strongly supports the view that a more peaceful global environment is more conducive for development.
 Military spending declined by a third in the years immediately following the end of the Cold War, partly due to real cuts in defence spending and partly due to the collapse of the Russian rouble and changes in the value attributed to Soviet arms spending.
 These real gains did not translate into a significant increase in foreign aid, which was what many hoped and expected.
 But that does not mean there has been no peace dividend.

“You smell… like morning.” I bit my lip, heat rising up my neck, but he lingered, breathing in the scent.
 “Ruby,” I said.
 He looked confused.
 “Soap.” I had been reduced to one-word sentences.
 “Oh.” He nodded, leaning back.
 “She does have a way with potions and such.” “I enjoy the mixing,” Ruby said, startling me again as she entered the house.
 “But not to worry, I keep it contained to elements and minerals, no breeding.
 I leave that to Steed.” She laughed at her own words as she passed us on the way to her room.
 I found myself reevaluating her now that I knew she was Steed’s sister.
 Chevelle noticed me watching her.

So, while I don’t disagree that it would be a good idea for me to practice some fighting skills, I also think we should all think of practicing magic.” She paused and said in a flat tone that highlighted her seriousness, “The Immortal Guards are made of sigil warriors who have sacrificed their ability to cast magic spells for one or more permanent enhancements.
 This makes them powerful warriors, but also limits their magic to the one or two sigil abilities.
 We need some sort of counter to this advantage.
 If we practice our magic every day, we should make a little progress even without any teachers or books.” She finished with an upturned eyebrow.
 She seemed to think that Rodregas was going to challenge her statement, and argue that they should just focus on the martial training.
 However, Rodregas had been a squire of the Order of the Soaring Heavens, one of the few orders that required magical learning of all its members and one of the few groups that knew the secrets of Sigil Searing, the permanent inscription of sigils onto one’s magic.
 Unfortunately, the secret of sigil magic was given only to those who made knighthood.
 Still, one had to learn enough magic to make the inscribing possible and that early training he had.
 “I totally agree,” Rodregas said.
 “I know only what is taught a squire of our Order, but that I am happy to share.

Without God, any nation will perish.
 And a nation is only as strong as its people.
 A better world requires better nations of better people.
 Christ can make us into those people.
 Billy Graham had injected some hope into at least one heart often shamed by its selfish and ornery ways.
 When he asked for all who would surrender to come to the altar, I stood and followed the auburn haired babe.
 About halfway down, I heard Cliff.
 He came behind me and said, “Are we sure about this?” I didn’t answer, only kept descending into the valley of whatever.
 Dark had fallen.
 Hundreds of us lost souls crowded in front of the portable stage somewhere around the goal line.

I was really getting into the story.
 I yawned and stretched, and then followed her out of the room.
 I was surprised at the size of the fort.
 We went down several corridors and passed a few doors before finally coming to a large, open arena where the others waited for us.
 Chevelle smiled at me as I passed him on the way to my horse.
 I started to command the horse to kneel, but then Steed grabbed me at the waist and threw me up.
 I took one deep breath before we kicked the horses into a gallop and ran from the fort in a pack.
 Our pace finally slowed as the way became too treacherous.
 Massive rock formations loomed over us, loose stones underfoot causing the horses to stumble.
 The haze was so thick I couldn’t see anything but the riders in front of me.

"I won't kiss you like I did yesterday.
 But I want you to know how very much I love you."
 She smiled, raising her lips to his for a brief kiss.
 As she wandered off, Rick focused his mind on the TV shows they'd watched last night.
 He replayed all the details of the plots, being sure that he saw, in his mind's eye, all the colors.
 Then he began thinking about planes, remembering his trip with Marie to Los Angeles.
 Then he thought about all the computer programs he used and how to troubleshoot them.
 He'd just started listing microwave products in his mind when Marie returned.
 He rose and went to hug her.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart," he said, immediately kicking himself for his hypocrisy.

“Why do we need to leave?”
 “Your work is almost done,” Qurrah said.
 “The walls are repaired, and half the men who worked with you have already been cut loose.
 I, however, have much to learn but cannot do so here because of prying eyes and attentive ears.
 I need privacy.
 I need silence.”
 “What for?” Harruq asked.
 “No,” Qurrah said.
 “Don’t ask when you full well know the answer.”
 At this Harruq nodded.

He glanced back to the shed, cursing his idiocy for not retrieving his weapons while he had the chance.
 “The coin,” demanded a guard to their right.
 “Hand it over.”
 “No,” Harruq said.
 The leader rammed his fist into the half-orc’s face.
 Harruq staggered but held his ground.
 Blood ran down his face, and he spat some away from his mouth.
 He waited for another punch, but nothing came.
 The man was staring in total disbelief at the weapon he held.
 As he had stepped closer to punch, the gem at the end had shimmered a soft green.

I probably would've spent the rest of the day depressed, but once she was out of my line of sight I was able to see the boy following her.
 He was incredible.
 Just looking at him drove every other thought out of my mind.
 If the girl who'd just walked by me without acknowledging the existence of any of us lesser beings was every boy's ideal physical specimen, the boy was every girl's dream.
 A gorgeous fantasy breathed into life by some merciful goddess, one who wanted to give us each a glimpse of what awaited good little girls in the afterlife.
 Skin that was a gorgeous shade of tan, not at all artificial-looking, disappeared into the collar of a thin, light-blue button-down shirt.
 The cut of his clothing hinted at designer origins, but the garment was mostly notable for the way it stretched over a pair of broad shoulders that looked like they'd been chiseled from marble, or possibly cast in bronze.
 My eyes made it as far as the equally impressive chest before I forced them upwards.
 Anyone built like that should be ugly to keep things in balance.
 Not him.

Half the businesses in the town are owned by my family, the other half are owned by Alec's mother."
 The revelation was a bit of a shock.
 I'd known all along they were both ridiculously rich, but them owning the livelihood of nearly every person in the town was mind-boggling.
 Brandon seemed to know where my thoughts were headed.
 "Pretty amazing, huh?
 Anyways, I've been raised to believe I have an obligation to the town, to the people who work for us.
 Part of that includes making sure other people with substantial resources don't abuse their power."
 It was probably about as good of a chance to find out what was going on under the surface as I was going to get, but something inside me shied away.
 It was like I'd be entering a new world, one in which some of my illusions would be shattered.
 I'd have to face a colder interpretation of certain people's actions.

“If given a choice,” Qurrah asked, “would you split a seed or burn a flower?
 Let the children meet their end before they learn the torment and anguish of their parents.
 Besides, kill a child and the mother has one less mouth to feed.
 Kill the mother or father and all the children suffer and starve.”
 The larger half-orc shrugged.
 He was not convinced but that mattered little.
 He would trust his wiser brother as he always had.
 Qurrah let his eyes drift back to the fire.
 “Tomorrow night, bring me a body, but don’t let yourself be caught.
 A gruesome execution does not suit my immediate plans.”

We were talked about but you had to be part of the cognoscenti, the insiders.
 I hated this, if I was aware of it—I really don’t remember.
 Keep in mind, all I wanted to do was play my guitar and write songs.
 And I was writing at an astonishing clip and artists were picking up on it, and, well, the money started coming in.
 See, in a way, I was fortunate.
 I never had to sack groceries at Piggly Wiggly or teach school, or cut lawns.
 Writing songs, I learned early, brought in the bucks.
 And a lot of the talent coming out of Nashville, well, a lot of those guys were singing my stuff.
 See, at that time, everyone wanted to play and sing, but not everyone could write.
 So I wrote.

Maybe one or more of them held me down.
 But I threw a few kicks.
 Either they accomplished my intention or Tony or someone pulled the Polish guy off me.
 Then the others followed.
 I heaved myself up and made for the door.
 Outside, with the temperature something below zero, I trudged and slid up the sidewalk the few blocks to Tony’s place.
 His mom had given me a key.
 No one was home.
 In my previous life, with a few brief exceptions, I had avoided fistfights by using my size (I grew up fast) and a rather savage look I could muster.
 So I hadn’t known murderous rage.

“My soul to be made one through the flame,” he whispered, and then the circle of blood and living organs started to burn and he burned.
 He burned so deeply that no scream crossed his lips.
 He felt every fiber of his being simply burn.
 Rodregas tried to scream, but no sound could pass his lips.
 CHAPTER 2 FROM THE ASHES
 When Rodregas awoke he was confused about why he was lying on the floor.
 As he opened his eyes he was also alarmed to see Captain Poir looking down at him with a confused and worried expression.
 Captain Poir said, “Master Ravenhurr?” It was a question.
 Rodregas wondered why his captain would think he was the Master.
 And then suddenly it all rushed back to him, all the details of the final ceremony.

 There was only one thing you could be when a boy in that decade and that was tough.
 Everything else was weeny.
 I wasn’t tough.
 I was wispy and blond and too pretty.
 And I got bullied relentlessly.
 Pushed to the ground, laughed at when I tried to join in during P.E..
 I started dreading recess, you know.
 I just wanted to stay inside and read or write songs in my looseleaf notebook.
 I hated school, hated those bullies—hell, I still do, I hate bullying—but music was my out, or, I guess my in.

Britney looked particularly unhappy.
 Mrs. Campbell was looking at my homework when I reached her desk.
 "I was prepared to tear into you for not going to the tutoring lab last night, but that hardly seems fair seeing as how you went ahead and did the work by yourself."
 I felt a small glow of satisfaction flare into life, but her next words ensured it didn't get out of hand.
 "Of course, you've got the right answers, and technically you're attacking the problems correctly, but you're leaving out a couple of steps that I think will give you problems a bit later on.
 Please take my advice and spend a little bit of time at the math lab.
 Even if you can't make it every day, you need to come in a few times a week."
 "Yes, ma'am."
 The scolding actually hadn't been that bad, almost like disguised praise.
 Britney looked like she was hoping for something similar, but Mrs. Campbell's expression quickly dashed that idea.

And when I asked him why he wanted to be a knight…” she paused then added, “he said that some ‘Infernally damned knights’ have to stand up and fight.” “So you think he is a good man?” Rodregas asked.
 “I think Geriodon is a ‘holier than thou’ stick in the mud, who needs to learn to bathe and not mumble when he speaks.
 And yes, he is probably one of the only men here that actually deserves knighthood.” Rodregas nodded and said, “What about Nordien?” “Nordien is the polar opposite to Geriodon; smooth and friendly… and tried to have sex with me within our first conversation, which was also the only decent thing he said during our conversation.
 He seems to really dislike Geriodon and Karun.
 He comes from a strong blood line and rich family and feels he should already be a knight and not be forced to be in the tournament.” “So, why is Nordien in the tournament and not knighted?” Rodregas asked.
 “From what I can gather, Nordien is very friendly with the Immortalists, including the Ambassador Van’dret, and most people believe that he only wants to be knighted so that he can then leave the knighthood and join the Immortal Guard.” Rodregas nodded.
 That was not too surprising; since such ex-knights are usually made officers.
 Greater sigils were much more rare in the Guard than the knighthood, not to mention the officers of the Immortal Guard lived in much nicer style than the knighthood.
 “The Knight Commander might not be willing to stand up to the Immortalists, but he would be more than willing to skip over giving knighthood to someone who was planning to leave anyhow,” said Rodregas.
 They had made it to the stables and Doi’van started to put the saddle and tack onto Doom Hoof, the horse that Doi’van had been riding.

“Come on,” Jeremiah said to himself.
 “Hang it all, come on!”
 The half-orc held both swords out wide and roared at the remaining three facing him.
 When they held their ground, Jeremiah could bear the sight no more.
 He charged, screaming the cry of one expecting to die.
 He did not get far though, for a sharp burning pain enveloped his wrist.
 His arm jerked back, and the sudden force spun him to his knees.
 As he knelt there, a voice spat down at him.

Jim – It’s not fantasy damn it.
 The Canadians are coming.
 Eugene – Sure they are.
 Johnny – Right after the Martians.
 Jim – I hope you like watching hockey, because in a few short years it’s all that will be on television.
 Mark my words.
 Eugene – Your words are marked.
 But what do we do when you’re wrong?
 Jim – I won’t be wrong, eh.
 Johnny – What was that?

Let me answer that first.
 I was a sergeant in Ravenhurr’s guard and I am afraid I have become what I learned to hate more than anything, an Immortalist.” Rodregas paused and took a deep breath.
 What he said next was hard even for himself to say, “In truth, I am an old man who had his time on this world and did not do much with it.
 But now I have stolen the body of a very promising young man.
 I will die feeling guilty for what I have done, but I plan to take a few of you with me.
 Now, it is my turn for a question,” he said.
 Rodregas hoped that Imeralda would do whatever she was going to do soon; the conversation was escalating and he did not think they had much time before things got deadly.
 Rodregas asked, “Why did the Immortalist Taiga capture my friend Doi’van and keep him in his Menagerie of Earth, Sky and Fire for two years before selling him to Ravenhurr?
 He is a Hellborn and should have been of no interest to those trying to become Celestial Gods.” Van’dret became very still at this question, for a long moment he neither moved nor spoke.
 Rodregas wondered briefly if he even breathed or if the powerful sorcerer had moved beyond such mortal needs.

“It’s a 1920s theme dance.
 We’re going to dress up in period clothes and dance the Charleston.
 It’s going to be a lot of fun.” “Hmmm.” “Really.
 I’m going to drop a book off at your office some time today.
 It’s got pictures of people from the ‘20s, so you can get an idea of how to dress.” “Aren’t we still having dinner Thursday?” “Yeah.
 But I don’t want you to use not having enough time to plan as an excuse.”  In the last few months, she’d tried to fix him up two or three times.
 Whenever she showed a friend a picture of her gorgeous brother, the girl would immediately ask to be set up.
 But Rick had refused every time.
 She hoped that getting him to commit to the benefit dance would at least force him to ask someone out.
 She knew he was lonely, and she couldn’t stand seeing him shut himself off from any prospect of a relationship.

 "Why were you kidnapped?
 We never received a request for ransom."
 "I don't know.
 Um, Mother, could we have some cocoa?"
 Mrs. Tranton hugged her daughter.
 "You could ask us for the world right now, and we'd get it for you."
 Marie laughed.
 "Just cocoa, thanks."

Even so, there still wasn't quite room for them to walk side by side.
 The girl was leading.
 Her dark, wavy hair and flawless skin would've made her pretty in any crowd, but she also had perfectly symmetrical features and one of those bodies that required hours each day in the gym to maintain.
 I wanted to hate her.
 It didn't make any sense, she could hardly be blamed for taking care of herself, but it just didn't seem fair.
 Simply by being in the same town as us, she automatically made every other girl in school feel like bloated, heifers.
 Surely she was somehow cheating to be doing so well in the subtle, nasty game in which every high-school girl ranked herself against every other female.
 I probably would've spent the rest of the day depressed, but once she was out of my line of sight I was able to see the boy following her.
 He was incredible.
 Just looking at him drove every other thought out of my mind.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN
 Tears were streaming down Marie's cheeks when the fog began to lift.
 She was in her own garden.
 She ran to her house, tearing open the door and dashing upstairs.
 She paused at her room long enough to toss her bag onto her bed and then dashed to her parents' room.
 "Mother!
 Father!"
 She banged on the door.
 The door opened, and her father stared at her in shock.
 Her mother, however, jumped out of bed with a cry of joy and threw her arms around Marie.

Emily, tell us what to do.” “Alright, boss,” she said sarcastically.
 “Everyone come over.” We walked over to her and the dragon with Seth leaning on Jason.
 The dragon was lying on the ground, watching us closely.
 Its long, leathery wings were tucked neatly on each of its sides.
 It snorted as Emily climbed onto its back.
 I stared at her, starting to think she was a little crazy.
 “Come on!” she said and patted the dragon's back.
 “Do you think that you're too heavy?
 Well, you aren't, so get on his back.” I walked over and climbed onto the dragon's back.
 Jason half hauled Seth on the dragon's back, and Seth almost fell on me.

This suggests that violence at the international, national and community levels cannot and will not be eradicated before poverty itself has been abolished, and that, if poverty is left unaddressed at its source, further economic progress is likely further to aggravate conflict in society, unless we are able to extend the benefits of progress to everyone.
 This realization would be quite disconcerting were it not for the fact that we are fast approaching the time when both these persistent ills of humankind can be banished forever – the way slavery and colonialism were banished in the past.
 The recognition that it is neither desirable nor possible to go backwards adds urgency to our efforts to move forward.
 Revolutions of the past have been partial and localized negative reactions against an existing social order, and benefited only a small part of society that, in turn, blindly resisted change.
 They resulted in war and usually much destruction.
 The revolution of rising expectations is a positive, constructive movement spreading to encompass people at all levels of all societies around the globe, and pressing for the establishment of a higher social organization that can meet the expectations of all humanity.
 But the energies liberated by this revolution have to be properly converted into an evolutionary effort for development, otherwise they will fly off in unwanted directions.
 Society must provide the conditions and opportunities for these energies to express themselves positively and constructively in pursuit of their own fulfilment.
 Education is the most essential ingredient for this transformation.
 It is a great leveller of social hierarchy.

My wife and I held each other as we watched him back out of the driveway.
 He couldn’t even look at us as he drove away to God knows where.
 We were numb.
 Our son was 6’2” about 135 pounds and addicted to one of the most powerful drugs on the street: Oxycontin.
 What would happen to him?
 Would he get busted again, overdose or die in a drug deal gone bad?
 We contemplated the worst as we watched what was our son, our first-born, drive off into complete uncertainty.
 We didn’t know Brandon at all, and we really believed we might never see him again.
 On the day of his birth which seemed like yesterday, I had watched as his little body took its first breath and now I felt like I might be watching him take his last.
 We chose not to tell any of my wife’s family because we were quite frankly, embarrassed.

All my adult life, I have worked to support other people.
 I don’t mind day jobs or sharing what I earn.
 But my day job performance suffers when my mind veers off to the stories I want to get home and write, and I suspect my stories could be richer, more passionate and imaginative, more intuitive and maybe inspired, if they didn’t always get interrupted by my day job.
 Sure, Franz Kafka was an office worker and William Blake a printer, but Kafka didn’t live very long and Blake had no kids.
 Anyway, those guys were geniuses.
 Not me.
 So I worried, would the baby help squash my writer’s dreams.
 People heard I was going to be a father again and asked, "So how old will you be when the baby turns eighteen?"
 or "What if you die?"
 She’s a girl, the doctor said, and I reasoned a girl might be quieter, a little more gentle than a boy.

They wandered around, and what caught her eye was not all the silver, gold, turquoise, and leather that the natives thought an American tourist would want but the colorful things like serapes and bajas--Mexican blankets and pullover jackets.
 She found a pink and turquoise baja that she fell in love with.
 The price was ten dollars, and Marie talked the owner down to six dollars.
 "I did it!"
 she exclaimed, taking her baja from the bag.
 "You did a good job."
 "This is fun.
 Why don't we get you one of these?"
 After buying Rick a baja, they bought a multi-colored blanket and a leather purse.
 Marie loved bargaining, but the only other thing she saw that she wanted was a little glass carousel that she managed to get from ten dollars down to five.

She took her toothbrush and put toothpaste on it.
 "I understand.
 But that doesn't make it any easier."
 Tossing his washcloth into the clothes basket, he picked up a brush, and when she straightened after having brushed her teeth, he began smoothing her hair with long, slow strokes.
 Marie closed her eyes, tears seeping from them.
 She stood still for as long as she could, but finally, unable to bear the tenderness of his touch, she turned around and took the brush from him.
 "I'll never be able to go to the shore or drive a car or-or shop for bathing suits without feeling pain because it'll make me think of you.
 I don't want to have to stop brushing my hair."
 He smiled just a bit.
 "I don't think I'll ever go to the beach again."

“How so?”
 He chuckled.
 “It may sound odd, but I can see his eyes.
 They burn like fire.
 He dresses himself in the black robes of a priest, and I cannot find his tracks come the morning.
 That doesn’t happen, Aurelia.
 If it moves, I can track it.
 And I can’t find a thing.”
 “These two brothers are certainly a mystery,” Aurelia said.
 “When will you meet this other brother?” Dieredon asked.

 Anything I have I have because of Lorelei, because of me.
 I don’t owe the past anything, Memphis anything, music, rock and roll, the fans, those idjits with their t-shirts and lunch boxes and designer drugs or whatever.
 I owe Buddy Gardner.
 I owe him everything.
 What I have I earned and I don’t care what anyone else says, what Hudson says, or any of that shit, I just care about Lorelei, about me.

"Can I join you guys?"
 Her voice was scratchy, and her eyes were red from crying, but she was putting on a brave face, and Rachel didn't even hesitate.
 "Of course, Jess.
 We figured you wanted some privacy with Isaac, or we would've dragged you over here hours ago."
 The rest of us were quick to pipe in, but at least on my side, the sentiment was a little half-hearted.
 Unlike Jasmin, Jessica never had come around, never made her peace with the fact that because of me things were going to go downhill in a hurry after tonight.
 I'd tried to get both Rachel and Dominic to explain why she hated me so much, but neither would give me a real explanation.
 Rachel would always just get mad and say there was no excuse for how Jess was acting.
 Dominic always refused to say anything other than that Jessica had been through her own set of struggles, and had her reasons for her behavior.
 "I'll be done with Dom in just a moment, Jess, then I'll fix your hair while Rachel finishes up with Adri."

A new publication identifies a few hundred self-employment opportunities of this kind.
 The future of work will offer increasing opportunities for people throughout the world to match their specialized knowledge and skills with specialized employment opportunities wherever they may originate.
 Meeting the Skill Shortage: Perhaps the single greatest opportunity for employment growth lies in addressing the growing mismatch between the skills of job seekers and the skills required for expanding economies.
 In both industrial and developing countries, workers may be in surplus, but the skills needed are in deficit.
 In the most prosperous nations, the deficit is concentrated in high technology and professional sectors, in electronics, biotechnology, health care, pharmacology, mathematics, marketing, financial services, and the like.
 The adoption of new technologies even in traditional occupations has resulted in a growing demand for higher skill levels in these fields as well.
 Unemployment is highest among the least educated, least skilled categories, such as machine operators, fabricators and labourers.
 The poor are poor both because they have no assets and because their time and labour have low or no economic value.
 Poverty persists wherever the human resource is under-valued.
 To eradicate it, there is need for a paradigm shift from unskilled to skilled work.

When he shifted in his seat, I realized he was built like a football player.
 Not like a lineman, but like a running back, or maybe a quarterback.
 He wasn't as big as Brandon, or even as Alec, but he was obviously well muscled, and he moved with an echo of their grace.
 None of which helped me figure out where I'd seen him before.
 He wasn't a regular at the tutor lab, and didn't have the hectic, desperate look of someone cramming for a test.
 Instead he looked completely at ease sitting in one of the no-man's-land tables with a pair of books open in front of him.
 By the looks of things he wasn't going to need any help.
 Once it was just the four of us, Britney waved me over and held up her homework.
 "I don't get it.
 What is the answer to this one?"

I felt dizzy again.
 She hauled me off the bed, supporting me as I stood.
 She was much smaller than I had thought, slipping easily under my arm.
 I kept my head down as we walked, mostly trying not to get ill, but also unable to look Steed in the eyes.
 I watched Ruby’s heeled boots as she led me through the main room and to the door to her bedroom.
 “A bath?” I asked, confused.
 She laughed.
 “Well, yes.
 A little cold for lake bathing here.” She led me to a large basin in the corner of her room.
 Water streamed in from the window and filled it halfway.

Faster and faster the two figures changed places, and then they disappeared.
 It was like my mind was a computer that'd overheated and had to reboot.
 I opened my eyes and met Rachel's worried gaze.
 My pulse was still elevated, and I was breathing too hard.
 It seemed impossible for Britney and Jackie not to hear and realize something was up, but a quick look verified that they were still lost in their respective inner worlds.
 "You just had another fainting spell, didn't you?"
 I felt my eyes go wide.
 Nobody here was supposed to know about that.
 The more people who knew, the more pity I'd see in everyone's eyes.
 All that pity would then make it hard to want to continue fighting, hard to want to do anything other than just curl up in my room so I could avoid them all.

It is the result of human aspirations turned into action, human energies expressed in thought and work, human imagination and creativity turned toward the upliftment of life, the invention of processes and products to enhance human productivity, the accumulation of knowledge and wisdom passed on from one generation to another, the acquisition and perfection of skills transmitted from parent to child, the conversion of talents into capacities, the pursuit of ideals, an ever widening of attitudes, and the evolution of more complex and productive forms of organization.
 As this evolutionary process unfolds, each element of human personality -- physical skill, vital relationship, mental understanding, spiritual values – is enhanced in a progression without end, bringing with it greater material fruits, richer life experience, and higher knowledge.
 The unfolding and flowering of the human being is at once the source and the goal of development.
 Thus, in all our efforts to elevate human society, our primary endeavour must be to enhance these human endowments and expand individual freedom of self-expression.
 Peace, democracy, employment opportunities, food security, education, training, access to information, cooperation, freedom of action and a spirit of innovation are the essential conditions and means for this process to advance.
 There was a time when humanity’s progress was primarily the result of the collective efforts of the community, demanding and obtaining the strict obedience and conformity of its individual members to preserve what it had created and further the progress of the collective.
 That point is now past.
 In the century now commencing, the individual human being must come into his own as a free and creative force.
 The groundwork has been prepared by the spread of democracy, human rights, universal education, gender and social equality and, more recently, information empowerment.
 The power of individual awakening is responsible for the revolution of rising expectations that has fuelled unprecedented rates of growth and social transformation during the past half century.

The guard flew into the bushes with a sickening crunching sound.
 Rodregas next heard the sound of another of the enemy and spun into the sound using all his speed and strength, hoping to take a guard with either advantage.
 His target proved to be a slaver.
 He had a ragged beard and held a small battle axe.
 Rodregas’ sword blow was too fast for the guard to block and had the strength to stun a guard wearing regulation armor.
 His sword cleaved the guard in half, and a gout of blood and gore splattered him.
 Rodregas pulled his sword free and spun away from the mess.
 As he came to rest the sound of arrows was quiet, part of his mind knew that Imeralda was backing deeper into the forest.
 As he cleared the mess he had made of the last slaver, Rodregas came face to face with an Immortal Guard.
 Behind him were two more slavers.

Only that wasn't quite the term for it.
 The power, the energy that'd become more than oppressive, was sucked towards Alec and Brandon, dragging with it my strength, and the unnatural vitality of the rest of the pack.
 I felt a lance of pain sink into my back, mirroring the jolt in my ankle, as all five shape shifters collapsed around me.
 I knew with a certainty I was going to die, that we were all going to die, but that didn't matter.
 It was only right that my existence cease within heartbeats of Alec's.
 Chapter 31 As the normal grogginess of sleep wore off, I realized just how thirsty I was.
 I reached for a drink, hissing a little as my stitches pulled against the still-healing skin, but the glass of orange juice remained steadfastly just beyond my fingertips.
 Alec appeared immediately, paint-speckled and undeniably alive, from where he'd been working in his studio.
 "I really wish you'd just call for me when you need something.
 All of this moving around isn't going to help your back heal any more quickly."

it's not that."
 "What's wrong then?"
 She frowned.
 "Do you think another girl from the past might come into your garden?"
 He laughed.
 "I doubt it.
 Of course, I would have bet my life that not even one girl from the past would walk into my garden."
 He glanced down at her again.
 "Why?
 Would that bother you?"

He flexed his arm and stared at the growth that traveled all the way up to his neck.
 He felt within himself a lifewell of energy, one infinitely deep.
 “Discard your swords, Harruq,” Velixar said.
 “You are the protector of my disciple.
 You deserve better.”
 He slid his two swords out from their sheaths, stunned by the ease in which he moved them.
 It was if they went from being made of steel to air.
 He tossed them aside.
 Velixar pulled from within his cloak a chest the size of a small stone.
 He placed it on the grass where it shone gold in the light of the stars.

But the music was important, it flowed through him, this cat.
 I saw him once, in a tent show—Furry was there—and he just blew everybody away, played with a broken bottle for a slide, old shitbox guitar—and he just blew everybody away.
 He’s in here man, in me, in all the cats who came after.
 That’s Memphis.
 That’s what I’m talking about.
 You wanna talk heritage, Memphis is lousy with heritage, with a lineage like no place else.
 And it’s so pure, man.
 It runs like a crystal stream, or like Big Muddy, runs through all of us.
 I’m proud to be from Memphis, man.
 Don’t write nothing else.

But if so I would have drawn whatever it was that'd been in the foreground.
 I was even worse than normal when it came to drawing people or animals, but I had a good memory for everything else.
 I pushed the notepad away in frustration, and then started shaking as I finally recognized my drawing.
 It was the grotto from my dream, and the reason I hadn't filled in the center was that I'd never seen it.
 That was the spot where Alec had been standing.
 Chapter 13 Morning came not a moment too soon after a night filled with tossing and turning.
 Every time I nodded off, I awoke a few minutes later, my mind reaching for something that wasn't there, only to snap back as it didn't find what it was looking for.
 Each time the backlash woke me up, I tried to figure out what was going on, but I didn't succeed until nearly morning.
 I'd been trying to find the vivid dreams again.
 I'd finally stopped thinking about them, finally stopped yearning for them every night, only to have my stupid subconscious somehow mix them up with real life.

It was incredibly small.
 It was probably on its second generation of students, but looked pretty good still.
 The linoleum floor was faded, but still relatively clean, and the white paint on the walls was conspicuously free of tags and gang signs.
 The students even seemed to be mingling fairly easily with each other.
 I actually kind of missed the feel of armed camps.
 My school hadn't been bad compared to some stories I'd heard from California, but there'd still been some kids beaten pretty severely for crossing the wrong group of wannabe gang members.
 Britney had a piece of pizza, and looked like she was eyeing a piece of cake until she noticed I was trailing along behind her without a tray of my own.
 She actually sighed as she passed the cake.
 The urge to giggle was so strong I uncapped my water bottle and turned slightly to the side in an attempt to disguise my amusement.
 It was one of those moments I'd try to reconstruct in my head again and again.

He bellowed, letting the pain spark his rage.
 One archer continued to fire out the window, believing his companion capable of finishing a single warrior.
 He believed wrong.
 The elf fired only one more shot before Harruq crossed the room.
 The arrow lodged into Harruq’s side, and then Salvation tore through his bow and into flesh.
 A kick sent the remains tumbling out the window.
 The other archer pulled back and fired at point blank range.
 Harruq roared as he felt a sharp pain bite into his neck.
 His mind blanked.
 He dropped his swords.

The transforming power of information under glasnost opened up Soviet society to events in the outer world and created widespread awareness of the alternative approaches and achievements of other nations.
 Information brought down the Berlin Wall, ended the Cold War and ushered the world into a new era.
 Information about economic opportunities and potentials is an essential ingredient, a catalyst, of the development process.
 In the past, development strategies have tended to place too little emphasis on the power of public awareness to release people’s energies and initiative on a massive scale.
 The vast accumulation of knowledge and new technology for rapid dissemination of information that the world possesses today can be utilized to increase the speed of change, eliminate many false starts and wrong turns and much unnecessary suffering.
 The goals and strategies recommended in this report aim to accelerate the process of political, social and economic development by creating greater public awareness of desirable and achievable objectives and releasing the initiative of individuals and institutions to pursue them more vigorously.
 Information is the most powerful catalyst for this process.
 The speed and extent of knowledge transfer are far from optimal between and within nations – even within industrially advanced nations – due to lack of information, out-dated attitudes and beliefs, lingering superstitions, and conventional wisdom.
 Ignorance and scepticism about new opportunities are characteristic of development at each stage and in every field of activity.
 Information about success stories helps overcome this resistance and spurs people to action.

_Then kill her._
 “Aurelia?” he asked, as if seeing her for the first time.
 “I didn’t mean to, I, Aurry, please…”
 He knelt down, his blades falling from his limp hands.
 He pulled away Aurelia’s hand to see the blood, to see the wound.
 “No,” he said.
 He rocked backward, the color draining from his face.
 “No, I didn’t mean to, I didn’t…‌I didn’t…”
 Aurelia tried to say something, tried to comfort him, but no noise came from her throat.
 She was dying.

Her mouth fell open.
 "You're betrothed?"
 "No, not yet.
 Carolyn and I are very serious, but I just couldn't think about proposing to her while you were still missing.
 But now .

 well, Mother has told me she's ready to give me the ring the moment I ask."
 Mrs. Tranton smiled.

She is handing a baby bottle towards a car seat in the back.
 A young boy sitting in the front passenger seat stares back at me as if to say, “What are you looking at?” I was once that baby in the backseat and my brother that inquisitive one in the front.
 My father wouldn’t have been in the car either.
 He disappeared long before I could commit him to my young memory.
 Chapter 4: The Sixties and the Single Mom I don’t remember many details of my early childhood.
 As much as I try, I cannot visualize my father, Richard, in any setting.
 I remember my mother, my brother, grandparents, babysitters, uncles, friends, and different events but I just can’t place my father anywhere.
 My parents divorced in the early sixties and my brother Thomas and I were very young.
 We took a train ride from Kansas to California; my mother told us we were on an adventure.
 We were far too young to comprehend divorce so there was no reason for her to explain.

He staggered right, clutching his shoulder as he slumped against the front of a home.
 “Qurrah!” Harruq shrieked, racing to his brother.
 Qurrah shoved away his clumsy attempts to examine the wound.
 “Kill him for me,” the necromancer gasped.
 “Go!
 He cannot live!”
 “But you’re bleeding real bad and…”
 “I have the healing potions, now go!”
 Harruq’s gut screamed against the idea, but in the end, he listened to his brother.
 He drew his swords and gave chase.

Whoever lived here was either incredibly well read, or a complete poser who bought books just for show.
 Almost scared to find out which it was, I reached over and pulled out the copy of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, and opened it up to find a well-cared-for book that'd still obviously been read several times.
 I carefully slid the book back into its spot and then noticed the faintest glimmer of light coming from an open doorway off to my right.
 It was an art gallery.
 One covered in pictures that were eerily familiar, all with a circular signature at the bottom right hand corner.
 They were mostly of mundane kinds of things, landscapes, or people, but there were overtones that caressed a hidden chord inside my soul.
 Everything was done in drab, painfully boring colors, overlaid with incredibly vibrant, hues that were almost unreal in their perfection.
 It wasn't until I'd moved around a corner and entered what looked like a new phase for the painter that I figured out why the paintings looked so familiar despite the fact that I'd never seen any of the places or people depicted.
 The realization hit with such force that it distracted me from the familiarity of the signature.
 The new pieces were all breathtaking.

 Is she gone?
 Liz – (Rather startled) What the hell is wrong with you sneaking up on me like that?
 Jim – Shhhh!
 Is she gone?
 Liz – Yes, my mother is gone, and I think she promised not to bother you any more.
 Jim – Finally.
 What do you mean ‘think she promised’?
 Liz – Exactly what I said, I think she promised to behave.

We went out to dinner, went to parties, sometimes just sat quietly reading together.
 But best of all, we would walk or sit on the beach for hours talking.
 He was wonderful, and I loved him with all my heart."
 She paused, smiling as she reached out to touch a lock of Marie's hair.
 "Every time we kissed, I felt it all over."
 Marie's eyes flew to her mother's.
 "Why didn't you marry him?"
 Mrs. Tranton's face sobered.
 "He died.
 He drowned trying to save his little cousin."

Instead she was probably freaked out.
 I'd have been so much better off if I'd just stayed oblivious to everything, and ignored her like I'd done everyone else today.
 The hot Utah sun was trying to knock me to my knees as I slowly made my way down our lane.
 For a moment I thought about what would happen if I fell and hurt myself.
 By the time Mom realized I was missing, I'd be a perfectly preserved mummy, sucked completely dry by the harsh climate, exactly as ordered for a pyramid burial.
 I hadn't realized some part of me was hoping Mom would be there waiting when I got home.
 I felt it shrink as I came around the corner and saw the empty cement pad.
 I walked through the door and dropped my things on the couch.
 I could feel myself sinking back into oblivion, but instead of welcoming it, I was suddenly terrified.
 I'd spent weeks numb to the entire world.

You are going… we are going north?” “I’m sorry, Freya,” he said.
 “I let you down at the creek.” His gaze fell to my hands, which closed instinctively into fists, protecting the newly-scarred palms.
 “I was distracted.
 I should have been paying closer attention.
 I should have prevented this.” Regret was thick in his voice.
 I could only stare at him, mystified.
 He explained, “It’s too late now.
 You’ll never rest until you’ve followed the map.” He was wrong; I’d forgotten my plans, surrendered to my captor.
 I had thought it was over.
 “Yes,” I answered boldly, the word echoing with the thrum of my pulse.

Even if it were true, you're hardly the type to give away the upper hand by coming out and telling me so."
 Alec's eyes had taken on the serious, resigned expression that'd become disturbingly commonplace lately.
 "I know.
 I think that last part bothers me the most, but I find myself doing so nevertheless.
 Make sure you wait at least half an hour.
 There's a definite element of danger to all of this."
 ** I must have checked the clock sixteen times during the last five minutes of the obligatory half-hour.
 The sensible, grownup part of me was arguing for another five minutes just to make sure, but I told that part to take a flying leap and all but ran through the house looking for Donovan.
 "Yes, mistress?
 Do you need something?"

“May I be released now, wretched spawn of mine?” Ahrqur asked.
 “Yes.
 Go rest in your shame.
 I have no use for you.”
 The spirit gave Qurrah one last glare then dissipated into the fading light.
 Silence filled the room.
 “Well, what did you think?” asked Harruq.
 “I think,” Qurrah said, “that was enjoyable.”
 The two paused, each thinking the same thing.
 Finally, Harruq voiced his thoughts.

“We are… unruled.” “Unruly,” Steed added with a laugh.
 “You’ve never had a council?” Grey shook his head.
 “No rulers?” He gave Steed a sidelong glance.
 “Not anymore.” I could tell he intended to end the conversation with that but it only made me more curious.
 I was tired of always having to make everyone spell things out for me.
 “No council ever.
 No rulers… anymore?
 So what then?” Steed flinched at my tone, but didn’t answer.
 “Frey,” Chevelle called from the front of the line.

He watched the arrows bounce off the magical shield, and then watched the human army charge and overwhelm the small elven force that had come to face them.
 “I will keep my word, Antonil,” he said.
 “Fly back to the others, Sonowin, we will battle this day.” The horse snorted, making Dieredon laugh.
 “No, I am sure you won’t be hurt.” Sonowin banked, giving the elf one last view of the battle before soaring east to where the rest of the Quellan elves waited atop their magnificent pegasi.
 His horse neighed a quick question, one Dieredon wished he could laugh at.
 “Everyone can be killed,” he said, tying his hair behind his head.
 “And no, I have no plans of breaking my ribs again.”
 The horse made an interesting little noise, one Dieredon had long ago learned was laughter.
 He smacked her rump, earning himself an angry neigh.
 “Fly on.

“We will not fail,” Qurrah promised.
 “Where will we meet you?”
 “Listen for where the screams are at their worst,” Velixar said as his shadow began to fade.
 “There shall I be.”
 A pale hand reached inside his robes and pulled out five glass vials.
 Qurrah knelt and accepted the gifts.
 “The vials contain powerful healing elixirs.
 If either of you are injured tomorrow, drink from them and resume the slaughter anew.”
 “Thank you master,” Harruq said, accepting three from his brother before kneeling as well.
 “We will await you in the chaos,” Qurrah said.

Human capacity increases the more it is drawn upon.
 It can never be exhausted.
 Developing the human resource should be the centrepiece of all development strategy.
 We can solve today’s most pressing problems if we adopt a total approach which takes into account all the interrelated factors – political, economic, technological, social and environmental – rather than relying on partial strategies.
 Partial remedies, however welcome or desirable, can always generate side-effects – such as the increase in social tensions and violence observed when increasing political and social freedom are not matched by increasing economic opportunity, or the rise in unemployment and arms exports that accompany a reduction in defence expenditure.
 The success of the Green Revolution was due to its integration of technological, institutional, commercial and public policy measures, while its short comings arose from its failure to integrate environmental factors, which are now being incorporated in agricultural development strategies.
 Comprehensive measures can eliminate the side-effects of partial progress.
 The progress of the whole depends on the progress of all its parts.
 Humankind is infinitely enriched by the qualitative diversity of culture and individual expression, but it is immeasurably impoverished by the quantitative abyss which separates the more fortunate from the rest of humanity.
 The most prosperous levels of society cannot fully and finally rise to higher levels of accomplishment and enjoyment without first ensuring that the less fortunate and less productive are helped to obtain the full fruits of life at the present level of social achievement.

Art – It varies.
 A lot of smiling usually, for a while at least, but only until they get annoyed that we’re too dumb to read their minds.
 Jim – Damn our infernal lack of psychic powers!
 Art – Indeed.
 The most important thing you can learn is how to play dumb.
 And you already excel at that.
 Jim – I learned from a master.
 What more can you tell me about that whole predicting thing you were going on about?
 Art – I can’t really tell you the tricks, just keep your eyes open and remember what goes on around you.
 After a while you’ll be able to at least recognize some of their quirks.

The woman pointed to the bleeding half-orc.
 “I see plenty.”
 “Just cleaning up some filth.” The bowman shifted his bow onto his shoulder.
 “Now move along.”
 “I don’t see any filth.
 Some blood and dirt, maybe, but no filth.”
 Harruq closed his eyes and listened as he tried to slow his pulse.
 He had no clue who this Aurelia was, but if she wanted to intervene he was glad to let her.
 “This does not concern you, elf,” said one of the guards.
 Harruq coughed at this.

Tears were rolling down her cheeks, and her mother took her hands, examining her eyes anxiously.

 "I love you, Mother.

Who sent you here?” she asked.
 “Was it some mean man trying to toy with you?”
 “I’m sorry,” Harruq said before resuming his slack-jawed staring.
 Aurelia uncrossed her arms, those same soft features turning remarkably fierce as she glared at him.
 “Stop that.
 If you don’t shut your mouth, I’m turning you into a toad.”
 He shut his mouth.
 “So why are you here?” she asked.
 “I was just, um, I never got a chance to thank you.” Harruq felt his face flush.
 This was the most awful thing he had ever done.

Rachel didn't like me anymore, she'd never forgive me.
 I'd managed to alienate everyone from Alec's group, and now Brandon had tossed me aside like so much trash.
 It was too much.
 I collapsed onto all fours, hardly noticing the burning pain from my damaged palms, and let the racking sobs take over.
 I probably would've stayed there all night if not for the howling.
 It'd been going for several seconds before it pulled me back from the mental abyss I'd been so eagerly approaching.
 I looked around blankly for several more heartbeats before I finally managed to place the noise.
 Wolves.
 There weren't supposed to be any wolves in the area, but there wasn't any ignoring my ears.
 I numbly pulled myself back up, and began stumbling back towards the party, only to stop as another howl echoed down through the canyon.

David and I died in an ambush of what was left of Kojas’ army.
 Mackenzie died from a fatal fall, I don’t remember how.” “Oh,” I said and rubbed my neck.
 “I don’t want to be rude, but do you need to tell me anything else?
 I have to try to come up with a few explanations for back home.” A lot of explanations.
 June walked towards me until she was standing right in front.
 I could almost see through her body, which was really starting to freak me out.
 “You have to get back Seth,” she whispered.
 “I know David was supposed to see him right now and I know he’s disappointed.

Someone was playing a joke on him.
 His silence was making her uncomfortable.
 "If you could just point me toward Meadows Street .
 .
 ."
 He swallowed.
 “Do you know what year this is?” She frowned.
 “What year?” “Yes.
 You know, 1850, 1875, 1900 .

Also, if you can convince her it's safe to leave on an extended trip, that would be very helpful.
 Once she's gone, I'll come back for you."
 I opened my mouth to ask him what he meant, only to be distracted by the sound of the Jeep's engine as it rolled to a stop on the cement pad.
 As I looked back, Alec's eyes captured me.
 "You're sure this is what you want?"
 I managed a nod, and then the downstairs door crashed open.
 "Adri, honey.
 Where are you?"
 Alec was gone when I looked back.
 Only the slight sway of my curtains gave evidence he'd just casually jumped out of my second-story window.

Did you run off with a man?"
 "No!
 I would never run off and leave you wondering what had happened to me."
 She hugged her mother.
 "I love you, Mother.
 And I need--" "Marie?
 Davis is leaving."
 John had come in search of them.
 "Are you all right?"
 "We're just having a mother/daughter talk," Mrs. Tranton said as Marie reached for a napkin.

"I won't hurt you, Marie.
 You don't know how to get back home, anyway.
 Just trust me a little."
 She didn't want to.
 But he was right--she didn't know how to get home.
 Slowly she rose, not taking the hand he extended but following him inside.
 "This is a microwave oven," he told her, patting a white and brown box.
 "It cooks things really fast--it can heat something like rice in less than a minute."
 When he saw her incredulous stare, he opened the refrigerator and took out a bowl of mixed vegetables.
 "Feel."

The force of Jasmin's stare was almost a palpable thing; my knees got weak so quickly it was like she'd reached out and pushed me.
 I steadied myself and then tried to ignore the way my skin crawled as I crossed the rest of the distance to Brandon's table.
 "The mongrels unnerve you a bit?"
 The scorn on the face that the comment belonged to was unnerving.
 I'd seen him several times before, but didn't have a name to go with his aristocratic features.
 "That's enough, Vincent."
 A trace of rebelliousness flared up at Brandon's chastisement, but Vincent buried it so quickly I almost didn't have enough time to classify it before it disappeared.
 Interestingly enough, I could see Cassie out of the corner of my eye, and she didn't look any happier than Vincent.
 The rest of lunch flew by.
 I'd never realized how much fun it could be to belong to a group.

"It gives me no pleasure to tell you this, but based on your initial test score I think you should prepare yourself for the fact that you're probably going to fail this class.
 I worried this would be the result of your starting so late in the semester and not having any prior Spanish experience.
 Unfortunately, it's now too late for you to switch into another class.
 I'm afraid you'll just have to take the failing grade."
 I stood there woodenly for several seconds, unsure whether or not she was through.
 She finally made a shooing motion and turned back to grading papers.
 Predictably, there were still a half-dozen other kids in the classroom.
 They all turned back to the door and started filing out again, but by tomorrow half the school would know exactly how badly I'd just been humiliated.
 I found myself just outside the tutor lab with no recollection of having stumbled to my locker, or going by Physics to grab the stuff I'd left there.
 Still, somehow my Spanish book had disappeared, replaced by my math book.

They were half-orcs, condemned for the tainted blood coursing through their veins.
 The people of Veldaren hurled the word at them like a dagger, but in truth neither had ever seen a full orc before.
 “Now we’ll finally see,” Qurrah said, “what we are, what we are meant to be.”
 Thousands of orcs spilled into the west, needing no light to see in the darkness.
 They howled and cheered, drums and war chants mixing with the shrieks of the skulls.
 Harruq felt his temples throb.
 A wail rolled over him as a deathly comet swirled about, spotting the two and eying them like prey.
 Try as he might, he couldn’t stop from shaking.
 “Can you stop them?” Harruq asked, squinting at the sky.
 “Perhaps,” said Qurrah, eyes distant and unfocused.

This timely report should help to promote the idea of human-centred development within a culture of peace as a way forward to a better world.
 We are gratified that ICPF should have assigned UNESCO, as the intellectual arm of the United Nations, a prominent role in its recommended agenda for action, and we reaffirm our commit ment to working with all possible partners in pursuit of the goal of global peace and sustainable human development.
 Federico Mayor Director General UNESCO
 The International Commission on Peace and Food began its work at a time of uncommon opportunities for rapid transition on a global scale to democratic ways of life, freedom of the media, and an independent judiciary; food, literacy, health and jobs for all; and sustainable life styles based on harmony between humankind and nature.
 The end of the Cold War and the consequent shift of expenditure from defence to development, the onset of the Information Age and the organization of information superhighways, the growth of mechanisms for regional cooperation, a renewed faith in the United Nations, and commitment to multilateral negotiations and action all provided new opportunities for achieving global peace and prosperity.
 Rapid progress in the application of science and technology in agriculture, industry, and human health strengthened the hope that the concept of 'food, education, health and employment for all' can be converted from rhetoric into reality, provided the peace dividend can be deployed to achieve these goals.
 ICPF had the advantage of building on the work of earlier independent commissions, particularly those chaired by Willy Brandt, Gro Harlem Brundtland and Julius Nyerere.
 We began our work with the conviction that, as Willy Brandt said, 'the problems created by men can be solved by men'.
 The ancient Indian scripture, Bhagavad Gita, expressed the same sentiment by stressing, 'Whatever man aspires to, that he can accomplish.'
 The achievement of food self-sufficiency by India in a period when famine threatened millions of lives through the power of political will and scientific action in a democratic society illustrates this truth.

I tried, “I’m sorry I interrupted…” He nodded, but I didn’t know if he was acknowledging my interruption or pardoning it.
 He walked slowly toward the bed, glancing at Ruby’s things on the shelves and walls, and then sat on the bed beside me.
 I forced myself to continue breathing and kept my gaze down, knowing a flush was coming.
 He reached out and placed a hand under my chin, bringing my face up to meet his.
 The flush that followed was not from embarrassment.
 Heat flooded my neck, and I felt it might engulf me as he spoke my name.
 “Frey.” “Yes.” It was all I could manage.
 His eyes held mine and I could swear he was searching for something.
 He opened his mouth to speak, but the door of the wardrobe flew open.
 “Oh.” Ruby giggled the tiniest bit.

One archer continued to fire out the window, believing his companion capable of finishing a single warrior.
 He believed wrong.
 The elf fired only one more shot before Harruq crossed the room.
 The arrow lodged into Harruq’s side, and then Salvation tore through his bow and into flesh.
 A kick sent the remains tumbling out the window.
 The other archer pulled back and fired at point blank range.
 Harruq roared as he felt a sharp pain bite into his neck.
 His mind blanked.
 He dropped his swords.
 His hands closed about something soft.

"Growing up surrounded by this, and neither you or Rachel play an instrument?"
 Alec shook his head.
 "I've never had the finesse to play anything.
 Rachel took violin lessons for more than a year.
 I think she wanted to be able to play with mother.
 That was when she begged me to wire the house for sound.
 Donovan and I spent two weeks setting up mics in Mom's studio, and then another couple of weeks running sound into every other room of the house.
 She kept insisting it was so she could monitor Mother on the rare occasions when nobody else was home, but I used to hear her trying to play along to 'Courtship'."
 The trace of a smile on Alec's face lulled me into a false sense of security.
 "She doesn't play now though.

He had initiated the intimacy, and it would not be fair of him to pull away because of his personal doubts.
 “Easy,” Rodregas said, “I want to go nice and slow and enjoy every step.” They kissed again, this time eagerly exploring each other’s mouth and lips.
 He ran his lips down the line of her chin.
 Though he was trying to go slowly, they quickly found themselves naked.
 He thought if he had let her, she would have jumped right on him and slid himself inside her.
 Rodregas knew that Nymphs were legendary for their enjoyment of sex, but he was a little surprised at her eagerness.
 She ran her hands and lips across his chest, seemingly fascinated by ‘his’ powerful musculature and smooth skin.
 Once again Rodregas found himself pulling away from her touch.
 He had never really had a woman that eager to touch him before.
 Her eagerness to touch his body made him feel a little put off.

“Hey, I don’t have anything cool and deadly.
 Why do you both get something like that and I didn’t?
 It’s not like you can trust Jazell with something sharp or dangerous.” “Hey!
 We can’t trust you either.” I pointed out, crossing my arms.
 “Arming you is as scary as giving a kindergartener a knife.” She gasped.
 “Yeah, well, I’m ignoring you now.” She huffed and turned around.
 “There you are!” Jason exclaimed as he crashed out of the trees, panting.
 His wavy hair was a deep red that framed his eyes but he didn’t seem to have noticed its color change or to care.
 He was wearing an all black layered tunic and pants with boots that looked as light as mine.
 If I didn’t know it was Jason, I would have taken a huge step backwards at his assassin-like appearance.

This guard did.
 The Immortal Guard had already launched himself forward and Rodregas’ own speed worked against him.
 As Rodregas’ short sword hit nothing but air, he felt the sharp agony of the guard’s blade piercing his thigh.
 Rodregas used his speed to throw himself back.
 But as he did, he felt another sharp cut hit his upper arm.
 The other men were moving in now that he was off balance.
 Rodregas twisted as he fell and grabbed one of the slavers and brought him down.
 With a quick stab into his groin, Rodregas took the slaver out of commission.
 Rodregas rolled off his squirming body and threw himself up to a standing position.
 He almost immediately went down again as his wounded thigh buckled under him.

 The following night, Harruq slipped out into the street.
 Lamps were lit here and there, casting shadows across the road.
 Harruq stayed far from Celed, the elven side of town, since they sent all their children to be raised in Nellassar, deep in the heart of the Erze forest.
 It was the human children, especially the poor and the destitute, that Harruq sought.
 Of course, none would be out playing, not with so many dead and missing.
 He would need to take different measures.
 Not far from their home, a ratty building operated throughout the night.
 It was Maggie’s Place, half tavern and half orphanage.
 Maggie enjoyed the free labor and the ability to rant and slap her orphan workers without fear of reprisal while still maintaining the image of a heart of gold to her regulars.

The subtle shift of Velixar’s features slowed as he approached.
 When he spoke in his deep, rumbling voice, Harruq struggled against a sudden urge to join his brother on one knee.
 “So you are Harruq?” the man in black asked.
 “I am,” Harruq said.
 Velixar reached out a hand.
 It was frail, bony.
 So similar to his brother’s.
 “Kneel.”
 Harruq did so unwillingly.
 “I am Velixar,” he continued.

As I pass the beach camp at San Onofre where Eric and I spent a couple of my happiest weeks, I silence my I-pod and remember.
 Superman
 I was fifteen when, on Christmas night, I lost my dad to a heart attack.
 He left my mom and me alone in our house on a hill a few miles north of Mexico and near enough to the Pacific so that when Santa Ana winds blew the gunk away, we could see ocean and islands.
 My mom was a rock.
 Over the past few years, before losing my dad, she had helped bury her father, a sister, and two brothers.
 She was the one who always fed me, nursed me, brought home a monthly check, and covered the debts my dad’s failed business ventures had accumulated.
 But soon after that dreadful Christmas, she got stricken by headaches and became a hermit.
 Evenings she would withdraw to her room and lie with a cool cloth on her forehead, listening to the Lakers, the Padres, or Dodgers, or to whomever the playoffs featured.
 Even through the World Series, she hardly watched an inning on television.

Brandon seemed better and we thought we had helped him simply because we incarcerated him at home away from his peers until he had the drugs out of his system.
 In our mind, he was cured.
 Unfortunately, the problem had not been solved so easily.
 Like any good movie, this solution came too easily and too early in the drama.
 He was such a child then, easily influenced and dealing with challenges in counterproductive ways.
 He was caught being truant, being out past curfew, being with a kid who stole a wallet.
 He was involved in multiple car accidents.
 Brandon struggled and was barely making it through high school, so we changed him to a problem-child school to enable him to graduate.
 He and his younger brother Bryce were growing apart just as I had grown apart from my brother Thomas, which was torturous for me and Lisa to watch.
 Brandon dressed like some punk and believed he was the smartest person in the room.

The elf laughed a little but said nothing.
 Instead, she walked over and gave Harruq a quick peck on the cheek.
 “Keep your big butt safe, okay?” she said.
 The half-orc tried to answer but his mouth refused to cooperate.
 Somehow, it seemed to have become unhinged.
 Besides, it wasn’t as if he could think of anything to say.
 All his mind could concentrate on was the feel of the elf’s soft lips on his cheek, the flowery scent of her perfume mixed with sweat, and the quick brush of her breasts against his arm.
 By the time his jaw and mind began working again, Aurelia was laughing.
 “What’s so funny?” he demanded.
 The elf smiled.

I just-I just want to be with my family for a while."
 The thought of being courted was revolting.
 Rick had said that they'd both eventually settle for someone else and get married, but she had no intention of marrying anyone else.
 She would never stop loving Rick.
 After breakfast Marie felt restless and agreed to her mother's suggestion that they go shopping.
 But they'd no sooner begun browsing through the first shop than she began feeling panicky.
 She made herself look at dresses while her mother made her selections, but she wasn't paying attention.
 "I'm going to buy this one," Mrs. Tranton said, holding up a navy blue dress.
 "It's lovely."
 "Haven't you found anything you like?"

The study can be undertaken at very low cost by a consortium of researchers from different research institutes within the Commonwealth of Independent States.
 5.Privatize and develop road transport: Transportation is a major bottleneck to development of a market economy in much of the region.
 Under the centrally planned system, most freight was hauled by trains over main routes to large cities for distribution in bulk by huge government procurement agencies.
 Under a market system, millions of small producers and consumers must be free to buy or sell wherever the price is most attractive.
 This requires a vast proliferation of small goods transporters in the private sector, which are rare in many countries today.
 The large freight transport monopolies have to be replaced by entrepreneurial companies with small fleets competing for freight business.
 Immediate steps are needed to expand capacity and introduce competition in this vital sector by promoting the development of private road transport companies at the national, regional and local level.
 Special loan and leasing programmes should be established to enable small firms and individuals to purchase vehicles and pay for them out of the revenues generated from use.
 6.Regional models and pilot programmes: Pioneering initiatives need to be encouraged to act as demonstrations and catalysts for new types of activities in the country.
 In a region as vast and diverse as this and in countries such as Russia, which extends over eleven time zones, no single model or pattern will be widely applicable.

“Or maybe you'd prefer to sleep in the open.” “Uh I think I'll stay with that plan,” she said quickly.
 “But you're a grump Seth.” she pushed past him and headed the path to the cave.
 “You are, Seth,” I said.
 I followed Emily, with Jason and Seth on my heels.
 When we reached the blocked cave entrance, Seth drew his sword and sliced the vines apart.
 They fell to the ground and the cave was revealed.
 We walked inside the dimly lit space and I sighed in relief at some safety.
 The air smelled musty and I had a feeling no one had ever been here.
 I sat on the floor next to Emily and the boys sat on the opposite side of the floor.
 “We should all get some rest,” Seth said with a yawn.

A bright light flashed and I saw a ghost-like girl disappear in the darkness.
 My eyes widened as I saw Seth and then darkness.
 But not before the voice said one more thing.
 “Beware of each other.” *** I opened my eyes and shot up so fast my head collided with Seth's.
 I clutched my head and said, “Ow.” Seth stretched his arm to rub his eyes.
 “What's wrong?” he asked.
 I shook my head.
 “Nothing.” I looked at the beads of sweat on his forehead.
 “What's wrong with you?” “Nothing,” he said.
 “I'm just hot because when someone sleeps on someone else, that person kind of gets hot.” “What do you mean?” He shook his arm.

Individual hugs from Brandon followed for each of us, and I thought he would squeeze me to death.
 When he held his mother his face was red with emotion and tears.
 One hug stood out and lasted the longest: When Brandon and his brother hugged, it was intense!
 It was something for a father and a mother to see, especially given all of the circumstances.
 Their embrace looked like complete and total forgiveness in a hug.
 They were whole and all the animosity that had built for years drifted away as they held each other so tightly.
 They looked like one tangled tree trunk from their feet to their heads.
 Their arms were wrapped high around each other’s shoulders and you could barely see their faces.
 It was a moment for my wife and me and everyone around us knew how special it was.
 Brandon was now over 180 pounds, which filled out his 6’2” frame well.

You need to get past that block, to use your defense as instinct.” I really didn’t want to play anymore.
 But before I could protest, a black rock hurtled toward me.
 My hand jerked up automatically to swat it away but my arm hit an invisible wall.
 The rock slammed into my face.
 I was fairly certain my nose was bleeding from the impact.
 I tried to slow my horse but no longer had control of him.
 “Again,” Chevelle warned.
 The rock was coming for me a second time.
 I tried to duck out of the way but the wall was there once more, blocking me from moving.
 I cursed as the stone glanced off my cheek.

“They are not asleep,” Qurrah said.
 “Something keeps them awake.
 I fear they know of our arrival.”
 “Velixar?”
 “I believe so.
 He tests us again.”
 Harruq patted his swords.
 “So be it.
 What’s the plan?”
 Qurrah could see two men positioned on either side of the campfire.

One of many reasons why I'd never really pursued drawing.
 A short time later I surfaced again and looked down to find a familiar landscape.
 The body of water had morphed into an oblong pond with a crescent island positioned almost exactly in the center.
 I still remembered the first time I'd been told a monster had taken a bite out of the island, and that was the reason it was so oddly shaped.
 The trees were all familiar too.
 I'd climbed each and every one of them at least once.
 The one on the right had taken the longest to conquer.
 I'd tried climbing it dozens of times over the years before finally making it to the top when I was thirteen.
 When I'd finally made it as high as I figured was safe, I'd worked my trembling way back down to the ground, and never felt even the slightest inclination to climb it again.
 I felt tears start to gather at the corner of my eyes as I remembered all of the good times our family had spent together there.

I did what I did because when I close my eyes I still see you there."
 My heart jumped up to my throat, but in a good way.
 "I don't know why, not really.
 Your incredible, unearthly beauty helps, as does your stubborn determination to continue soldiering on, despite how badly you've been hurt.
 That doesn't explain it all though.
 Neither does the fact that you stepped in and saved Rachel from a beating I couldn't stop."
 He reached up and tucked a stray hair behind my left ear.
 "Whatever the reason, since your arrival here, I just feel like parts of me that were missing have come back home.
 Even when I thought you were some kind of...rogue...shape shifter come to destroy my pack, I was still drawn to you."
 My stupid eyes were tearing up again.

The old man dropped his torch and wobbled on his legs.
 His elderly arms, already shriveled, shrunk even more.
 Skin tightened against his frame, and in seconds it was if the man had become a living skeleton decorated with flesh, hair, and clothes.
 The man took a staggered step forward, still determined to fight Qurrah even as his arms struggled to bear their own weight.
 He let out a moan of unintelligible loathing.
 “You are not worth my time,” Qurrah told him.
 “So consider this an honor for your determination.”
 He began casting, relishing the feeling of control flowing throughout his body.
 Never before had he felt so powerful, so invincible.
 He prayed the night would never end.

I have no idea who he meant or if what he said means anything.” Emily scribbled down, Toad dwarf said, “He’s rising, he’s rising”.
 Who’s coming and is he important?
 I stared at the paper, the question swirling in my mind.
 Who did he mean?
 “Now what did the dwarf tell you, Seth?” she asked.
 “He said, ‘You won’t stop him, little warrior.’” He frowned at the last part.
 Emily added, Toad Dwarf told Seth, “You won’t stop him, little warrior.” Does this mean he’s powerful?
 “Did you have to add the ‘little warrior’ part?
 It makes me sound weak.” Seth complained.
 “I did because we need all the facts.

I mean, I don’t have AAA or any kind of roadside service insurance because every time a car of mine has broken down, it’s been a block or so from my mechanic’s house.
 Except one time.
 “The one time my car broke down in an inconvenient place, a guy stopped to help me, and he happened to be the handsomest man I ever saw.
 Maybe he was an angel.
 I don’t know.
 But it sure was fun breaking down.”
 With the time Olga didn’t spend laboring for the sake of acquiring stuff or treating herself to luxuries, along with writing and prayer, she attended gatherings of all kinds where she could meet folks who needed her to teach, or console, or pray with them.
 She chose to live much like Jesus, who passed through the world keeping a lookout for people he could help.
 The Secret
 I could use Olga’s comment that a family or business person might need a bigger house to justify my bigger house.

Suspension of voting rights or of the privileges of membership should be the ultimate penalty for the failure of governments to comply with this condition within a reasonable period of time.
 The affirmation of democratic principles cannot and will not stop with the domestic governance of member countries.
 It is inevitable that the same principles be extended to the relationships between the nations that make up the international community.
 The present structure of the UN system is a product of the Second World War, just as the League of Nations was of the First.
 The Allied powers conceived it at the height of the war and evolved its structure to reflect the immediate post-war realities.
 Russia, the USA, France and the UK emerged from the war as the arbiters of the world order.
 The defeated Axis powers, Germany and Japan, were relegated to the back ground.
 Mainland China had become communist and was therefore excluded from the power structure.
 India and the other colonies had not yet gained their freedom.
 In recognition of the mutual suspicions between Russia and the Western powers, the rule of unanimity usually adopted by political conferences was applied to decisions made by the five major powers that became the permanent members of the Security Council.

 Oh, it was going to get really interesting.
 The ground rumbled and we both stopped dead.
 I looked at the earth and cracks appeared.
 Then dirt started to cave in.
 I screeched as the ground gave way under me.
 Can my life get any worse?
 *** “Emily,” Jason said, “I heard something.” Emily's head jerked up and then she remembered that Jason was below her and she looked down.
 Jason was staring at the plains below the edge.
 Emily climbed down the tree and ran over to him.

As my feet scuffed along the path, I heard angry whispers and glanced up to find their source.
 Virden Day was leaning toward a dark figure, wearing a harsh expression and pointing out fingers on his other hand.
 Counting reasons for his argument?
 The figure turned his head as if scanning for an audience.
 He found one—me.
 As his eyes hit mine, I had the feeling I was intruding, that I should look away, but something kept me staring.
 It was him again.
 Chevelle Vattier.
 I swallowed hard and forced myself to continue walking, this time determined not to trip.
 Following the path as it wound closer to them, I became excruciatingly aware it was going to split, heading to either the gate or to the library.

“Yeah okay, whatever.” Seth shoved his hands in his pockets, and glared at the ground.
 I sat on one of the swings next to Emily.
 I traced the sticky metal rings and sighed.
 Emily was on her phone.
 I saw Seth and Jason arguing off to the side.
 Everything was back to normal.
 There was even a dwarf climbing the slide.
 Wait, hold on.
 A dwarf?
 I elbowed Emily in the arm, “Uh Emily, is a dwarf using a slide a normal thing?” I nodded in the direction of the dwarf and her eyes widened in surprise.

 I love the sound of that…

He is but a distant cousin to the king, spoiled and stupid.
 He carries orders to the elves of Woodhaven: leave or die.”
 “They will never leave,” Qurrah said.
 “They are stubborn and will defend their homes until death.”
 “It is more than that,” Velixar said.
 “The Quellan elves have already been pushed across the rivers by the Mordan people.
 Both races of elves fear for their existence.
 Celestia has grown distant to her clerics.
 Mankind breeds like mice while the elves find themselves gradually dwindling.
 A man fighting an elf is like a grain of sand blowing against a stone, yet strong winds and fields of sand can reduce the sturdiest of boulders to dust.”

 She shook her head, turning a page.

 There's a man named Stephen Hawking--" "He's a very well-known scientist."
 "Then maybe what this article says could be helpful.
 But I can't understand it.
 It has all these strange words--wormholes, white dwarfs, odd things like that.
 I can't follow this at all."

“Thank you,” I croaked as I took the cup, my hand trembling.
 “Shouldn’t have left you alone,” he said quietly.
 There was a tinkling laugh in the front room and I groaned.
 She was here, too.
 The water helped.
 I was able to sit up with Chevelle’s assistance.
 Ruby swirled into the room, dressed in a red frock of sorts.
 The color hurt my eyes.
 “Here, a bath will help.
 Come with me, dear.” Her hair was tied halfway back with a scarf, the tattered ends mingling with crimson curls.

I took a step back, and reached for the door, hoping to beat a quick retreat before I could humiliate myself further, but he stopped me with a surprisingly gentle hand.
 "I'm sorry; that didn't come out as intended.
 If it would help you sleep, of course I'll come upstairs and sit with you.
 It's the least I can do after allowing you to be dragged into this mess."
 Alec followed me upstairs, and then slid down the wall to sit on the floor as I sat down on my bed.
 As soon as I was comfortable he reached up and flipped off the light.
 "Hey, I can't see you now."
 His laugh was like silk.
 It reached out, and smoothed away the last of the embarrassment.
 "The deal was I would come up here so you could sleep.

 Liz – Stop bringing that up!
 God, don’t you people ever forget anything.

I tugged at the tie and the string fell away.
 I sucked in air as I opened the lid.
 It seemed like I couldn’t quite catch my breath anymore.
 Reaching inside to draw out the long white gown, I could not fathom Junnie’s reasoning.
 But she must have gone through much to get me this package.
 Numbly, I stared at her words while I unfastened my shirt and sash.
 The pouch I had rescued from the vault fell to the bed.
 How had I forgotten?
 I kicked off my shoes and pulled my top and pants off before sliding the gown over my head, straightening the length with my hands.
 The corset laced tight at my waist, the plunging neckline lower than anything I would ever wear.

"It was all just a dream, and you don't have anything to be sorry about.
 I don't mind you being here.
 I'm sorry I had to leave you alone for so long, it was inexcusable."
 I wanted to say something, wanted to tell Alec he didn't need to worry about me, that I'd spent enough time by myself lately to be happy with my own company, but the words wouldn't come out.
 The sheer pleasure at having him hold me so close was like a drug.
 I could feel the pleasant, tingly sensation I'd started associating with his touch, and it was like the best full-body massage, tied up with chocolate and reading a classic.
 Unaware of my mild state of euphoria, Alec continued on.
 "Actually, I owe you another apology.
 When I returned and found you here I meant to carry you to your room.
 I was only going to sit down for a second, but apparently I was more exhausted than I realized.

I grabbed his coat and forced him to look at me.
 He smirked and I couldn't hold back the urge to slap him.
 I slapped my hand across his face so hard it left a mark on his cheek.
 “Start talking,” I snarled.
 “Who are you guys and what are you doing?” The faery jerk smirked again.
 “We're part of Kojas' personal guard.
 We were sent to look for you half-lings.” “Well I want you to know something,” I said and got closer to his face.
 “We will win this fight, mark my words.
 Kojas is going down, way down if you know what I mean.” “Well,” he said, “if you let me go I'll give him your message.” “I don't think so,” I whispered.
 “You can tell him when he joins you.” I rammed my knife into his stomach and pulled it out.

I started to bristle; I even took a breath to explain what'd really happened.
 Only the truth wasn't any better than the story he'd fabricated.
 It was worse even.
 I'd much rather this cocky, spoiled, rich boy be mad at me than feel pity.
 I'd had enough pity from my mom to last years.
 "You bet.
 Think they bought it?"
 I tried to inject the proper amount of blonde stupidity into my words, but wasn't sure it worked until I felt Alec's arms tighten almost painfully around me.
 I gasped, and he set me down so quickly I almost fell over.
 Before I'd even regained my balance, he was walking away, moving so quickly I would've needed to run to keep up.

I have a theory about teenagers; basically they could be walking off a cliff towards a canyon and you could yell and scream warnings all you want but your time would be better spent packing them a lunch so they could eat it on the way down.
 Numerous attempts to let Richard in our lives always ended in disaster.
 I know it is natural to want to know who your father is.
 Unfortunately sometimes he is a complete jerk.
 Richard is just not a good person; actually he is quite the opposite.
 It was difficult for me to discover that my father’s lifelong friends didn’t even know he had sons.
 Besides being an alcoholic his whole life, I found out he was a first rate con-man.
 He was a womanizer, with a taste for young girls, and a big time loser.
 When I did try to let him into our lives, he was verbally abusive to me, my wife and even my children.
 The final disaster with Richard followed a family vacation.

 Lor came in that morning and I was sitting there in my clothes waiting for her.
 We checked me out.
 We went down to the nurse’s station and said, room 1324 checking out.
 (laughs)  It’s funny now.
 But, then, it was like we were doing something extraordinary and perhaps not entirely wholesome.
 We drove home in compete silence.
 And when we got home, we undressed as if it were all scripted, as if this was the end of that chapter.
 And when we were both naked, we fell together into the bed.
 And we fucked and cried and cried and fucked and it was all ok.

Through keen eyes I watched below, surveying a massive structure of dark stones.
 Then I was a wolf, running through those stones, hunting, searching, protecting.
 My muscular shoulders tensed and released with each long stride.
 I was myself again, though strong and confident.
 Two statuesque elves, twinned in white, glided past me.
 Lightning struck around me, cracking the dark stones of the walls.
 Reed of Keithar Peak stood before me and suddenly I was on a pedestal, looking down as he wagged his tongue at me.
 I scorned him, burning a chunk of it off, and he smiled.
 I jolted awake, the smell of burning flesh still lingering in my senses, and was staring at Ruby’s ceiling.
 Curse her.

He nudged the man next to him, who grabbed the quill.
 “Give me your name,” he asked, dabbing the tip into the ink.
 “Harruq,” he said.
 “Harruq Tun.”
 “Well, Harruq,” Alvrik said, slowly nodding his head.
 “I’ll see you right here at sunrise tomorrow.
 Got that?”
 Harruq grinned ear to ear, even his nervousness unable to diminish his excitement.
 “I’ll be here before the rooster knows it’s dawn.”

“What do you mean, I was speaking English and so was the dragon.” I shook my head.
 “No you weren't, you were making grunting and growling sounds.” “That's odd, I didn't think I was,” she said.
 “I told the dragon that we were four half-lings who needed shelter from the rain.
 Then he asked if we were against Kojas and I said yes, that he was hunting us.
 Then he told me that he would let us use his cave because he was on our side.
 Then I thanked him and here we are, inside the cave nice and dry.” “Maybe that's your power, you can speak to dragons,” Seth suggested.
 “But I don't understand how you two get powers and we don't.” “Be patient,” I said.
 “Yes,” Emily murmured and stifled a yawn.
 “Girls first, Seth.
 Have a problem with that?” “All right then,” he said and leaned against the wall.

It wasn't until I heard the other door swing shut that I realized James had followed us through, but he'd taken the door on the right instead of the one of the left that I'd been holding open for him.
 Wow, talk about a chauvinistic pig.
 It wasn't worth getting bent out of shape.
 I let my door swing shut, and walked over to Rachel's side so that I could see the entire parking lot.
 Empty as it was, it didn't take very long to realize Britney's little white Saturn was gone.
 "I thought you might still be here."
 The voice caught me by surprise.
 I probably would've jumped and screamed a little if I hadn't recognized it.
 Brandon was walking towards us with his characteristic casual stride, and I felt my heart speed up a little as I remembered our conversation from earlier in the day.
 "Brandon!

I wanted to just collapse and let unconsciousness overcome me, but something pulled me onward towards the next series of pictures, and then the next after that.
 I wanted to stop.
 Each piece opened up another fragment of my soul, revealing a new pain that I'd kept hidden for the last few months.
 The last picture was next to a door, which I opened almost without realizing I was doing so.
 The organized confusion of a true artist met my gaze.
 I'd seen it with my mom, when she was so driven to complete a shot that she couldn't be bothered to clean up after herself.
 She left just enough structure to the mess to find needed tools, but didn't waste any effort on anything that wouldn't help her with her great aim.
 Brushes were scattered everywhere, old and new canvases stacked in the corners of the studio, and flecks of paint had found their way onto almost every visible surface.
 The rich smell of paint was nearly overpowering, but I noticed it only in passing as I made a beeline towards the easel that dominated the center of the space.
 The painting was still wet, right down to the signature which had been done in the palest green.

I stuck my tongue out at him, and started back through the book in search of the missing information.
 There were so many other ways I'd rather be spending our time together, but he was adamant I not fall further behind in my classes.
 I looked up to ask for a hint, and found him staring off into space.
 "Penny for your thoughts?"
 His smile was a half-hearted thing.
 "Mother is playing again.
 She just finished up with 'Courtship', so the next one will be 'Welcoming'."
 It was amazing how quickly I could forget his supernatural abilities.
 Most of the time he seemed so normal.
 If you could consider any gorgeous, well-built boy who happened to be interested in me normal.

Kojas stepped to the side and blocked his path.
 Seth gazed up at him and I saw his eyes blaze in hate.
 “What do you want?” he snarled.
 “Seth, I think you know what I want.” “Never!” The faery chuckled and I saw his greasy hair bounce up and down.
 “You seriously think that I assumed you would walk away with me?
 Oh, I had no intention of it being this simple.” I knew what he meant, and I yanked my bow off.
 I pulled my arrow out and notched it, aiming it at Kojas’ back.
 “Jazell, wait!” I didn’t turn around as Emily and Jason skidded to a halt behind me.
 I didn’t drop my bow either.
 “Wait Jazell,” she panted.

I closed my eyes and blacked out.
 I didn’t really black out but that’s what I thought at the time.
 I opened my eyes to find I was sitting on the ground next to my sleeping body.
 I saw Emily sitting there, saying nothing for once.
 Something fell off my back and I picked it up.
 It was a wooden bow, and when I reached behind my back I felt a quiver full of feathered arrows strapped there.
 I ran a finger over the smooth, dark wood and turned to see Seth crashing out of the woods.
 I smirked at him and pointed at his head.
 “You have dark blue hair.” I giggled, not knowing why I was giggling after what had just happened to us a few minutes ago.
 He frowned and pulled a piece or two out of his head.

When they put his stinking corpse into the ground I will dance on the grave and sing a happy little song.
 Art – (Takes Karen aside) He’s not going to be hurt by this dear.
 Karen – But his father could be dieing in a fire.
 Art – Yep.
 Karen – Why?
 Why doesn’t he care?
 Art – I’ll fill you in later.
 Now isn’t the time to talk about it.
 Eugene – Where’s Johnny?
 I thought he’d like to be here when we finally got some good news.

He shot me another wink; I couldn’t be sure he was kidding.
 The tearing and popping noises ceased, and I examined his creation.
 Quite impressive really.
 He didn’t even seem to be watching, let alone concentrating.
 And no blessings on it, no thanks to Mother Earth.
 It seemed he was just enjoying himself, not being responsible to the magic.
 Magic that I needed.
 That I wanted.
 He was good enough, there was no question of that.
 He’d definitely be able to teach me.

When he slept, I went into the bedroom to see if his chest was inflating with air to assure me he was still alive.
 It reminded me of when our boys were babies and sometimes we would check on them in the night or as they napped and we never left the room until we verified they were breathing just because that is what a parent does.
 Chapter 15: Happy Frickin’ Holidays!
 As Thanksgiving approached, our traditions looked impossible to pull off.
 We were evasive when we called my wife’s parents to tell them not to come to our house as they usually did.
 We said we had some personal family issues to deal with.
 We could tell their feelings were hurt, but we didn’t feel we had any other choice.
 We did allow my younger brother Harry in on the whole awful situation and invited him to come to the house as planned.
 I needed my younger brother because he had developed a great relationship with my boys.
 He’s 11 years younger than me, and in the music business where he works shooting videos for rap artists my sons listen to.

“Go inside, you dumb fool!”
 She cracked her staff across his back.
 Harruq stumbled into the portal and vanished.
 Aurelia stepped in after, arrows landing all around her.

 Qurrah watched the blue portal close, leaving him alone and hunted in a town full of enemies.
 “Brother, how could you?” he asked, dread clutching his throat.
 Elves were running down the alley, yelling in their language.
 Qurrah ducked back around, cursed his brother, and then darted to the nearest home.

I spun my hand and lit the room to better see.
 It was a large ivory box tied with tweed.
 There was a small note under the knot.
 Dearest Elfreda, I must away without saying goodbye.
 I am sure you cannot understand, but please trust in me.
 Don this immediately.
 —J.
 I tugged at the tie and the string fell away.
 I sucked in air as I opened the lid.
 It seemed like I couldn’t quite catch my breath anymore.

I'd been hoping to be able to put off actually putting the dress on for at least another half hour, but when my makeup had finally been pronounced satisfactory, Jasmin had studied me for a few minutes, pulled my hair back, secured it with a pair of silver combs I was worried might actually contain genuine diamonds, and then helped Rachel cram me into the dress.
 If Jessica hadn't grudgingly complimented me on just how good my hair looked, I might have suspected Jasmin was trying to purposefully make me look worse than the other girls.
 Dominic and Rachel had to tell me I looked good, that was an unwritten girl-rule regardless of what species you were.
 Jessica had no such imperative, so I was forced to conclude Jasmin had done the best she could considering what she had to work with, and resigned myself to being the homely one in the group.
 Still, seeing all of the other girls in one place, fully decked out in the kind of shoes I'd always wanted to wear, but never been able to pull off, was even more intimidating.
 I was once again psyching myself up to be seen in public, when Donovan limped into the room and cleared his throat.
 "The gentlemen have at long last arrived."
 Isaac was the first one through the door, looking particularly 007 in a tux that amazingly enough had the occasional silver thread that matched perfectly with Jessica's dress.
 I looked up from his outfit just in time to see a flash of concern melt away into relief.
 I had just a moment to wonder at the novelty of Isaac showing that much emotion all at one time, and then James stalked through the door in a tux that was so cutting edge, that I wasn't sure if there was anything else like it anywhere in the States.

A couple weeks passed before Bill Torrey came and asked if I would mind him taking Liz out.
 No problem, I said.
 In my heart, Billy Torrey was my little brother, and would be for years to come.
 We would play music and perform together in a coffee house, until he married and moved away.
 Not long after our one date, Serena died in a car crash.
 I didn’t go to her funeral.
 I hadn’t minded her snitching to Liz.
 She was a sweet girl, and Liz was her friend.
 But I had seen too many funerals.
 Then Billy Graham came to town.

Maybe he wasn't feeling well.
 Taking his hand as they returned to their blanket, she asked, "Are you feeling all right, Rick?"
 "Yeah, I'm fine."
 "Why don't we go home so you can rest since you have to go to work tomorrow?"
 "It's still early."
 "We've been here several hours already.
 Let's go home and read the paper and nap and order a pizza tonight.
 Then maybe you won't feel tired tomorrow."
 He slid his arm around her waist, pulling her against him.
 "I love you so much," he said as he bent to kiss her.

The fish was in the net.
 The girl, Ashley, had taken the bait, and I felt confident that I had the deal working.
 Now I would need to go home and hope my wife’s level of understanding would allow me to be completely honest with her about what I was doing, and what I had just done.
 I knew Lisa wanted to help Brandon and we both knew my involvement would require a venture into unchartered territory but I needed her to know everything.
 Lisa and I had been married for twenty-four years and we knew what lay ahead would be a bigger test of our commitment than what I had just done.
 We needed to help Brandon and I needed to believe this would also help the kids I was attempting to bust, just as my son getting busted was one step closer to hitting bottom, and hopefully one step closer to getting off of these powerful drugs.
 There was no turning back now.
 Before I got home from my massage, my crack-berry phone rang and it was Ashley.
 She called me to ask if I could bring her a few Oxys to hold her over for the night.
 I, of course, didn’t have any Oxys so I told her I couldn’t get out and we could do the whole deal at once.

I cherish every moment with her.” Rodregas’ heart sank at the news.
 Life with the powerful healer would be a far better one than one with his lost crusade.
 “Since you would ask me such a personal question, I have one for you.” Jordaan responded, “You are clearly struggling with what it means that Imeralda is a half Nymph, but have you thought about what is means that she is a half AElf?
 AElf maidens, when they mate with an AElf man, form a spiritual and magical bond.
 It is a bond that lasts all their lives and connects them on multiple levels as no other race is connected.
 That is why the AElves take so long to choose a life mate and almost never choose one outside of their race.
 They mate for life; not out of choice, but because that is required of their nature.” After Jordaan finished speaking he stood silently as Rodregas sat up in bed and thought on the healer’s words.
 “She is not as free with her body as most Nymphs,” he said.
 “No, she is not.
 She only lies with men who she truly feels a great respect for,” Jordaan answered.

Your friend already hurt himself learning that.” Seth wasn't looking so good.
 He was bent over and was grabbing at his neck.
 I then realized that the snake was now a smaller brown colored snake and had its whole body wrapped completely around his neck.
 I had an awful feeling that I couldn't help Seth without hurting him.
 I was helpless.
 Emily and Jason were farther off fighting their own swarm.
 I could see from here that they were slowly losing too.
 Emily continued to try to fry the creatures or knock them away with air, but it wasn't really working.
 I kept seeing Jason's knives fly off into the woods, or sink into the ground, instead of hitting their mark.
 “And now half-ling,” it whispered with joy, “you die.” It lunged up at me.

“We will partake in our own way,” Qurrah said, kneeling beside the orc.
 The savage clutched his stomach, his hands the only thing holding in his innards.
 Qurrah’s thin, ashen face curled into a sneer.
 Harruq turned away.
 Perhaps his brother would think him weak, but he would not watch.
 He heard a sudden shriek of pain that morphed into a long, drawn-out moan.
 As the last of the air left the orc’s lungs, Harruq turned around, startled by the sight.
 “Beauty in all things,” Qurrah said, purple light dancing across his face.
 “Especially those things that are controlled.”
 An orb floated above his open palm, seemingly made of thick, violet smoke.

In the rain, with their semis, they spray torrents at my windshield.
 But recalling that yesterday I got blessed for choosing not to judge, I begin to practice understanding these truck drivers’ concern for time and distance.
 Soon I notice that when I go into critical mode, my awareness of the proximity to God shuts down.
 Praise, love, adore, perhaps even admire or commiserate with someone, God joins in.
 Condemn, I’m on my own.
 So, I have found a new rule to live by: the more I criticize or judge, the less the Holy Spirit cares to hang with me.
 Who could blame her?
 When the traffic spreads out, I find time to think about the story I heard at Chapter’s Books, and about how I would answer God if he told me to ditch Zoë.
 The first words that come to mind are, “Get lost, please.” I listen to my I-pod until a song reminds me, if I hope to achieve the peace Brother Lawrence lived in, I need to surrender.
 I think about Olga's poem and begin to doubt I should pray those words.

But, yeah, we were cracking up even as we rose.
 Maybe rising causes dissolution, right, you can dig that.
 Like Icarus.
 Or, it’s like Adam and Eve, you know, paradise is full of apples, full of snakes.
 We were in paradise briefly, as we cut that album, made those songs happen, we had it all, chicks, drugs, some money—though they screwed us of course.
 We should have been bigger, gotten better contracts.
 I don’t care about that.
 But, I do care about my songs, man, my damn songs.
 I wrote ‘em and they’re mine and no one can ever take that away, turn the clock back, rewrite history.

Addressing these challenges will require a substantial increase in financial resources devoted to education.
 In most regions, public expenditure on education has risen in recent years.
 In 1990, the world average was 13.5 per cent of total government expenditure, or 4.8 per cent of GNP.
 More than one-third of the countries in the world still spend more on the military than on education.
 Efforts to improve education must go hand in hand with efforts to promote peace and disarmament and drastically curtail military spending.
 Mechanisms should be put in place to insure that a significant portion of reduced military spending is invested in education and training.
 The very highest social priority should be given to six educational goals in both developing and developed countries.
 First, there must be a massive effort to achieve UNESCO’s goal of eradicating illiteracy worldwide by the year 2000.
 The problem can only be banished by an all-out commitment of every national government to eliminate the huge backlog of illiteracy, while at the same time insuring that every child is taught to read and write.
 National youth service corps and military personnel can be utilized to help provide the necessary manpower.

But it also seems meet and right that one should try.
 Lennon said something about nothing being new in rock after “Great Balls of Fire.”  In a sense, he’s right.
 I mean, I’d never question his authority.
 But, we still try, right?
 He still tries, God bless him.
 Is “Like a Rolling Stone” better than “Great Balls of Fire?”  Is “Working Class Hero?”  If so, why?
 The lyrics.
 That’s what you really have to talk about, the lyrics.
 I don’t think anyone would claim any rock song is today’s “The Second Coming,” –except, maybe some critics who want to call Dylan our Dante.
 But, the words are what’s become important.

He had tried to keep them from finding me as they attacked, tried to keep me from calling out to her.
 The look of fear, the look of sympathy.
 He’d held me back to save me.
 Tears streamed down my face and my body began to release from the dead weight.
 Chevelle had saved me from my mother’s fate.
 How long had he been my watcher?
 In the memory, he’d fought to keep me from seeing, tried to cover my eyes.
 And later, he’d pulled me from the water, dragged me away as we fled.
 I shook with sobs and a pair of arms wrapped around me, supporting me as my limbs became heavy, my body and mind spent from the stress or whatever trauma the spell had caused.
 I couldn’t say which, because I was pulled from consciousness into a black, dreamless sleep.

Eugene – I thought it was funny.
 Well since you two don’t appreciate my brand of humor I think I’m going to bed.
 Maybe I’ll get lucky and dream about that cheerleader.
 (Eugene exits the stage)
 Jim – I think he has a good idea, maybe the first he’s had in a long time.
 Johnny – Dreaming about boobies you mean?
 Jim – Yep.
 Johnny – Maybe I’ll get lucky and dream about them too.
 Jim – There’s a trick to dreaming about what-ever you like when-ever you like.
 Johnny – Yeah?

He looked over at Rodregas and shrugged.
 “We both have the power of the Infernal Realm in us.
 Is it easier for us to manage following the path of righteousness to let the power burn free or to take on the form of a greater sigil and bind the Infernal magic to a specific form?
 I think we must choose carefully.” Doi’van said and added, “For me the Bunei seems right.” Doi’van paused in that thoughtful way he had, considering all sides before taking action.
 “If it consumes my Infernal power I would gain its strengths.
 If I am lucky, what magic ability I have left will be mortal or Celestial in nature.
 The Bunei are creatures of magic, they are both great warriors and thinkers and magicians and are even known to sometimes help others.
 I cannot pass this chance up.
 I must see what will happen.” Rodregas nodded; they both knew they would not get this chance twice.
 Doi’van saw in the Bunei what Rodregas had felt in the lion in the main hall.

It was like being immersed in everything I'd loved only to have it evaporate when I went to grab my surroundings.
 "Hey, that's really pretty good.
 Is that a real place?"
 I nodded, hoping Alec would take the hint implied in my silence.
 I should have known better.
 "What's it called?"
 The name slid out of me almost of its own accord.
 "Monster Lake."
 Every single birthday I could remember had involved some kind of trip out to Monster Lake.
 Picnics had swapped off with treasure hunts and then been replaced by other activities depending on Dad's mood and my age.

 CM:  	One critic wrote, “Gardner seems content to wallow in his own past as if anyone else cared about it.”

You know, I love “Day in the Life.”  Shit.
 It doesn’t get much better than that, pop music-wise.
 “I read the news today oh boy” is just about the finest first line I’ve ever heard.
 I’d kill to have written that one line.
 But, does it compare to “April is the cruelest month?” Or “Turning and turning in the widening gyre?”  Or even, “Something there is that does not love a wall?”  No, of course not.
 And John would tell you the same thing.
 I’m not putting down The Beatles, hell, McCartney and Lennon are the greatest songwriting team of all time.
 No question.
 But, poets, naw, they ain’t that.
 Not in the strict meaning of the word.

Dieredon watched him, amazed just how young the man could still look in the moonlight.
 He was a year beyond forty, yet he commanded the entire Neldaren army.
 Publicly, he handled the weight wonderfully, but when prying eyes were gone, his all-too-human fear and doubt showed.
 When the man spoke again, his voice trembled.
 “I will not break my oaths.
 His Majesty asked I enforce his edict, and so I shall.”
 Dieredon nodded, the sparkle in his eyes fading.
 “I had hoped otherwise, but follow your oaths and your heart as you must.”
 The elf whistled.
 From the night sky came the sound of soft wing beats.

It was a small change of position, but somehow incredibly menacing.
 It wasn't until Vincent froze in place that I realized Isaac's shift had kept Vincent squarely between him and Alec.
 It was like watching a pair of wolves bringing down an elk.
 I'd seen gangs work together like this before, but it seemed strangely out of place in Sanctuary.
 I was positive there was going to be a fight after all, but then Vincent grabbed some poor freshman, shoved him into Isaac, and pushed his way downstairs as Isaac caught the human missile.
 As soon as Vincent was safely out of sight, everyone surged forward to congratulate Isaac on having saved Ben, and Ben on having not died.
 ** The near fight between Isaac and Vincent and then Alec's intervention seemed to be the buzz for the next two hours.
 It appeared that a lot of other people felt the same way that I did.
 Alec was plenty prickly and stuck up, but that was nothing compared to how much the average student hated Vincent, who seemed to delight in making everyone's life miserable.
 The teachers seemed curiously ignorant of everything.

I realized I must have been woolgathering for longer than I'd thought, and reached for my notebook.
 Only the bell should have rung by now, and it hadn't.
 I looked up at the clock and it confirmed that there was still at least a minute before class started.
 A slight rustle to my right brought my head around, and I looked up to find Alec smiling at me.
 I couldn't remember for sure if he'd ever smiled at me before, but I found myself suddenly positive he hadn't.
 I would have remembered such a strangely innocent expression.
 Brandon's smile was one of the most genuine I'd ever seen, the kind of thing that only the most deceptive person could possibly pull off and not mean.
 Alec's smile was like the first bloom on a flower, something so new, so unpracticed that there wasn't any possible way it was anything other than sincere.
 It made me tingle all over, and want to giggle like I was still six.
 Several seconds passed before I realized I'd been unconsciously returning his smile.

She eventually met a man who she was serious about, Dino.
 He would sometimes bring food we were not accustomed to eating, like steak.
 I had no memory of any man ever giving us a gift or anything of the sort before, but occasionally he would bring us a trinket to our mother’s delight.
 He was a big man with a dark complexion and jet-black hair and he would often talk on the phone in his native Greek.
 Thomas and I had never heard someone speak in a foreign language so it was intriguing.
 My mom soon married Dino and we officially had a stepfather.
 Shortly after they were married we moved north to Sacramento.
 It was a six-hour drive from where my grandparents and uncle lived.
 We said our goodbyes to our sobbing grandmother and to all our friends and entered a new chapter in our lives.
 I was in the fifth grade; Thomas was in sixth.

“Dire Beasts seek such places to lair,” answered Doi’van.
 “Whether their ancestry is Celestial or Infernal, they instinctively seek a place that has a higher level of magic energy.
 But they find ley lines like this irritating as much as we do, unless there is some way to smooth out its turbulence.
 This is especially true of pregnant females.
 The strongest dire animals are not just those of nearest descent, but also those who come to term in high magical environments.” Rodregas nodded, he had heard bits of this but he had not really thought about it.
 Doi’van stretched his hands up and up to an impressive height, and a smile spread across his face, the first one Rodregas had seen on the Hellborn face.
 It was good to see, though it was also a little scary as his teeth were more pointed than Rodregas was used to seeing.
 His teeth had more in common with the Dire Cats than himself or Imeralda.
 “Of course, I know this first hand as it is the same for us Hellborn.
 We will not grow strong if we do not spend much of our childhood in a place that is rich in magic.

“What part did Ahrqur play in this?” Aurelia asked.
 “Was he enlisted by Velixar?”
 Harruq shook his head.
 “Me and Qurrah killed him, then Velixar brought him back and sent him off to the king.
 It was very much unwilling on his part.
 That guy was me and Qurrah’s dad, you know that?
 We killed our own dad, and never even knew it while we did.”
 She frowned, and deep lines of exhaustion marred her beauty.
 “Tonight we need to have a serious talk,” she said.
 “For now, I’d prefer we speak of lighter things.”

I wrote a song, I kept, thinking.
 I wrote a damn good song.
 I was back, you know, back, but different.
 Different but the same.
 This is what I want everyone to understand.
 What I want to say—the difference is not a drama, the difference is a poem, a song, a way of looking at life, that’s slightly atilt, slightly askew, perhaps, but it’s all me, you know?
 It’s what I am.
 I am a songwriter.
 That was finding my soul.

After we were told to go to bed, we would hide behind the counter that blocked the table where they played cards.
 We could stay there late into the night and hear details of these shady lives.
 They all had odd nicknames.
 One man was called “The Painter” and I have no idea where the name came from but I did know that if they needed someone’s house “painted” that this man was going there to kill them.
 He was a hit man, plain and simple!
 Their conversations were graphic.
 One night my stepfather won a big poker hand that included a man’s car, a classic Bentley!
 This man was called the “Undertaker,” but I am not sure what he did.
 Maybe he really was an undertaker but I doubt it.
 Another man they called “The Banker,” and he really was a banker but he was crooked as a stick.

Marie gazed into his eyes for a moment.
 "I can't!"
 she whispered hoarsely.

 She turned and ran to her room.
 Rick hurried after her.
 "I'm sorry!
 Marie, I'm so sorry!"
 Her door was locked, so he knocked.

"No."
 He glanced at her.
 "I just wish I was the one you wanted most."
 She caught her breath, covering her mouth with her hand and running from the room.
 Rick hated himself for pushing her like that, but he couldn't seem to help it.
 He was desperate.
 He knew now that he could keep her here, but how could he do that when she wanted so much to go home?
 He ordered Chinese, and Marie came down just after it arrived.
 She saw the cartons and silently went to pour two glasses of tea.
 Rick slid his arms around her from behind.

I glanced backward.
 Paper fell to scatter on the floor.
 I surveyed the library, but it was practically empty.
 Someone on a higher level must have knocked the pages down.
 I bent over and read the closest document.
 It was an account from the northern clans.
 Despite my disbelief, I somehow managed to act quickly, stashing the papers in my shirt before attempting a casual exit to read them at home.
 I made it out of the library and almost to the gate when I noticed a dark figure behind Virden Day’s tree.
 It was Chevelle.
 He was speaking with Virden when he turned his head slowly toward me… and I was staring into his eyes again.

Continuous supplies of food are absolutely essential to the welfare of the population.
 Food prices are extremely sensitive to changes in the supply of foodstuffs.
 Even a small increase or decrease in supply can lead to a very wide fluctuation in prices.
 A bumper harvest can depress prices to the point of bankrupting large numbers of farmers.
 A poor harvest can send food prices soaring beyond the purchasing power of large numbers of people.
 Buffer stocks, subsidies and incentives are used to protect agriculture from sharp price fluctuations.
 Al though the principles of free trade argue that countries should produce only those items in which they possess a competitive advantage and procure the rest from overseas, few nations are willing to entrust their food supply entirely or even substantially to foreign parties.
 For decades Japan maintained trade barriers to keep the price of rice at more than six times the international level in order to protect and preserve domestic rice producers; the US government exports subsidized wheat; and the European Community sells subsidized milk powder and butter internationally at prices up to one-third below the domestic level.
 The debate over the legitimate role of government in protection of the agricultural economy is partially a question of timing.
 Market institutions and competitive strengths are normally built up over decades.

The bricks on the wall next to the door were cracked and set back in the wall, almost like they'd been hit with some kind of wrecking ball, and the concrete of the sidewalk had gouges crisscrossing its surface like some kind of abstract painting.
 "There's nothing to see here, kids.
 I want you to all disperse and go to your home rooms."
 The short, mostly bald man who'd ordered us all to leave was just visible through a gap in the crowd.
 He walked like an administrator, but I hadn't ever seen him before.
 "Who's that?"
 Brandon started just a little, like he'd been thinking of something else.
 "Mr. Rindell, the assistant principal."
 Now that my complete attention wasn't on the various destroyed bits of school property, I noticed how much whispering was going on.
 Most of it was too quiet to catch more than bits and pieces, but I heard more than one 'completely jacked up', and a few people wondering what could have caused that kind of destruction.

He squeezed her hand.
 "Don't worry, Marie.
 You'll get back sooner or later.
 And until you do, I'll take care of you.
 I promise."
 She went upstairs with him and said goodnight outside her bedroom door.
 But her heart began pounding with panic as she thought about the day she'd just spent in 2011.
 She'd worn trousers in town, and she'd embraced a man in public.
 And now she was spending the night alone with him in his house!
 Davis would have a fit if he ever found out she'd been to a speakeasy; he'd refuse to marry her if he found out what she'd done today.

The wolves do not follow the elves.
 The wolves protect them by choice.” “By choice?” “Yes.
 And I have seen them tear an elf apart as quickly as defend them.” I shivered.
 “Rhys and Rider were saved by the wolves once.
 They think the animals understand.
 They follow the wolves, you see.
 That is why they are here.” We topped the ridge, jagged rock and loose dirt shifting beneath our feet, and Ruby dropped the quiver by the edge before climbing down with a deftness I had yet to master.
 Steed, Anvil, and Grey greeted us before we resumed training.
 I tried to keep my mind off the wolves, off the reason we were training, off the encounter with Chevelle, off all of the terrible things it kept returning to, and I was grateful for the fog that clouded my thoughts.
 Though I wasn’t exactly winning matches, I was getting better.

In a sense, the human urge for violence has neither increased nor decreased.
 It has simply shifted the field of expression from confrontation between nation states to confrontation between powerful governments and disenchanted, disenfranchised groups of individuals who respond to the application of superior power by nation states with the application of indiscriminate violence against the public-at-large.
 Terrorism thrives in the absence of effective democratic institutions to give voice to the will of its citizens.
 At the same time, lifting the tyranny of state terrorism has itself become the occasion in some instances for an outburst of violence by long suppressed groups.
 Eradication of terrorism is possible, but it demands a comprehensive and integrated approach and concerted, collective action.
 The commercialization of the arms trade – which benefits some countries economically at the expense of the security of all nations – must be subject to rigorous monitoring and control by international agencies.
 Vested economic interests that thrive on conflict must be placed under UN surveillance and regulation.
 International institutions must be strengthened to eradicate arms smuggling, narcotics, offshore money laundering and other criminal activities that serve as seedbeds and instruments for terrorism.
 However, no final solution to the problem of terrorism can be arrived at by force alone.
 While terrorism is frequently attributed to religion and ideology, it sprouts and thrives most readily among populations that lack opportunities for gainful employment and economic development.

Some say she works in television.
 Some say she went back to perdition from whence she came.
 But it was in L.A. that Buddy transformed himself into a folk artist, a singer/songwriter with a heart on his sleeve and an ace up it.
 He was as mellow as yellow, as smooth as California sunshine.
 And as empty as a bird’s nest in December.
 His two albums, “I Was a Child When Smaller,” and “Rain and other Distractions,” were mega-sellers.
 Buddy made it.
 He made it big.
 For a price, yes.
 Those last songs, dripping with feigned self-pity, seem apocalyptic in retrospect.

That was why he’d been foolish enough to ask Kim to marry him, he now realized.
 He was much more cautious now.
 In fact, Ted said he’d gone to the opposite extreme.
 But he’d finally realized that there were worse things than being lonely.
 He wouldn’t have been lonely if he’d married Kim or Gina or Sabrina, but he wouldn’t have been happy.
 Even sex was no longer enough to motivate him to get into a relationship like those.
 He wanted someone he could be completely at ease with.
 He wanted someone he could relax with when he came home from work, not someone he had to work to please.
 All his married buddies told him he was dreaming, that marriage was a strain, a series of trade-offs.
 But he couldn’t help hoping there was something better than that.

“I was just, um, I never got a chance to thank you.” Harruq felt his face flush.
 This was the most awful thing he had ever done.
 He’d prefer to face a dragon in unarmed combat.
 He’d have better odds surviving, too, based on Aurelia’s cold, steeled look.
 “You came all the way out here to thank me?
 Hardly sounds like an orcish thing to do.”
 One would not have thought gray skin could turn so red, but it did.
 “Well, I still want to repay you.” Harruq held out a small bag containing copper coins.
 “It’s all I have.
 Please, take it.”

CHAPTER 8 THE TEST BEFORE THE TEST
 Over the next few weeks Rodregas, Doi’van and Imeralda fell into a regular routine.
 It quickly became clear that while Imeralda might not be a trained mage, she was far more knowledgeable than Doi’van or Rodregas in magic.
 So, while Rodregas often led the training in the morning, she led during the afternoon.
 Rodregas thought Doi’van was learning far more quickly than any of the squires that he had trained with as a teenager.
 Doi’van looked like a daemonic nightmare, and he clearly loved to test his strength in battle, but he was an amazingly quick learner both with the forms and with the books.
 Even though Doi’van could not read, Rodregas would read him some of the Grimoires, since they were the only books they had.
 His insights and questions were insightful, and Rodregas realized that Doi’van’s intellect was greater than his own.
 Two weeks into the routine the three were starting to get into the rhythm; they had moved into the old house and for not having a roof, it was pretty comfortable.
 Though they had all claimed rooms of their own, they were all still sleeping in the living room, partly because of the fire they kept there and partly for the company.

She attended no church but disdained atheists.
 Lord of the Flies she called propaganda by which teachers could argue the superiority of adults.
 Catcher in the Rye she applauded because Holden Caulfield appreciated jazz and was nearly as cynical as herself.
 She dismissed Nietzsche as a syphilitic blowhard.
 While we gabbed, Richard might eye us as though he had something to say.
 But the moment would pass, and he would turn back to gawk at the tube until Sylvia ordered him to fetch her cigarettes, or made him stand still while she straightened his tie, or checked to see that he had zipped all the way.
 Observing them made us recommit ourselves to becoming supermen.
 One Friday night, I arrived just as they were leaving for a jazz club.
 Before climbing into Richard’s car, Sylvia commanded me, “If you brought any liquor, Kenneth, go away.” I agreed and waited until they drove off before scooping a pint of bourbon and a bottle of ginger ale out of my Chevrolet’s trunk.
 I wanted to get numb.

“I think that if I try to stand up I'll either pass out or throw up.” “Will you be okay flying?” Emily asked.
 “What?” I asked.
 “Flying?
 What do you mean 'flying', Emily?” “Our new dragon friend offered to fly us out of the woods region and towards more of the mountains.
 I said yes, of course, because I don't want to walk the whole way there,” she explained and walked towards the dragon.
 “I guess...” Seth said and stood up.
 He paled and started to sway.
 Jason grabbed his shoulder to steady him.
 “Thanks Jason,” he panted.
 “Take it easy, Seth.

“We met after work, just past sundown, and I led him straight to Qurrah, who cast a spell on Perry then, kind of like you did with the guards.
 He shouted until his head turned purple but made no sound for the effort.
 Then Qurrah cast another spell that made him go all tough and rigid.
 Felt like I was holding a stick.
 We took him inside and put him on the floor.
 “He wasn’t supposed to die,” Harruq said, staring right into Aurelia’s eyes so she would know he spoke the truth.
 “We didn’t mean to have what happened happen, but well…‌Qurrah put a bunch of meat on Perry’s face.
 It was old and rancid.
 Poor guy still had to keep smelling it though, and then Qurrah cast his spell.
 “The meat started bubbling and turning watery.

 He squeezed her hand.
 "Just think about it, OK?"
 She nodded.

 Davis would never let her go to a speakeasy, much less to Hollywood.

She fetched a Bible from her cubby and read aloud, “Her lips drip honey, but in the end she is a bitter fruit.
 Her steps lead straight to the grave.” Reba laughed and sat in the chair between Cliff and me.
 She arched her back so her breasts swelled.
 “Helga, last night I took your advice.
 I said, ‘God, help me out here.
 Don’t let temptation lure me down to the Inn Spot again.’” Helga beamed, and leaned across the table.
 “You stayed home?
 Tell me you stayed home?” “Well, I stayed home all right, but that’s not the whole story.
 You see, the devil came for me.” “No.” Helga covered her face with both hands and peeked out.
 “Yes ma’am.

When I finally caught up with her she'd recovered enough to complain, but there was a breathless nature to her voice that told me she wouldn't be skipping the math lab for a little while.
 I made non-committal noises as we waited in line, all the while scanning the cafeteria for two faces.
 Actually, scanning wasn't the right word for it.
 I just kind of looked that way and instantly found my eyes drawn to Brandon.
 He was surrounded by people, mostly female, all attractive.
 Taking in all of those lithe, tan bodies, I suddenly felt incredibly inferior.
 All of the impending skin cancer deaths suddenly didn't seem quite so important.
 I looked away before anyone could see me staring.
 Britney was still looking longingly at a pile of fries.
 When I looked up again Brandon was looking back at me with a smile that communicated all kinds of things I'd always thought you needed words for.

A complete listing of essential institutions, small and large, should be compiled, based on the experience of other nations, and plans drawn up for introducing them.
 Thus far, the development of social organizations, like the development of technologies, has been partial, piecemeal and sectoral, leaving large gaps between parallel and interrelated activities and institutions.
 This is especially evident at the international level where the organization of the collective social life of humanity is rudimentary and fragmentary, though far more complete than it was a few decades ago.
 In spite of the phenomenal growth in global communications, transportation, commerce, finance and tourism, it is still more difficult to carry out most activities internationally than it is domestically, because the international activities are not as well organized.
 For instance, transfer of technology still involves a process that is largely trial and error.
 Firms in developing countries seeking to acquire the best available technology for importation or acquisition have to search at considerable expenditure of time and money to discover what is available within their own country as well as overseas.
 The process of identifying and commercially transferring technology can be vastly simplified and accelerated by the establishment of international technology transfer corporations, sponsored by UN agencies such as UNESCO and UNIDO, specializing in all major fields of technology.
 These corporations should be operated on a commercial, for-profit basis, though governments of developing countries could become shareholders in order to promote their formation.
 Each corporation could undertake a detailed study of available technologies in its field and offer to assist corporate customers in developing countries in selecting the most appropriate technology to meet their needs.
 The corporations could also acquire the rights to important technologies with large-scale applications and then market them widely.

I turned back around to see Kojas slash Seth across the stomach.
 That’s when I screamed.
 Seth fell to his knees, holding his midsection.
 His sword fell out of his grip and to the ground.
 Kojas grinned in triumph and kicked Seth to the ground.
 I screamed again, when he didn’t move.
 “At last,” Kojas breathed.
 “Monster!” I cried.
 “You’re a monster!” He didn’t answer me.
 I looked up the hill to see a bunch of faery jerks running down the hill towards us.

I couldn't breathe until the dust settled, and Alec rolled back up to his feet, dripping blood from a large gash in his side.
 Dominic heard my sudden gasp and reached over to reassure me.
 "He's okay.
 We heal fast, and he heals faster than most."
 "So this isn't normal?"
 Dom shook her head again.
 "No, in most packs, any confrontation ends in violence.
 Generally there are a whole host of dominants who want to become the alpha.
 This would usually turn into a real dominance fight, with the other two doing their very best to kill him before turning on each other to fight over the spoils."
 "That's terrible."

Alec smiled and reached over to the backpack as he sat up.
 I let him pull me up and then felt my face freeze as he pulled out one of the largest velvet boxes I'd ever seen.
 "Alec, no."
 "It wasn't that expensive and you've already told me I could."
 "I didn't think you'd have something already ready and waiting to ambush me with.
 I thought I'd at least have a few days to prepare myself."
 He smiled again and I gingerly held my hand out.
 The green velvet lid swung up to reveal the most delicate necklace I'd ever seen.
 It was a thin glass heart set inside a slightly larger heart.
 "I saw it when I was in Virginia last week for business and thought of you."

"Ms. Bellarose, please move up to Ms. Paige's old seat."
 Alec politely collected his note and led me to our seats.
 Any enjoyment I'd just experienced as a result of seeing one of my least-favorite teachers put in her place quickly soured as she started the class and launched into her usual barrage of questions designed to demonstrate my stupidity.
 Alec had apparently gotten under her skin even more than I'd realized.
 She abandoned her usual practice of stopping once I missed my first question, and instead continued to grill me, her smile growing each time I failed to answer something correctly.
 My earlier commitment to rededicate myself to school notwithstanding, the weekend hadn't exactly been conducive to mastering the intricacies of our latest subject.
 Her smile was wide indeed by the time the bell finally released me to flee in defeat and embarrassment.
 Alec paced me all the way back to my locker.
 "Is that normal for her?"
 I started to laugh, only to cut the motion short as I realized there was a better than even chance I'd end up crying instead.

We were talked about but you had to be part of the cognoscenti, the insiders.
 I hated this, if I was aware of it—I really don’t remember.
 Keep in mind, all I wanted to do was play my guitar and write songs.
 And I was writing at an astonishing clip and artists were picking up on it, and, well, the money started coming in.
 See, in a way, I was fortunate.
 I never had to sack groceries at Piggly Wiggly or teach school, or cut lawns.
 Writing songs, I learned early, brought in the bucks.
 And a lot of the talent coming out of Nashville, well, a lot of those guys were singing my stuff.
 See, at that time, everyone wanted to play and sing, but not everyone could write.
 So I wrote.

God is me, in me, you know?
 That’s what she’s saying.
 That’s what she’s always been saying, but people couldn’t hear her, for whatever reason.
 They wouldn’t listen.
 Just like I say in “Burn my Bridge”, you know?
 “There’s a black and white photograph/On my finger is a tiny bird.”  You know?
 It’s like they can’t hear me now, after they all were so intent on being Black Lung acolytes, or whatever.
 Now, these same cats, these same sycophants and hangers-on, they’re up there, pronouncing on me, on Lor, on my new stuff as if I’m not a human being, too.
 As if I can’t be hurt, am impregnable, a force instead of a feeling, bleeding child, you know?
 Like we all are.

During the fairs that most rural areas had fighting contests were common, but they were always matches of wrestling or bare knuckle fighting.
 The only weapons allowed the local workers were the staff and sometimes the bow.
 Rodregas had always regarded the staff as a primitive weapon which no true warrior would bother with, but to watch Doi’van with it was breathtaking.
 The staff whirled around him a blur, and the length of the weapon made full use of his height and size.
 But he also had complete control of the weapon as he highlighted that morning by whizzing past Rodregas’ clumsy blocks and bruising every part of his body until even the smallest movement hurt.
 Rodregas was used to being better trained than others, but with the staff he was starting from scratch; even holding it properly was new to him.
 Doi’van showed him to keep one hand at the center of the staff and one hand between the center and the end.
 One always gripped the staff in thirds.
 When it was held horizontally in front, the right palm faced away from the body and the left hand faced the body, enabling the staff to rotate.
 The power for generated strikes was held by the backhand pulling the staff, while the front hand was used for guidance.

The establishment of a new type of institution – the township and village industries – in China, and the unique system for linking them with scientific institutions, made possible the country’s phenomenal achievements in rural enterprise and employment generation.
 These enterprises now represent 16.5 per cent of all businesses in China and employ 22 per cent of the workforce.
 Institutional innovations of this type are possible in every state and every country.
 A comparative study of institutions and systems in more and less developed regions and countries for every major sector will make it possible to construct accurate scales and reliable road maps for more rapid development.
 In the countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, the social institutions that served under the centralized command system need to be transformed out of recognition, or entirely replaced, in order to support a market-oriented system.
 Attempts at economic reform that focus primarily on changing laws and public policy without creating the necessary institutional infrastructure cannot succeed.
 Thousands of systems that have been fashioned by human resourcefulness are needed to support economic activity in different fields.
 The system of warehouse receipts enables American grain traders to purchase unseen crops with full confidence in their quality.
 The absence of this simple system retards trade on the recently established commodity markets in Russia and other CIS countries.
 A complete listing of essential institutions, small and large, should be compiled, based on the experience of other nations, and plans drawn up for introducing them.

But before I could protest, a black rock hurtled toward me.
 My hand jerked up automatically to swat it away but my arm hit an invisible wall.
 The rock slammed into my face.
 I was fairly certain my nose was bleeding from the impact.
 I tried to slow my horse but no longer had control of him.
 “Again,” Chevelle warned.
 The rock was coming for me a second time.
 I tried to duck out of the way but the wall was there once more, blocking me from moving.
 I cursed as the stone glanced off my cheek.
 “This isn’t fair,” I complained.

I had fallen asleep looking at my mother’s pendant, trying to remember her, and somehow combined it with the disaster I had read of the northern clans.
 It was only a dream.
 Shaken, I sat up, struggling to collect myself.
 I reached up to remove the pendant from the hook and squeezed it tight in my fist.
 It felt good, like a connection, and I slid the leather chain over my head, pulling the pendant down to rest on my chest.
 It felt right there and I knew I should have been wearing it all along.
 As I let go, I realized I’d gotten blood on my hands, so I headed to the hall and poured water from the pitcher into a ceramic basin.
 Staring into the mirror was not my favorite pastime.
 It mostly made my head hurt.
 But I had to clean the blood from my face and straighten the nest of hair on my head.

He was unshaven and looked the part of a vagrant.
 We had a moment of eye contact and he had no expression as if he didn’t know me at all.
 It was a slight reassurance but I still wondered where the rest of them were and how they would get to me quick if things went to Hell.
 I received another call from the officer and he had me speak so they could tune in the wire.
 He said that they needed to occasionally check the wire—from time to time I should say something to reassure them that they’d end up with a quality recording of the deal.
 The crack-berry rang and it was Ashley.
 She said her friend was reluctant to come to where I was because I was in a county where they were tough on crime and she wanted me to drive a couple of miles away and meet them at a grocery store.
 I told her again that I didn’t have much time and it was already past twenty minutes.
 The deal would happen where I was or it wouldn’t happen, period!
 I told her to get her shit together or I was leaving.

Is it okay if you just start at the same time you did last night?"
 She accepted my nod at face value, but then paused in the act of turning away.
 "Is there anything wrong?
 You seemed awfully distracted in class today."
 My headshake wasn't very convincing.
 I'd known it wouldn't be, but couldn't manage anything more.
 It was a relief when she chose not to press for more information.
 By the time people started trickling out and my shift started, I'd spent plenty of time watching Britney pout, and very little time actually working on my homework.
 I think it was really starting to sink in that she wasn't going to be able to get out of continuing to spend most of her afternoons here.
 Albert, Mrs. Campbell, and the other tutor all waved goodbye as they left.

Presents, eggnog and the Christmas story.
 Usually Dad made us breakfast Christmas morning and then we'd drive out of the city later in the day and go sledding.
 I hadn't thought about what it would be like this year."
 Alec nodded like he'd just checked a box off on some kind of mental list.
 "So snow's always been a pretty key ingredient sounds like."
 "I guess.
 It hadn't really sunk in that we wouldn't be getting any of that this year.
 A month ago I would have thought that was a good thing, that it would be one less thing to remind me of Dad and Cindi.
 I think I might actually miss it this year though."
 I rested my head against Alec's shoulder.

Just after 7:00 Rick drove onto his own little bit of Boston in the Back Bay.
 He'd had his house built on a beautiful acre that was located on the southeast edge of the area inhabited by Boston's elite.
 Real estate prices there were outrageous, but Rick, with his connections and eye for property, had gotten this parcel for next to nothing.
 It was only a few blocks from the downtown area and considered too close for comfort by true members of the upper class.
 But for Rick it was perfect.
 Both his office and his neighbors were close but not too close, and he had a beautiful lawn in the front and a large patio and flower garden in the back.
 Rick smiled as he walked into his kitchen, loosening his tie.
 Lauri moaned every time she walked into the garden.
 What a waste, she always sighed, looking at him with reproach.
 A woman would love having that garden, but what did a man know about flowers?

 We all know that we picked the right four, but it would be a shame if something happened to all of you before you could complete your goal.” That got my attention.
 “You know how we became half-lings?
 You know who attacked us that day?” “I've said too much already,” she said and backed up.
 “I must go.” “Wait!” I called.
 “Wait; tell me what's going on!
 Tell me what we're supposed to do!” But she was already gone.
 *** I opened my eyes and the cold of the morning bit at my cheeks.
 Seth was fast asleep next to me, his blue hair covering half his face.

“When can’t you use sarcasm?” I asked loudly.
 He didn’t reply to me because he had spotted Emily.
 She was slowly backing up with her palms out.
 Fire danced from her fingertips and twisted towards the troll and frost beast.
 The beast breathed and ice sprayed from its mouth.
 Emily moved her hand over and the ice evaporated into mist.
 She was holding up fine but I didn’t know how much longer.
 I strung my bow and released an arrow.
 It pierced the frost beast’s pelt and it fell to the ground.
 Emily turned to me with huge, confused eyes.

“Buddy Gardner was a gentleman in a jerk business,” Officer Milton remembers.
 This mildness, this Southern gentleman perception, follows Buddy to this day.
 It’s hard to find someone to speak ill of him, even those he later abandoned or stepped on on his way to the top.
 He is often compared to courtly though dipsomaniacal photographer Bill Eggleston, a friend of Buddy’s from those acme days.
 The cover photograph of Black Lung’s Pepper Records album, Turntable Poison, is an unaccredited Eggleston photograph.
 (It is, of course, a weathered Sinclair sign, imbued with the enchantment Mr. Eggleston brought to all his work, a divergence quite inexplicable.)
 Buddy was loved, revered.
 He was not held to the same rules as everyone else.
 So it goes with the great.
 And when Buddy started using drugs, mixing bennies, reds and laxatives in dangerous quantities, no one was there to question him.

I managed some kind of reply, one that might've even been witty, but which apparently didn't manage to cover up the fact I wasn't really okay.
 We drove in silence the rest of the way into town, and by the time we turned into the school parking lot I'd come back to myself enough to be desperately looking for something else to say.
 I needed something cool enough Brandon wouldn't write me off as a lost cause.
 Wish-granting fairies somewhere were working overtime, because as Brandon turned off the engine, I saw a mob of people over by one of the smaller entrances to the school.
 "Wow, I wonder what's going on over there."
 We were both out of the car now, and it seemed the most natural thing in the world to grab Brandon's arm and tug him over to the crowd.
 It wasn't until I felt the iron-hard muscles under my now-tingling hand that I realized what I'd done.
 I felt a surge of heat wash over my face and neck.
 Brandon for once didn't have an easy comeback to defuse the awkwardness.
 If anything he looked slightly uncomfortable himself.

“I’m sorry.”
 She ended his pain with a small lance of ice through his forehead.
 “Thank you for your aid,” one of the elves said.
 “We must fall back to the forest.
 If they chase us there, it will be suicide.”
 “We will not have to fall back so far,” Felewen disagreed.
 “They have scattered about our town.
 Their numbers mean nothing now.
 Besides,” she grinned, “we have Aurelia Thyne.”
 Both bowed politely.

Each side was twisted metal that ended in the ground.
 In the center, two pieces spun together and ended holding a pulsing, black crystal.
 You should have been able to look right through the archway but there seemed to be a sheet of transparent black glass in the way.
 “This is the door to Igneeria,” the dwarf pronounced proudly.
 I fought the urge to say, “No duh!” Jason looked up, mesmerized.
 “Epic.” “Epic?” Seth scoffed.
 “That’s all you can say?
 This,” he motioned to the dark archway, “can't be described by one word.” I smiled to myself.
 The old Seth seemed to be coming back, which was great.
 I was getting really tired of quiet, watching Seth.

It was known to be very difficult to affect Dire beasts with magic, and his success had shown his power and accomplishment as a mage.
 Rodregas had regretted not being on duty when the Dire Cats were staked out on the roof.
 Rodregas had heard from the other guards that the cats were in heat, and as Ravenhurr had hoped, a Celestial Lion had sensed their presence while the lion was out during the full moon with the Wilde Hunt, and the great lion had spent the last few nights doing his best to impregnate both of the female beasts.
 The whole keep could hear the wild rutting going on.
 Ravenhurr then had goats released on the roof and the Celestial Lion had gorged himself on them when he had finished rutting.
 The well-satisfied beast lay limp, sleeping, confident in his celestial power, and oblivious to his surroundings.
 He lied unbound, as required by the ceremony.
 Rodregas assumed some subtle magic had been used to influence the beast to sleep in just the right spot.
 The unlikely success of having an actual celestial animal as part of the ceremony had put Ravenhurr into an unusually good mood.
 Using one of the Dire Cats in the ceremony would have been good, but an actual Celestial animal would provide much more power.

Glitter was in the air before I could stop her.
 By the time Chevelle returned, I was loopy with it.
 He and Ruby sat facing me.
 She must have filled him in on my problem.
 I resisted the urge to touch him.
 I always wanted to touch him.
 “Frey,” Chevelle began in a measured tone.
 I cut him off, trying to sound calm.
 “What happened?” “It would seem the council has attacked us.” I was too numb to draw in the quick breath I expected.
 My cheeks tingled.

He's in no kind of way needing yet more to fret about.
 Just let me catch my breath and I'll be as right as ever."
 Several minutes later, once the renewed bout of coughing had subsided, Mallory looked back up at me with wan features.
 "How did it happen?
 What brought things between Brandon and our Alec to a head?"
 "It was my fault.
 I'd been dating Brandon, and we went to a party.
 Only while we were there he tried to do things I wasn't comfortable with.
 When I told him no, he--they--threw me out and told me to find my own way home."
 It was harder to relate the story than I'd expected, but Mallory's cluck of disapproval over Brandon's actions helped a little.

The face that'd look back out of the glass would look almost more like hers than mine.
 Shoulder-length blond hair and blue eyes still seemed to be all the rage, but mine were ruined by pale skin that burned instead of tanning, and a build that had retained its baby fat long after most of the other girls had started slimming down.
 Those extra inches had evaporated recently, but of course it couldn't be a cause for celebration.
 When Mom surfaced enough to notice how much weight I'd lost, she worried I was developing an eating disorder.
 She couldn't seem to understand that I hated the new me more than she did.
 Cindi was the skinny one.
 I'd tried to make myself eat enough to fill back out, but I'd had a hard time remembering meals lately.
 It was easier to just cinch my pants up a little and avoid mirrors.
 Even when I did remember, the calories in didn't seem quite able to keep up with the calories my body routinely burned up.
 I guess panic attacks are harder on your system than most people realize.

I was an asshole.
 It was my asshole period.
 One of them.
 (laughs)  One of them.
 Sorry, baby.
 Carol Warner, I met at a school dance, where Black Lung played.
 It was in the school cafeteria—Jesus, those gigs, you gotta love ‘em, right?
 I mean, looking back, you gotta love that shit.
 Girls and boys rubbing against each other, hormones exploding all over the room, while we grind away at some awful cover song like “One is the Loneliest Number.”  Occasionally slipping in one of our originals which is met with a silence like we farted in church.
 (laughs)  It was a kick.

“Your brother is dead,” one elf said.
 “Gaelwren waited for your departure.
 He will not find it difficult killing a wounded dog.”
 The anger inside Harruq consumed him entirely.
 He charged the elf, abandoning any hint of precaution.
 He slammed his blades down with all his might.
 The elf blocked once, twice, then three times, wincing each time he did.
 Then the other elf was behind Harruq, stabbing at his back.
 While mad with rage, Harruq still knew very well where his opponents were.
 He spun, avoiding the thrust, and then trapped his assailant’s arm with his elbow.

"All right."
 She closed her eyes and began thinking about Davis and how it felt to dance with him.
 She thought about her mother and father and brother and how they'd laughed and talked at meals before her brother had been disowned.
 She thought about Tom and the speakeasy.
 She opened her eyes to see Rick watching her anxiously.
 She swallowed.
 "I'm still here."
 "I'm sorry."
 "Maybe I should go walk in the garden.
 That's how I got here, so that's probably the best way to get back."

_A gang of children slept on a stack of hay.
 They were filthy, scrawny, and diseased.
 A small rat crept near, its mouth covered with flecks of white foam.
 When close enough, it latched onto the hand of the biggest child, who awoke screaming.
 Time distorted so that days passed as that scream lingered.
 His face paled, his mouth foamed, and then he died, screaming, still screaming._
 _The vision ended.
 Velixar opened his eyes._
 “What is it that I saw?” he asked.
 “The second time I ever killed,” Qurrah said.

She would accuse me, I was sure.
 Somehow, Evelyn would make this my fault.
 “Well?” Fannie hissed, leaning over to glare at me.
 I jerked back to reality, no idea what she’d been saying.
 “Where were you during the commotion?” she repeated.
 “I’d think if you were at Junnie’s, you’d have known all about it.
 Why didn’t you warn me?” My mouth opened and closed.
 “Well,” I said, “Junnie sent me home early because I learned a spell.” Fannie looked incredulous, so I backpedaled.
 “Well, not a spell, but I grew a… flower.
 And then I was so excited I was going to run home and tell you… but I took the back way and then…” I swallowed.

They were so careful not to cross paths, it was possible this was a true first, but seeing them now there was no way to get around the fact that Brandon was at least two inches taller, as well as being broader and more muscular.
 I'd seen Alec shirtless, and he had the incredible physique of a swimsuit model, but Brandon's was that of a professional body builder.
 Either of them dwarfed me, but Brandon gave off an air of menace that even Alec's controlled power couldn't offset.
 Brandon's next few words came out in a low growl that I couldn't make out, and then he slowly backed away from Alec before he and the rest of his pack disappeared from sight.
 I finished processing everything about the time Alec turned and walked back.
 I opened my mouth to protest, but he shook his head at me as we all fell into formation around him.
 From what little I knew about Alec's pack, it wasn't uncommon for them to spend time together without the kind of chest-beating byplay that was so much a part of Brandon's group, but our lunch table was even more subdued than I'd expected.
 Faced with an almost complete lack of conversation, I didn't have the courage to ask some of the questions on my mind.
 It wasn't until I'd followed Isaac to my history class that I finally worked up the nerve to find out more of what was going on.
 Once the substitute had called roll, and then more or less turned the class loose for a 'group study session', I turned to Isaac and whispered my first question.

Marie frowned.
 He always apologized for shouting at her, but that hadn't stopped him from shouting at her again.
 He'd apologized for hurting her arm, but that hadn't stopped him from hurting her with his kiss.
 Would her life with him be like that?
 A series of angry words or painful grasps or bruising kisses followed by apologies?
 She was still wrestling with that question when she realized that the fog had lifted and she was still in 2011.
 Dejected, she went back to Rick.
 "It didn't work."
 He stood up, taking her hands.
 "I'm sorry, Marie."

I hadn’t slept, and I knew I would have to sneak a nap in at some point, but I had priorities.
 It might be my last opportunity for a real bath.
 And lovely soaps.
 I sat with Steed for a while after I’d bathed.
 He was reclined on the bench, his feet propped on a low table.
 He didn’t seem as excited as Ruby had been about our coming trip, so I asked him about it.
 “I’m just riding the wind, Frey.” “Oh, so you don’t know where we’re going either?” He laughed.
 “No, I know where we are going.
 It’s only that I don’t know where we’ll end up.” I didn’t know what was going to happen either.
 I thought of the tracker and realized what a good distraction the book had been.

Once the police get involved, the school board has to expel.
 That’s policy.
 Otherwise, they won’t usually expel, for fear a parent will sue them.
 “Eric and Kenny are good boys, I know.
 If I can do anything for them, I will.
 Now, you two, please go learn something.”
 A Bigger Change
 Since Kenny’s dad was football coach across town at Coronado High School, Kenny transferred there and would graduate, and meanwhile bat leadoff on their baseball team.
 Eric became a lot boy at a Lemon Grove Ford, a ten minute walk from Sylvia’s house.
 The next couple of weeks, I only saw Eric on Sundays, his day off, and when I stopped by in the evenings, I would find him lying on his bed, reading.

All he hears, I hear.
 His thoughts, dreams, and nightmares are available to me, hidden behind locked doors to which I now hold the key.”
 Again, Qurrah lusted for such power and control.
 Velixar smiled, clearly seeing the desire the half-orc hid behind his eyes.
 “One day you will hold such control.
 For now, be content with what I have taught you.”
 Qurrah gave a soft laugh and then nodded.
 “I believe that shall suffice.”
 Harruq did not know why, but the short exchange sent chills running to the pit of his stomach.

Aurelia had heard enough.
 She knew their roles, the balance and position of their hearts.
 It was absurd, poor souls without a home, family, or position to be speaking of power and obligation.
 Her hatred of their unknown master grew.
 He was a puppet-master, and her dear friend was one of his puppets.
 If they still doubted, even for a moment, perhaps she could save them.
 Perhaps there was still time to pull them from the necromancer’s cold fingers.
 Aurelia turned and ran for the forest.
 Dieredon had not known of her spying, but she would tell him everything.
 If there was any hope, it was in his skill with blade and bow.

“A second out of respect.” He drew a third.
 The guard captain charged, his shield leading.
 While his upper body was covered, nothing stopped the arrow from flying underneath and piercing through the metal greaves protecting his shins.
 Antonil stumbled, pain flaring up his right leg.
 He forced himself to continue running.
 If he could close the gap, the bow would prove no match for his longsword.
 Another arrow struck an inch from his left foot.
 His leg was aflame, yet he continued to charge, pulling back his shield so his sword could lash out.
 But the elf was not close enough, and he was more skilled with a bow than in just firing arrows.
 He snapped the wood up, cracking Antonil across the bottom of his hand, which held firm to his blade.

Luckily, the kitchen drudge had locked herself in the kitchen quarters.
 Rodregas then went back to the dungeon level and opened the opposite door and then the Dire Cats’ prison door and watched.
 He had expected them to either bolt for it or stay in the “safety” of their room.
 Instead they both casually got up and walked out, as if they were guests in a fancy inn, with all the time in the world.
 As they walked out the door both cats gave him a casual glance as he held the two doors firmly closed together bracing for the weight if they threw themselves at the doors, but they just walked by and headed up the stairs.
 He wanted to follow, but Rodregas held himself back patiently waiting until it was safe.
 They might look like lions, but he knew they were smarter than any beast, and they could be setting him up.
 Finally after waiting what seemed like forever, but was probably only about twenty minutes, Rodregas slowly made his way back up through the keep.
 When he poked his head out the entrance there was no sign of Dire Cats or chickens, but he did note a few stray feathers in the courtyard.
 Other than a few alarmed sounds from the chicken coop, it was surprisingly quiet.

We'd moved the beds and most of the other heavy items in earlier, which helped explain my exhaustion, but that didn't make the pile of remaining items in the back of the truck any less foreboding.
 I decided to take the easy way out, and picked up a couple of blanket-wrapped mirrors.
 I didn't unwrap either of them.
 That was dangerous too.
 The face that'd look back out of the glass would look almost more like hers than mine.
 Shoulder-length blond hair and blue eyes still seemed to be all the rage, but mine were ruined by pale skin that burned instead of tanning, and a build that had retained its baby fat long after most of the other girls had started slimming down.

Alec was gone when I looked back.
 Only the slight sway of my curtains gave evidence he'd just casually jumped out of my second-story window.
 I heard Mom's equipment bags hit the floor one after another.
 The sound of her tromping up the stairs finally roused me from my state of shock.
 "I'm in my room, Mom."
 Apparently the sound of my voice was at least slightly reassuring, she was only a little wild-eyed by the time she opened the door and stuck her head in my room.
 "Oh, there you are, dear.
 I was worried you were gone."
 I forced a chuckle.
 "Please, Mom.

I kept walking, not necessarily steering closer to the three-quarter wall the boy was leaning against, but also being very careful not to go out of my way to stay further away from them either.
 As I got close to the pair, a little more of the boy became visible, reaffirming my impression that he wasn't happy to be talking to her.
 His shoulders looked unnaturally tight and he was shaking his head slowly from side to side.
 Locked as I was into my course, I couldn't help but hear them both as I got closer.
 "I can't do this, Jasmin.
 I've been meaning to tell you for a while, but I was afraid of how you'd react."
 I half stumbled at the raw pain in his voice.
 While I was still trying to recover my balance, Jasmin looked up at me, and the force of her glare almost made me fall over my feet again.
 I'd seen plenty of girls try and warn off potential competition, but I'd never seen an expression that intense.
 Despite my earlier resolve, I couldn't help myself.

“Since you’re apparently not ready to retire for the evening, I suppose we will resume your training,” Chevelle said.
 I sighed.
 “Ooh, let me!” Ruby shouted.
 Chevelle gave her a doubtful look and then glanced at me, apparently deciding I deserved it.
 He nodded once and walked toward the rock ledge.
 Ruby bounced from foot to foot, celebrating her victory.
 As Chevelle moved past Anvil and Grey, they turned to follow him.
 The silver-haired elves and their dogs were nowhere in sight.
 My gaze caught Steed, who was watching me.
 I always forgot how strikingly handsome he was until I looked right at him.

I am unable to see in the tinted windows of the car but I am certain they can see me; I stare back as if to say, “Is that you?” They are obviously aware that I am there, alone and awaiting their arrival.
 The car slowly pulls away after taking a good look at me.
 I lose sight of them, as they seem to be going towards the opposite end of the parking lot.
 I assume they will pull around after checking out the surroundings but instead my crack-berry rings within seconds.
 It is Ashley and she is trying to move me to a Starbucks that is on the other side of the same parking lot.
 I resist and ask her if that was her that stopped next to me in the red Dodge Charger.
 She says it was but she would rather meet at the Starbucks where there are some people around.
 I tell her to just come to my truck and let’s get this deal done.
 Ashley states she is suspicious that I won’t drive a hundred yards to meet her.
 I make a judgment call that I know will not make the undercover narcotics team happy but she is right, what is my great reason justifying not driving a short distance?

 Jim – Did I miss something?

 Stupid practical jokes.

Prognosis for Employment in the Twenty-First Century
 Although it is difficult to make reliable employment projections based on past trends, we can say some things with a fair degree of certainty.
 In order to provide employment for every job seeker, the world needs to create approximately one billion new jobs during the next decade.
 This will require a job growth rate of more than 4 per cent per year compared to the less than 3 per cent achieved during the 1980s.
 About 95 per cent of the growth in the world labour force over the next 35 years will take place in developing countries.
 An additional 260 million people will enter the workforce during the 1990s.
 Employment in the East Asian economies is projected to grow by 37 per cent between 1990 and 2000, while the labour force will increase by only 17 per cent, leading to an increasing shortage of labour in the region.
 In contrast, employment growth is projected to lag behind labour force growth in South Asia, Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa.
 Although job growth has once again started in many OECD countries, economic growth alone will not be sufficient to bring down unemployment rates significantly, especially among youth and the long-term unemployed.
 Changes in values, attitudes, structures and policies will be necessary.

"Yes."
 Her mother nodded.
 "When I was 17, I met a young man named Andrew.
 I was staying with my aunt on Martha's Vineyard for the summer, and his family had a cottage not far from my aunt's.
 He was a student at Harvard during the year, and he was planning to be a doctor.
 We were inseparable from the moment we met.
 We went out to dinner, went to parties, sometimes just sat quietly reading together.
 But best of all, we would walk or sit on the beach for hours talking.
 He was wonderful, and I loved him with all my heart."
 She paused, smiling as she reached out to touch a lock of Marie's hair.

Apparently her timidness stopped well short of observing the speed limit.
 Alec, Isaac, and Jasmin all jumped out of the car as soon as my house was in sight.
 The car was still doing at least twenty miles per hour when they bailed.
 They faded into the darkened landscape about the time we rolled to a stop.
 I went to open the door, but a delicate brown hand stopped me.
 "I'm sorry you've had such a rough night.
 James and the others will come around eventually.
 Till then just continue being brave and trust Alec.
 He really will move the cielos to protect you."
 She had a thick, beautiful Spanish accent.

The tremendous economic achievements of Japan during the post-war period, followed during the last two decades by other East Asian economic powers and most recently by China, suggest that the time required for transition can be substantially abridged and the fruits of development achieved much sooner than has been accomplished by nations in the past.
 The rising expectations of people around the globe and the potential risks of failing to heed their call have added a greater sense of urgency to the quest for this knowledge.
 Eastern Europe
 The challenges posed by extremely rapid transition are nowhere more graphically depicted than in the current transition of the countries of Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the end of the Cold War and the break-up of the USSR.
 Although this transition is often described in political and economic terms, it is far broader and deeper in its implications.
 These nations are in the midst of a simultaneous multi-dimensional transformation – politically, from authoritarian to democratic forms of government; economically, from a centrally planned command system to free market economies; industrially, from defence-oriented to consumer-oriented production; administratively, from highly centralized to decentralized systems; structurally, from state ownership of property to multiple forms of ownership in all spheres; socially, from closed and isolated to open and internationally integrated societies; culturally, from almost exclusive emphasis on values of equity and collective security to strong emphasis on the values of freedom and individual responsibility.
 The transformation of Eastern Europe and the former USSR is of vital concern to all of us.
 Never before in human history has such massive change been carried out as an essentially peaceful revolution.
 The end of apartheid in South Africa and recent progress in the Middle East show that this process continues to have beneficial repercussions around the world.
 At the same time, this incredible advance has been accompanied by events that have destabilized the political and economic systems of the entire region, led to the break-up of the USSR, war in Bosnia, the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the COMECON trade system, a massive brain drain and the threat of huge waves of economic refugees.

I couldn't possibly be the gorgeous figure he'd brought to life on his canvas.
 I opened my mouth to protest, and then the expression on her face finally registered for me.
 Compassion.
 Acceptance of the viewer, combined with an obvious desire to mend grievous hurts.
 It was exactly how I remembered feeling.
 My questing eyes finally found the last, missing piece.
 There was the gratitude.
 Misplaced on her perfect face.
 Wrong on the features of someone who couldn't possibly need help from a mere mortal, but still there.
 "It's so beautiful.

"It looks like we'd better be going or we'll both be late."
 Les Misérables.
 I managed to put the impending drawing more or less out of my mind for the first half of the day, but I actually missed Britney's constant gossip.
 There was almost no redeeming value to most of what she said, but it did have the benefit of being distracting.
 By the time lunch finally came around I needed some kind of distraction.
 This was my only chance to see Les Misérables performed live before I turned forty.
 Unfortunately, while the conversation at Brandon's table was plentiful, it wasn't very distracting.
 I was quickly realizing that Brandon's friends weren't very nice.
 I'd pretty much known Cassie was a wench, but Vincent seemed even meaner.
 While a story about how someone tricked some poor girl into thinking he was going to ask her out was highly illuminating, it wasn't particularly the kind of thing I wanted to dwell on.

Doi’van though was more focused on the task than the oath.
 He stated, “Each competition is worth points.
 The top five winners of each round of competition earns five points; those that place six through ten earn four points, eleven through fifteen earn three points and so on.
 There are a total of five different events.” Rodregas nodded.
 He had not remembered the point system but he knew well that a knight is unique for his mastering of five different fighting styles.
 Doi’van continued, “The first they call ‘open fist’ which does not really make any sense to me, but it is barehanded with no armor.
 I think you are likely to do very well with that one.
 In fact, I think you would be wise to finish one of the top winners.
 The next is the bow…,” Doi’van glancing at Imeralda.
 Rodregas could not help but smile, “I know you guys think of my skill with the bow in terms of my inability to use the Black Yew bows.

He said something odd to me one time, he said: “Bud, music is a bad demon to have.
 Like hooch.
 If I could have done anything else I would have.”  And, of course, he did, I mean playing at the Vapors wasn’t bringing in enough money to support his small family, so he did books for a paint store.
 He had a business degree, was something of a math whiz, I think, and he worked in the back room of this paint store in a strip shopping center, most days.
 Sometimes my friends and I would walk up there and visit him.
 He looked sad, sitting at this shitty little desk, with a calculator and a pencil in his hand, and bad lighting.
 It was like the stage set for some damn O’Neill play, you know, all whites and grays and shadows.
 But, he greeted us like we were the best thing he’d seen all day.
 And his boss, Mr. Waddell, was a nice guy, a heavy set, crew-cut, ex-Marine, with a face like a catcher’s mitt, and he’d always give us this big, fake hello and hand us all bubble gum.
 Where I first saw Bazooka Joe.

He was bleeding, so he would be losing strength as well.
 Whoever his assailants were, they had him trapped.
 Rodregas violently kicked out with one leg, but his stabbing attacker avoided the blow.
 He did let up on the knife for a second though.
 Instead of following up, Rodregas used the momentum of his kick to swing his body sideways.
 Skilled, close up fighting was all about leverage.
 Instead of resisting the attacker’s strength Rodregas pushed down on the earth with his hands and lifted his body up and to the side, curling the leg he had kicked out underneath.
 He planted his foot under his body.
 His attackers seemed confused, grabbing him and trying to counter his change of position.
 Rodregas only had one leg under him, but he pushed off with it with all his strength and thrust himself up.

He dodged down and then in close and with his hands free simply grabbed the opposing squire from the top and bottom edges of his breast plate.
 He then heaved the armored man in the air, something even he could only do for a moment, and then slammed him down onto the smooth sands of the arena.
 Nordien hit with such force that his arms and legs flew like a small doll’s.
 Rodregas fell on top of the armored form, grabbed the bottom of the helmet, and ripped it off.
 Unfortunately, it was firmly secured.
 When Rodregas ripped it off he took a good section of jaw with the helm.
 Rodregas then threw the helm aside and punched the man in the face, full strength, several times.
 His first hit smashed the front of Nordien’s face.
 The second blow shattered it.
 The third blow smashed the head to pulp.

Ravenhurr was usually very solitary.” “What else do you remember about their conversation or about Van’dret?” asked Imeralda of Rodregas.
 “Nothing, I was a guard who did my duty and kept my nose out of things.
 I know little of most Immortalists other than what is common knowledge.” The four talked a bit more and then split up.
 To Rodregas’ discomfort, Jordaan and Imeralda left together.
 Doi’van trailed the others and then stepped back toward Rodregas room.
 Rodregas sagged against the bed, the wound of losing Imeralda hurting more than those of his flesh.
 “You said you knew she was a Nymph,” stated Doi’van.
 Rodregas nodded.
 He wanted sympathy, but he knew that the straight talking Doi’van was not likely to give him any.
 “I know.

What an emotion-packed day.
 She'd been reunited with her family, learned that her father and brother had reconciled, broken up with Davis, and spent an entire weekday morning with her father.
 She smiled as she reached into her closet for a housedress.
 She would have sworn that her father was more like Davis than like Rick, but she was pleased to realize that he really was more like Rick.
 He'd stayed home from work to be with her, and he'd held her.
 And he hadn't been upset that she'd broken up with Davis.
 He just wanted her to be happy.
 That was what Rick wanted for her.
 Tears tightened her throat as she remembered the anguish on his face when he'd told her that he was the key to the doorway to 1927.
 He'd desperately wanted to keep her with him, to marry her, and he could have kept his discovery to himself and never told her he knew how to help her get home.

Then something reminds me to turn from worshiping the creation to worshiping its creator.
 To adore a feeling or state of mind, such as the revelation of beauty in nature or the way a lover makes me feel, may involve nothing but selfishness.
 But to adore the creator of that feeling, God for creating nature, a lover for giving me a piece of her heart, or parents for providing warmth and safety, that is appreciation, gratitude, untainted by the selfishness that all sin is made of.
 Maybe if I practice this exercise, try to catch myself in each act of admiration, and turn my worship to the creator, I will gradually learn to adore God the father, and God the spirit.
 But for now, my thoughts drift back to Eric.
 I have tried, on this trip, to relive our whole two years of brotherhood.
 And now I reconsider the fact that he didn’t die the moment his head rammed the boulder.
 He lived for a day, during which we got confronted with the possibility that drove my story “Cars”, that he might live another sixty years without the use of his marvelous brain.
 Or, a miracle might bring him back to life.
 A whole new question arises.

 There was no bullshit about Lor—there still isn’t.
 We ended up on her bed, which is a story in itself.

Ultimately I think most of us just want a compelling story, but sometimes the labels that get applied to books get in the way of us discovering them, rather than helping as they are meant to do.
 I think one of the things that made the Harry Potter books so successful was the fact that the whole family could share in the series.
 I remember as Twilight came out thinking that there were plenty of guys who would enjoy Twilight if they ever sat down and read it, but most of them wouldn't ever give it a try.
 My hope with Broken and Torn is that the two stories combine into something that both guys and girls can enjoy.
 The girls are likely to start out with Broken, while guys are likely to pick up Torn and enjoy the extra action there.
 Either way, my biggest hope would be that the guys can introduce their wives and girlfriends to Broken, and the girls can introduce their husbands and boyfriends to Torn.
 We've included excerpts for both Torn and Splintered (the sequel for Broken and Torn) below.
 Acknowledgments: A big thanks to all of the fans who are doing so much to help get the word out.
 There are tons of you that I don't know, but I do want to make special mention of a few dependable souls that I'm very grateful to know, and who've helped in various ways with Torn, and who I suspect will continue to go above and beyond with Broken.
 Cassy & Mark, I'm glad you both turned out to be story addicts just like me.

You haven’t even lived with your family for years now.
 Eugene – Fredric beat me.
 At first he just yelled at me, and beat mom.
 Then after mom disappeared he turned his full wrath to me.
 I think I was five at the time.
 It was like a week after she didn’t come home, he blamed me for it, I don’t remember much after the first few kicks.
 I think I passed out.
 When I woke up it was days later, I think, hard to be sure.
 He just left me to fend for myself, he didn’t care enough to do anything to help, he just left me lying on the floor.
 I still have some of the scars, most have faded, except for some of the burns he gave me.

 She eyed the interior cautiously.

 she asked when he got in without doing so.

When the necromancer noticed Qurrah’s meddling, his mental link pulsed with incredible energy.
 Colors swarmed through his mind, dark purples and reds across a macabre canvas of black.
 He felt his chest tightening, his neck constricting.
 A scrying eye was upon him, now, and he was losing.
 It felt like an arrow pierced his mind, and through it words seeped into his head.

What did happen to you, by the way?"
 "I came to my senses.
 Take your ring, Davis."
 "Listen, Marie, you don't know what you're saying.
 We can push the date back a bit, get married in October instead of September."
 "What part of `I don't want to marry you' do you not understand?"
 She grinned, because he was obviously taken aback.
 "Yes, I've changed.

The poor are poor both because they have no assets and because their time and labour have low or no economic value.
 Poverty persists wherever the human resource is under-valued.
 To eradicate it, there is need for a paradigm shift from unskilled to skilled work.
 While educated unemployment is high in many developing countries, in most cases the quality and relevance of the education to employment opportunities is far from adequate.
 Here too, fully qualified technical and professional workers are in short supply.
 There is even a shortage for educated workers with a high level of general language and communication skills to fill the job opportunities being created for business process outsourcing.
 On an average, 50 per cent of firms surveyed in a cross-section of developing countries report that skill shortages are a serious constraint on their growth.
 Firms that adopt new technologies report even more serious problems.
 In addition, the work force in many developing countries also lacks advanced productive skills for agriculture and a broad range of other basic vocations.
 The proportion of the labour force in the 20-24 age category that have undergone formal vocational training ranges from a low of 5 per cent in countries such as India and 28 per cent in Mexico to as high as 96 per cent in Korea.

I promised myself over and over again that if I ever had children, I would never beat them.
 Chapter 7: Now the Truth Comes Out My phone is ringing but this time it is the hands free unit in my ear, my real cell phone number, not the crack-berry.
 I am not here alone, in fact there are about twenty undercover officers with me, but I’m no cop.
 On the phone is lead undercover narcotics officer Denny White.
 Officer White wants to do a last minute sound check on the wire that I am wearing taped to my back.
 It seems that my lack of noise has caused the undercover officers who surround me in cars, vans and bushes to become concerned that they have lost sound.
 They haven’t heard a word from me since my last crack-berry conversation with Ashley, the suspect that I have set up in exchange for dropping pending drug dealing charges.
 They are not my charges.
 They belong to my son.
 He is the real drug dealer.

I closed my fist around it, mostly because I had seen him do the same, and instantly I knew what I wanted to see.
 I opened my palm up, grinning triumphantly, and exposed my creation for Chevelle to see.
 Balancing there was a slightly misshapen but undeniable sculpture of a small black horse.
 Chevelle rolled his eyes.
 Still smiling, I looked back to the stone, but it had returned to its uninteresting round shape.
 Chevelle answered my unspoken question.
 “Yes, it’s… tricky.” He smiled a little at using Steed’s word.
 “You can’t change something’s makeup, but you can change the way it appears.
 You can move it, but only if you’re near.
 You can stop someone’s heart, but you can’t make them feel happy about it.” He hesitated after that last part, contemplating, and then continued, “You can manipulate the elements, move water, draw it from the ground, but you cannot easily make it appear from nothing… though one can usually collect moisture from the air.

I'll bet she just got some really, really bad news."
 I felt a dull ache starting behind my eyes.
 "Just because I finished my Physics doesn't mean I don't have other stuff I need to do, and I don't even want to guess at what would make her go that white.
 I just hope whatever it was turns out not to be as bad as she thought it was."
 Britney rolled her eyes.
 "Please, like you don't have just as much reason to hate her as me.
 Besides, what other homework could you possibly have?
 You're like the most anal person I know when it comes to doing your homework.
 Therefore you finished it all last night, and have nothing that could possibly be more important than talking to me."
 Her logic sucked, but that didn't bother me even half as bad as how sure of herself she was.

I mean, she’s my best friend, and she’s in love with me.
 Art – We’ve covered that.
 Jim – Did your dad ever cover what to do in such a situation?
 Art – No he didn’t, most of his advice so far has been geared to identifying women who might give you a chance.
 Jim – No tips on what to do when you have her?
 Art – Nope.
 Dad only ever dated one girl, and he ended up marrying her.
 Jim – What the hell kind of expert on women does that make him then?
 Art – One with a narrow range of study, limited to one subject.
 But it’s better than what you have.

There were more than a few that cannot go on, even if you had won.
 You finished eighth overall in the tournament, with a second place white ribbon for the joust.
 Several of those who would now be higher are too injured to continue.
 So you are now in fourth place overall.
 Geriodon and Nordien were the top two finishers,” said Doi’van.
 Rodregas nodded.
 The pain was easier to manage knowing that at least he was still in the running for the tournament championship.
 Imeralda stepped into his sight shaking her head, “You men are crazy sometimes; you actually look pleased!
 If your armor had not held you would be dead now.
 And it is not like you are fighting someone who deserves to die.

"What do you mean?"
 "Breakfast in bed, washing my car, now watching TV."
 "You call that a date?"
 "Yeah.
 What do you call a date?"
 "You know--going out to dinner and then dancing or to a concert or something."
 "I'd rather wash my car and have a pizza delivered."
 She frowned.
 "Why?"
 "Because we have a better chance to get to know each other."

Maybe she should see if she could carry one back.
 That thought made her chuckle.
 Rick drew back to look down at her.
 "What's so funny?"
 "I was thinking that I should take a television back with me."
 He smiled.
 "You might have a hard time explaining that."
 Taking her face in his hands, he wiped her cheeks with his thumbs.
 "We'll try again tomorrow, OK?"
 "OK." "I need to go get dressed now--I have to go to work."

“I would encourage you to be careful on your trip over.
 You did hear about what happened to Ravenhurr?” asked Taiga.
 Van’dret almost felt his eye brows rise, “of course, but what should I watch out for?
 I heard it was just some sort of accident.
 I was not aware that any of the Knights of the Order were implicated.” Taiga smiled and waved a hand in a dismissing motion.
 “Oh, don’t misjudge my words.
 I did not mean to imply any misdeeds of our valiant Knights of the Soaring Heavens.
 I am not aware of any of them doing much of anything, much less kill an Immortalist.” “Than what should I keep my eye out for?” asked Van’dret.
 He was becoming even more curious to the direction of the conversation.
 “You, my fine Van’dret, are more in the world than most of us.

We were breathing heavily.
 I leaned my head against the tree’s cold bark, wanting to disappear from it all.
 “Where’s Seth?” Emily asked.
 I raised my head.
 “We haven’t found him yet.” Her eyes widened.
 “What do you mean, you haven’t found him yet?” “I crashed into Jazell, who was doing, like, forty,” Jason pointed to me.
 “Then we both found you fighting beasts with your fiery fingertips of death.” She raised an eyebrow.
 “Fiery fingertips of death?” “Hey,” he shrugged, “Jazell’s sarcasm is contagious.” “Anyway, we better find Seth before he gets into some serious trouble,” I said, and walked off.
 I went farther down the hill and the fighting spread out more.
 I tripped on a dead root and cursed as I stood back up.

I had never agreed to the union, but I avoided telling him it was not possible.
 It would be only valid in his mind.
 But then again, what would that hurt?
 I accepted the dress from him, looking it over.
 It was poorly made and ill-fitting, but had potential as a design.
 I sat, using magic to work on the seaming and arrange the pearl strands and beading in a more pleasant pattern while deciding how best to deal with him.
 He was watching me intently.
 “We will have such prosperity.
 Think of it, with your magic, we will be able to conquer anything.
 Whatever we need, whatever we want, it will be nothing but a flick of your wrist.” I froze.

She twisted her head about to kiss his throat.
 "I think about you all the time.
 I think about kissing you and touching you--with your shirt off."
 She kissed him, her hands moving restlessly over his chest.
 Nuzzling his ear, she told him, "It's probably wrong for me to tell you these things.
 But I want to tell you everything.
 I want you to know how I feel."
 Rick pulled her onto his lap and began devouring her mouth.
 If he didn't know better, he'd swear she was the most cunning seductress he'd ever known.
 Her innocence combined with her confession was a powerful aphrodisiac.

Liz – Mother, we’ve been over this before…
 Cleo – Yes, yes, I know you’re sticking with Jim, and hoping that one day he’ll see the light.
 Well Elizabeth it will never happen.
 Liz – We’ve been over this too mother, he’s not gay, just because he didn’t accept your…
 Cleo – And you’re not listening to me dear.
 Jim being a man, and inherently flawed for being so, is never going to realize that you love him.
 The only way that he might get it is if you let him know strait out how you feel.
 Liz – How?
 Just come out and tell him that I love him?
 Cleo – No Elizabeth, you tell him that you love him, and give him an instructional pamphlet with diagrams and small words, not too much in the way of color and shapes because he might get distracted and forget to read the text, not to mention ignore you when you’re exposing your deepest feelings.

I only wanted to be proficient with my staff, not a master.”
 A tiny bit of panic crept into Harruq’s voice.
 “Yeah, but, but, it’s only an hour or two, and who said you were proficient anyway?
 I could beat you without trying, and so could anyone better than me.
 It would be stupid now to just stop and…”
 Aurelia crossed the distance between them and placed her hand across his mouth to shut him up.
 A grin lit her entire face.
 “Okay, Harruq.
 I will do as you wish and keep meeting with you.”
 “For sparring,” he said after she pulled her hand away.

It always seemed like the kids who moved in partway through the year usually had some kind of instant in with the cool crowd, but that probably wouldn't happen for me.
 It wasn't that I didn't want to make friends; I just wasn't very good at it.
 My equilibrium seemed to have returned, so I took a few unsteady steps around to the back of the truck.
 If I didn't return with a box soon Mom would rush out expecting the worst.
 Unless she got caught up visualizing some new project, in which case it would be hours before she thought to come check on me.
 We'd moved the beds and most of the other heavy items in earlier, which helped explain my exhaustion, but that didn't make the pile of remaining items in the back of the truck any less foreboding.
 I decided to take the easy way out, and picked up a couple of blanket-wrapped mirrors.
 I didn't unwrap either of them.
 That was dangerous too.
 The face that'd look back out of the glass would look almost more like hers than mine.

In front of the stable was a large bony horse, dappled in brown and white.
 Rodregas thought her name was Tory or Torin, he could not remember which.
 She was an older horse, in her early twenties, and was known for her mild manor.
 She was saddled and ready to go, evidently she was Korin’s planned mount.
 Rodregas took a deep breath and calmly walked out of the keep and over to the stables.
 It was not large, ordinarily holding only about a dozen horses.
 He looked around to find that it was emptied out, except for the two carriage horses.
 They must have been left in case Ravenhurr wished to travel, which would be unlikely with all his guards and servants scattered over the town, but good servants did not take their master’s transport from him.
 In the open central area, he saw both the small carriage and the supply wagon that Ravenhurr used for traveling and carry supplies back and forth to the keep.
 He looked at it and smiled.

Rachel's promise somehow seemed like it belonged from another time.
 The sincerity pulled me further out of my safe, numb shelter.
 Something in me wanted to confide in her, was willing to risk the pain of facing reality, but I was too far gone to be able to put what I was feeling into words.
 I shook my head again, not sure if it was a refusal or something else entirely.
 Rachel took it as the former and sat down next to me, pulling her knees up tight against her chest.
 A few seconds later I heard the howl of an after-market exhaust fed by a turbo-charged engine.
 The green Honda that came screaming through the parking lot was hardly recognizable as an Accord.
 It was approaching too quickly, but I couldn't bring myself to care.
 Besides, Rachel seemed unconcerned.
 Rachel helped me up as the car came to a screeching halt, all four tires locking up to slide it around so that the passenger side was facing us.

And then the questions.
 Had the Council known she’d gone running because I laughed at her?
 Had the thistle grown as she stood beside me?
 Was that what had caused the sneezing?
 Evelyn would tell them I was there.
 They would come for me.
 There would be another inquisition.
 What had the Council member told Fannie?
 He must have known I was a witness, why else would he have been there?
 I could still see the anger on her face.

He didn't have a big collection of movies, and he didn't think it would be a good idea to take her out to rent one right now.
 "Why don't we see what's on television?"
 "The box?"
 "Yes."
 "Don't you watch talkies on it?"
 "Well, sort of.
 The programs aren't like movies--well, some of them are.
 Most programs are shorter--half an hour or an hour."
 He went to get the TV guide and found the listing for Saturday evening.
 A western had come on at 9:00.

I half expected to feel his touch—perhaps he’d merely camouflaged himself—but my hand was empty.
 I looked around, baffled.
 The makeshift audience wore easy, amused smiles.
 They watched me, not the vacant space from which Grey had evidently disappeared.
 And then I noticed someone beside me who hadn’t been there before… it was him.
 “How…” But he was gone again.
 I’d been staring right at him and had no idea where he’d gone.
 I was just beginning to doubt whether I’d seen him at all when I spotted him standing across the circle, grinning fiendishly while he dangled an object from his hands.
 It was the feather Ruby had tied in my hair.
 I’d forgotten about it.

“No,” she said, leaning on her staff.
 “Why did you save me?”
 He kicked his toes into the dirt, unable to piece together the chaotic mess inside his head and heart.
 All he could think of was what his brother had told him to do.
 “Qurrah said to kill you if I didn’t love you…”
 “Yet you didn’t,” she said.
 Harruq nodded, but said nothing else.
 “ _Hana fael!_ ” a voice cried from far down the alley.
 Both turned to see an elf raise his bow and fire.
 “Look out,” Aurelia said, shoving Harruq aside.

Alec's mom was tiny.
 It was easy to see where Rachel got her slight frame from, but there was more than just genetics at work.
 I'd never seen someone with so little extra flesh on their bones, at least not outside a hospital.
 It seemed she should be wearing a hospital gown instead of the white, flower-print summer dress I was almost sure cost more than my whole wardrobe.
 "We're experiencing a time of more than usual difficulty, Mother, but that isn't why I've come by.
 I wanted to present my friend Adriana to you.
 She'll be staying with us for the next few weeks."
 I got a distracted smile.
 "That's nice, dear.
 You remind me so much of your father.

Aurelia struggled to her feet.
 The well of magic inside her was dry.
 In time, her strength would return, but she doubted the necromancer would give her a day to rest.
 She used a bit of the magic she did have left to summon her staff.
 If she were to die, she would die fighting any way she knew how.
 The man in black paused, extended his hands, and began to cast.
 He would give her no chance to strike.
 A blade stabbed his side.
 Velixar whirled, his speed far beyond any mortal.
 He stepped past Felewen’s slash and slammed a hand against her chest.

When they finally did, I thought they we’re gonna die laughing.
 And then you turned that dark red color and ran off.
 And then they laughed even harder.
 Eugene – I didn’t use any hand signs damnit.
 Jim – I know, you used your cache of ‘your mamma’ jokes on em.
 Am I right?
 Come on, am I right?
 Your momma is so fat she eats Wheat-Thicks!
 That would have done it.
 Eugene – No, I didn’t call their mom’s anything, cut it out damnit, I didn’t do anything to make them angry.

Rodregas wondered if Doi’van had lost his balance because he had been trying to fly instead of walk.
 As they stepped out of the room of Infernal sigils and carefully closed the door behind them, Doi‘van still seemed unsteady and Rodregas wondered if his own experiences had prepared him more naturally for this.
 Rodregas had changed bodies before.
 “Doi’van, why don’t you sit down and rest for a second?
 I will check on Imeralda,” Doi’van nodded his thanks and sank down on the floor.
 Doi’van seemed to need to think more than rest, but either way Rodregas made sure he was ok and then went to check on Imeralda.
 He hoped she had not touched the One Tree.
 As he approached where Imeralda had shown them the door he was dismayed to see only black stone.
 “Damn,” he said quietly.
 He went to the middle where the door had been and was relieved when he was able to step through the invisible but open doorway.

She'd walked 84 years into the future.
 She'd spent the entire day alone with a man she'd never met before.
 She'd .
 .
 .
 She frowned for a minute, trying to see all this from his point of view.
 It must be as strange for him as it was for her--a woman from the past had walked into his garden.
 He didn't believe in such things any more than she did, but he'd done his best to help her get back.
 And he'd been so kind and considerate, introducing her to the marvels of his time, seeing to her comfort, holding her when she was frightened .

Probably all of us high school seniors worried about the reality that soon we would be on our own, sent out to face a rather scary world.
 For a while, that was Eric’s obsession.
 The atom bomb threat had recently gotten re-stoked when Khrushchev and Kennedy held a stare-down to decide who could launch nuclear missiles from the western hemisphere and who couldn’t.
 At a coffeehouse near the college I would attend, we overheard people talking about Jack Kerouac and the Beat generation, which Kerouac described as all of us who grew up after Hiroshima and consequently understood just how fragile and tentative life was.
 The end of the world was a recurrent theme of these writers who got called the Beats.
 Any second some madman or tyrant could push the button.
 Kapow, our race is a goner.
 See that coming and, walloped by dread reality, spooked beyond reach of old customs and authority, our nature cries, “It’s out there somewhere, whatever it is.
 Go find it.” Eric and I bought Kerouac’s On the Road, and checked out Dharma Bums and his latest, Big Sur, a memoir in minimal disguise, about a fellow who goes to a cabin in the forest to recover from drunkenness and fame.
 Imagine Henry David Thoreau as a neurotic who returns to Walden Pond and finds psychosis awaiting him there.

All we want is you.”
 The man paled.
 “Me?
 What do you want me for?
 The elves…‌they sent you to attack me, didn’t they?
 Whatever they paid you, I can double it.
 Triple it!”
 Qurrah shook his head.
 “No elf hired us, and no gold was put in our pockets.”
 The flaming whip appeared, charring grass as it touched the ground.

 But Pete’s—

 He’s my brother.

They are complicated and wicked things.
 And the ancient language is… tricky.
 Definitely something you should stay away from.
 Years of learning and practice and you can still wreck a spell pretty good.” I thought about that for a moment.
 Steed jumped up.
 He held out a hand to me.
 “What do you say we water the horses?” I didn’t have to ask my horse to kneel; Steed just grabbed my waist and threw me up.
 He was mounted before I had settled into the saddle and our horses took off, galloping north in synchronization.
 I looked back for Chevelle.
 He was leaning forward, legs nearly straight in the stirrups as his stallion raced to catch us.

She swallowed again, remembering every kiss she and Rick had shared.
 It was as if Hollywood had been a separate world, a world in which she’d been .
 .
 .
 queen.
 But she was back now.
 Davis was her fiancé, and she had no business kissing Rick, no business sitting in his kitchen in nothing but his pajama top.
 Reddening, Marie set her glass down and headed for the stairs.
 “I’m going to take a shower.” She couldn’t believe what she’d done.
 She could almost excuse herself for kissing Rick in Hollywood, say that he’d been part of the dream.

"You like the painting then?"
 I nodded, and then shivered.
 It's amazing how a near complete loss of physical control can burn through your energy reserves.
 Alec frowned.
 "I'm sorry.
 I forget sometimes how much easier it is for you and Rachel to catch a chill.
 Let's get you inside where it's a bit more temperate."
 It seemed like such a waste, leaving the grotto after all the work that'd been put into transforming it, but Alec waved away my protests.
 He easily cradled me in one arm, while carefully picking up my painting with his free hand.
 A short time later, we were back inside the house and headed towards his room.

At least I tried but you're just too stinking stubborn.” Seth flashed me a smile.
 “It's what you love the most about me.” I punched him in the arm.
 “Who said I loved anything about you.
 Maybe I like puppies more.
 At least they listen, mostly.” “Ow, that hurts,” he said and clutched his side.
 I laughed and felt the world brighten a bit.
 “You're so annoying.
 You can add that to the list.” “You just love to insult me,” Seth grinned.
 “Is it your new hobby?” “It will be if you keep annoying me,” I fought the urge to punch him again.
 He just rolled his eyes at me.

Our king is a spiteful, paranoid one.”
 “Not my king,” Harruq muttered loud as he dared.
 He meant to say more but stopped as another man neared the fountain.
 He was large, well-muscled, and scratching at a long beard that stretched down to his belt.
 In a massive voice, he shouted to the mulling throngs.
 “The royal guard is in need of able-bodied men to help rebuild the walls of the city,” he shouted.
 “The work will be hard, but we offer a threepence of copper a day.
 Come to the castle and ask for Alvrik.”
 He repeated the message three more times and then wandered back north.
 “A threepence,” Harruq said.

The peace force would intervene automatically and unconditionally – defensively and, if necessary, offensively – to protect the sovereignty and international borders of any member country, provided that it conformed to the rules under the charter.
 The organization could also assist members in fighting drug trafficking and terrorist activities.
 The benefits of this cooperative peace-keeping mechanism would be manifold:
 Since the charter would bind members and the alliance to eschew the use of force and aggression for any reason, it would represent a stabilizing, non-provocative, non-offensive defence.
 Its charter could also include specific provisions for close association with other international forces.
 Its combined strength and technological capabilities would exceed those of any of its members and constitute a substantial deterrent to aggression against any member country.
 It would significantly reduce the costs of security for members, possibly by up to 50 or 75 per cent, without compromising their legitimate security needs.
 The more members, the lower the defence expenditure required by each, both because the collective force would be larger and because the number of potential adversaries would be reduced proportionately.
 The organization of a World Army, run on well-defined and transparent lines with appropriate mechanisms for control and responsiveness, would help eliminate the need for countries to maintain their own large standing armies.
 Ultimately this could enable other nations to follow the lead of Costa Rica, which abolished its military forces several decades ago.

We delighted in Russell's arguments that Christianity was the principal enemy of moral progress in the world.
 Dismiss Christ, trust ourselves, we would discover the solution.
 Simple.
 After a couple of Russell’s books, Eric brought home Thus Spoke Zarathustra, by Friedrich Nietzsche, a strangely enchanting poet.
 Zarathustra claimed that some of us could become supermen.
 First, our spirits would need to brave the desert like camels, forsaking our past, our heritage, all the values of common people.
 Once we had finished forsaking, we would metamorphose into lions and proceed to slay the dragon called "Thou Shalt".
 After burying the dragon, the lion would die and resurrect as a child, the infant superman, innocent and forgiving, a new beginning, a sacred Yes.
 Then, we could discover and assert our own wills, and use those wills to conquer and change the world.
 On a Sunday morning in January, a few days before my mom’s release from the hospital, a gang of us high school boys sat naked atop a giant flat boulder in a desert oasis called Palm Canyon, a few miles out of Borrego Springs and a two-mile trek past the end of a dirt road.

Rodregas raised his arm up and threw his club forward with all his strength.
 There was no time to see if his club hit Junnit or if the half AElfin maiden ran.
 Rodregas half ran and half jumped to the next circle, where Ravenhurr stood with raised arms.
 Ravenhurr was focused on his inner magic and was not prepared for his own guards’ sudden action.
 Rodregas grabbed Ravenhurr’s arm and his belt, and using his weight and momentum against Ravenhurr, threw him bodily into the circle of colorful crystals where the half AElf maiden had stood moments ago.
 Ravenhurr, in an amazing act of balance, almost caught himself.
 He seemed to defy gravity as he hung in the air.
 Rodregas tried to reach out to push Ravenhurr into the circle, but before his hand touched the sorcerer, Ravenhurr lost his balance and fell into the circle.
 The moment that Ravenhurr crossed into the circle he started to burn.
 His body twisted in pain as he burned the same blue fire of creation that he had called forth to rip apart a man’s soul and steal the physical essence of a Celestial Lion.

 He opened his eyes and stopped breathing.
 Marie emerged from the fog and started running toward him.

 She leapt into his arms, laughing and crying.

 She began covering his face with kisses.

I was exhausted, but I couldn't fall asleep.
 Every time I closed my eyes, I saw dark shapes hurtling towards me.
 After looking at the clock for the thousandth time, I finally got up and went downstairs.
 The lights were still blazing, just as I'd left them.
 I debated for several seconds before opening the door and stepping out into the darkness.
 Somehow the porch light didn't reach out as far into the yard as I'd remembered.
 Alec appeared on the edge of the light with such suddenness that a startled yelp escaped me despite my best efforts.
 "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you."
 Strangely enough, I believed him.
 He was moving with the same, over-controlled care I'd seen him use around Rachel.

The boy wasn't as cute as Alec, but he was so close I could hear those cosmic scales being melted down into something useless again.
 Paperweights maybe.
 I didn't want to see the mess my water had made of his shirt, so I started at the top and worked my way down.
 I'd seen better hair in a couple of fashion magazines, but not very many.
 Casually windswept, straight blond hair had become iconic sometime in the last few years, and this boy either spent an hour on his hair each morning, or the wind in Utah was kinder and gentler than the wind in Minnesota.
 Kinder, and currently working on its cosmetology license.
 His skin was exquisitely tanned, lighter than Jasmin or Alec's, but exactly suited to his lighter hair tone.
 Friendly gray eyes perfectly spaced above some of the most natural looking white teeth I'd ever seen.
 My heart would have started slowing down if I'd been sure the display of teeth was a smile, but there was something about the expression that defied classification.
 Gritting my teeth slightly I let my gaze continue on down to assess the damage, only I couldn't.

Some analysts of the record see things in it, which I’ve heard you deny, yet, there does seem to be something underneath the surface of these songs, something darker.
 Dave Marsh described it as “Mansonish deviltry mixed with Buffalo Springfield lyrics and Cream jams.”  It’s this Charlie Manson element that I’d like to hear you talk about, this school of thought that the record is some sort of coded message, a hint of what was to come, a gateway to the Apocalypse, according to Crawdaddy.
 BG:  	Is that a question?
 CM:  	It’s a whole area of question.
 It’s a school of thought—surely you’ve heard or read some of this.
 But I’ve never heard you talk about it.
 BG:  	I dropped out of school, especially schools of thought.
 CM: 	Um--
 BG: 	You got kids playing records backwards, you got kids hearing drug references in everything, from “Lucy in the Sky” to “In Real Time”.
 You got academics plumbing rock music now for the kind of meanings they dug out of Wordsworth and Coleridge.

"Everything was almost perfect.
 If there was anything less than ideal, it wasn't your fault."
 "Still, I'd like to make it up to you."
 He looked down at my ankle and then smiled with a hint of mischievousness.
 "I suppose dancing is out, but I think I've got something that'll do just about as well."
 Alec carefully picked me up before I could respond.
 A few seconds later we were outside, traveling through the darkness with a breakneck speed that would've been suicidal with merely human vision.
 I was completely lost by the time we came around a corner and my inferior eyes were finally able to see the first hints of light up ahead.
 Alec slowed, to prolong the suspense as we got closer.
 Even so, it was only a few more steps before the grotto materialized out of the darkness before us.

Can I call you Adri?"
 I shook my head.
 "I prefer my full name, Mr..." "Wilkenson, Mayor Wilkenson.
 Is your mother home?"
 Suddenly struck by the fact that living in the country meant there wasn't anyone around to hear your screams, I almost lied, but for whatever reason I believed him.
 Maybe because he exuded the false, overabundant sincerity I'd come to associate with both the class presidents I'd known back in Minnesota.
 "She's out photographing one of the parks.
 Is there a message you'd like me to pass on?"
 He looked surprisingly uncertain, almost like he was used to working from a script, and didn't know what to do when things didn't go as planned.
 "Do you know when she'll be back?"

"That's enough, Vincent."
 A trace of rebelliousness flared up at Brandon's chastisement, but Vincent buried it so quickly I almost didn't have enough time to classify it before it disappeared.
 Interestingly enough, I could see Cassie out of the corner of my eye, and she didn't look any happier than Vincent.
 The rest of lunch flew by.
 I'd never realized how much fun it could be to belong to a group.
 Things weren't ideal; I'd never met a group with so many inside jokes.
 Half the time I felt like there was an entire conversation being carried on over my head, but sitting next to Brandon left me with such a tingly feeling all along my right side that I didn't really mind.
 Not even the presence of a pop quiz in History managed to faze me.
 Almost before I knew it I was sitting down in Physics.
 As usual, Alec slipped into class a half second before the bell.

The fire in me itched to burn him.
 I seethed.
 “Unbind my thoughts.” “Freya.” His voice was smooth.
 “You don’t understand.” I fumed, “Well, I’m sure that has nothing to do with you rummaging around in there.” He shook his head and his complete lack of agitation caused me to take pause.
 I supposed it was possible he actually couldn’t free my thoughts.
 If the council had bound me, likely all of them would need to reverse it.
 And they wouldn’t do that.
 Because they had convicted me.
 I might have asked how the process would work, but I was too furious to pursue conversation with any kind of composure.
 And it didn’t matter, because they’d already counted me guilty.

The prints were shoed, about the size of elves, but the treads were irregular.
 Whatever stayed here, there were a lot of them.
 Near the center of the camp the ground was beat down with tracks, circling a ring of stones.
 I found remnants inside, and ashes.
 A crude fire pit.
 Around that, several feet out, were various logs, I assumed for sitting around the pit for warmth.
 A few huts were situated about the camp but their construction was unlike anything I’d seen before, very poorly built.
 I ducked inside one and was shocked to see it was full of possessions.
 Clothing, bedding, so much left behind.
 I had thought they’d departed suddenly, but I was confident then that it was not of their choosing.

It had to be Adapt Korin.
 He nearly leaped off the bed and looked for a sword but of course there was none.
 He stepped in front of the bedroom door as he quickly did his best to close the broken study door.
 He quietly unlocked it and stepped back and said simply, “Enter,” and waited for the Adapt to come inside.
 Korin came into the room with a relaxed step that showed him to be much more comfortable than Rodregas was.
 Korin was a good looking man.
 It was always weird with him.
 He changed bodies so often that you always felt like you were meeting someone new, but it was not long before you realized that it was Korin.
 He wore a slim male body that was well-built, not much over 20 years old, with blue eyes and blond hair.
 Rodregas was not sure what to say to him so he stood there simply looking.

Those clear, deep eyes met mine for a second, seeming to look past the surface and all the way down to the bleeding mental gash that'd just triggered my most recent collapse.
 I was trying to marshal my arguments, but his eyes wiped my mind clean.
 I couldn't form another coherent thought until he shook his head and looked away.
 "You need to see the nurse."
 My mind hiccupped for a second.
 There should be some kind of law requiring him to hide those things.
 Sunglasses, or maybe a blindfold.
 "I'm fine.

“When I ran into the… trackers, I had hope Ruby had told the truth and might know where to find you.” He laughed.
 “She tried to hide you, but I recognized the horses out front.” “She tried to hide us?” “Ah, yes.
 Fairies are full of treacheries and wickedness.
 Always meddling in the affairs of others, causing trouble whenever possible.
 They have quite a time.
 At least Red’s only half wicked.” His sister.
 I was having trouble wrapping my mind around it all.
 “Don’t worry, she’s had her fun with you.
 She’ll be helpful now.” He grinned and I wasn’t sure if it was sarcastic.
 “Besides, sounds like you’re the biggest trouble going.

At parties and the beach, girls who got upset and spiteful toward their boyfriends would appear at my side in hopes the boyfriend would object and I would thrash him.
 At Carmen Ranch Club, Eric was on the trampoline, probably showing off for his friend Carol, when he soared too high and got distracted by something.
 He fell sideways, ricocheted off the rail and landed on asphalt.
 Scraped and bruised all over, he went home with Carol, who lived nearby.
 Her parents were gone.
 Whatever they did that afternoon, Eric wouldn’t say.
 But something went wrong, and it sent him into a funk so deep, he gave up the job and asked did I want to go camping up the coast.
 We borrowed surfboards, drove to San Onofre, and pitched a tent on the cliffs.
 Between our assaults on the surf, I told Eric stories about my exploits in Pacific Beach.
 Though he chuckled about my status as top dog, he said, “I hope you know that’s not what being Superman’s about?” “Aw, give me a little credit, will you?” I snapped, annoyed that he had seen through me.

I arrived promptly, eager to get this thing done, and was immediately disappointed to learn that there would be a delay getting the crew together as they had just busted an Ecstasy dealer and part of the crew was stuck hauling, booking and questioning him.
 I was irritated as they wired me up in anticipation of the bust.
 The officers then recorded my call to Ashley where I told her my wife had me watching the kids and unavailable until she returned, so I’d call her in a while.
 I was buying an unknown amount of time while keeping Ashley and Steve on the hook.
 So while I am standing in the lot wired up, not able to call my wife, not able to go anyplace myself, some of the officers take orders for a hamburger run!
 I am now beyond irritated, as their lackadaisical attitude could equal another disappointment and a setback for the mission to get my son on with his life and out of a possible prison sentence.
 They asked me what I wanted from the nearby hamburger joint as they relayed orders to another officer via a cell phone.
 I wanted nothing!
 Eating was the last thing on my mind and my stomach was churning with every passing moment.
 I just wanted to get on with it and go home in one piece.

High above, the skulls quieted, and their fires dimmed.
 When the necromancer noticed Qurrah’s meddling, his mental link pulsed with incredible energy.
 Colors swarmed through his mind, dark purples and reds across a macabre canvas of black.
 He felt his chest tightening, his neck constricting.
 A scrying eye was upon him, now, and he was losing.
 It felt like an arrow pierced his mind, and through it words seeped into his head.
 _Run.
 Die.
 Collapse.
 Fear.

The rest of the pack waited expectantly, milling about partially hidden by Alec's towering figure.
 I turned to ask Donovan what to do next, only to have the words torn away from me as a surge of power washed over me from where Dominic had disappeared.
 A momentary ripple of stillness swept through the pack, and then Dominic reappeared, this time walking on two legs.
 I'd been too overwhelmed by everything else to really register the fact that everyone was wearing some form of stretchy clothing.
 I'd never thought about how changing shapes must make for difficulty when it came to clothing choices, but it appeared someone had solved the problem.
 Dom's black outfit had perfectly matched her fur, and whatever it was, it had shrunk down to fit her four-legged form, while still having enough elasticity to expand out to cover her person shape.
 The girl's clothes had an elastic band of some kind at their necks, legs and arms, while the boys were wearing a pants-like number which cinched down over their waist, as well as just above the knees.
 My preoccupation over what everyone was wearing gave Dom a chance to cover the distance between us.
 Donovan smiled as Dom reached us.
 "I'll leave her in your care then, Mistress Sanchez?"

Thank you."
 Rachel ducked around her brother so she could see the shoes and then smiled before leaning in to whisper.
 "Mom wore those to the Ashure Day Dance, the one where she fell in love with Dad."
 I pulled back in protest, but Alec's grasp on my hand tightened just enough to stop me.
 "She wanted you to wear them.
 They were meant to be worn again tonight."
 My head was still spinning as Alec offered me his arm and led me out of the room.
 There was a limo, easily the largest vehicle I'd ever seen, waiting for us outside.
 We piled into it with plenty of room to spare.
 The bar was fully stocked, but Alec shook his head at Rachel when she made as if to reach for a drink.

So I filed the matter away with other mysteries, of which life offers plenty.
 But on this trip with all its remembering, I may solve the mystery.
 The End of Something Else
 A couple weeks after Eric's funeral, Cliff and I decided we should quit school and move to San Francisco.
 When school let out that day, we went up the street to La Mesa Junior High and found my mom grading papers on the patio behind her classroom.
 We told her our plans and listened while she recited all the reasons leaving now, three months short of graduation, was all wrong.
 She even tried to bribe us, offering to help with money if we would wait until June and apply to a San Francisco college.
 "Nope," I said.
 "If we wait, we probably won't go."
 Cliff was more sensible.

 I mean, they weren’t teachin’ me “Frogleg Blues.”  Right?
 They weren’t teachin’ me Skip James, Robert Johnson, Fred McDowell.
 CM:  	So, what happened next?
 BG:  	Well, high school went on, keeping me in one place, while my mind was traveling.
 I wanted so bad to make music, and when we got Black Lung together, I thought, this is it, this is my gateway, my way in.

It was only one word, but he understood.
 I was asking if I could address him in the common dialog, not the official titles and formalities of the Council he might have been used to.
 His head tilted in a nod.
 And we sat so, tucked in the narrow space behind a small library table, for hours.
 He pulled books between us and returned them to the shelves, never once glancing at the papers spread out beside us referencing the northern clans.
 Nothing we studied touched on the histories of those clans.
 Nothing of his histories, nothing of mine.
 But conversation had become easy as soon as I had spoken that first word, as soon as I had said his name and he’d smiled in return.
 I found myself leaning toward him as he spoke, actually paying attention in places; he had a pleasant voice and an unusual dialect.
 He wove histories as if they were stories of his childhood friends instead of useless facts, and I became enthralled.

The prime rule of high school survival involved avoiding situations people could use to ridicule you later, but I'd really wanted a rational explanation for my dreams.
 They seemed so real.
 I needed a friendly face to get me through the rest of class.
 Remembering Alec's smile from earlier, I looked over at him, hoping he'd return my sheepish grin.
 It was almost like he was a different person.
 The smile was gone.
 It'd been replaced with a steely mask that almost completely hid his emotions.
 Only the look in his eyes, and the mechanical pencil in his hand, neatly snapped into two pieces, told me he was mad, that something very much like hatred was washing through him.
 I felt like I'd been punched in the stomach.
 It shouldn't have mattered.

Springing to his feet, he looked around.
 The beach had become crowded while he was asleep, and he didn't see her anywhere.
 "Marie!"
 he called in a moderately loud voice.
 Maybe she'd gone for a swim.
 His heart pounded as he ran toward the waves.
 He hoped she had enough sense not to go out very far.
 Just as he ran into the surf, he heard a familiar laugh.
 He turned to see Marie jump to catch a frisbee.
 She threw it to one of three--no, four--guys surrounding her.

"The truth is, I've fallen well and truly in love with you."
 Chapter 23 Someone was calling my name, but I really didn't want to wake up.
 I was still so tired, and I'd had the most wonderful dreams.
 They were a little foggy now, but they seemed to have involved Alec coming to my rescue, and then holding my hand as I went to sleep.
 It wasn't until I finally placed the familiar voice that everything started coming back to me.
 I sat up with an abruptness that nearly knocked Alec off of his perch on the edge of my bed.
 Him still being there, looking at me with a barely restrained amusement glimmering in his eyes, calmed my racing pulse.
 "You're still here."
 "You sound disappointed.
 Do you want me to leave?"

Yes, like a child.
 A foolish, sulky child.
 Bright sun and chirping birds tore into my finally still senses.
 My eyes squinted open as I resisted the urge to stop the birds.
 It was the first time I’d slept away from my bed; disoriented, I glanced around.
 It didn’t help.
 I’d never been far from home and the new landscape was unsettling.
 But when I looked away, I noticed the neatly stacked pile of fabric and loaf of bread that had been positioned beside me.
 I silently cursed the watchers who had apparently found me during the night.
 I didn’t see them anywhere, so I assumed they’d left me out here as punishment.

Historically, the free market evolved over centuries in conditions of surplus production and stable currency, neither of which exist in Eastern Europe today.
 Efforts to accelerate the development of the market will have first of all to meet the political, legal, social and economic conditions historically required for its creation.
 And these conditions must be met simultaneously.
 4.Macro-economic stability is a precondition for increasing production: It is extremely difficult to increase production in a context of general macro-economic instability and hyperinflation.
 The rapidly falling value of local currencies minimized their utility as a medium of exchange.
 Agricultural as well as industrial enterprises seeking a stable medium in which to hold their wealth increasingly resorted to hoarding marketable, non-perishable commodities such as food grains or converting local currency into foreign money wherever possible.
 This was particularly devastating for agriculture, where higher production was desperately needed to meet consumer demand and reduce dependence on food imports.
 The breakdown of the local currency as an effective medium of exchange was accompanied by an unfavourable shift in the terms of trade between agriculture and industry, resulting from the near-monopolistic position both of the suppliers of farm inputs, especially fertilizers and farm machinery, and the processing units that purchased farm produce, such as dairies and meat processing plants.
 Together, these factors precipitated a rapid fall in farm production and food availability.
 There can be no solution to the food problem without first establishing a stable medium of exchange.

The orc howled at the sensation of a hundred scorpions stinging his flesh.
 Flooded with adrenaline, he hurled Qurrah aside, desperate to break the contact between them.
 Qurrah’s thin body crumpled against the dirt.
 At the sight of it, Harruq felt his rage break loose.
 He slammed his fist into the orc’s stomach, followed by a brutal kick to the groin.
 Harruq rammed his elbows into the orc’s face, baring his teeth in a feral grin as he felt cartilage crunch.
 Staggering back, the orc dropped one of his swords and clutched his face.
 “His sword,” Qurrah shouted loud as he could.
 “Take it, brother!”
 Harruq obeyed without thought.

And electric lights."
 She jumped when the microwave beeped.
 Rick took out the bowl, and when he peeled back the paper, steam came out.
 He extended the bowl, and she touched the food.
 It was hot.
 She looked at him in wonder.
 "How can it be so hot so fast?"
 He shrugged, putting the bowl back in the refrigerator.
 "We have a lot of conveniences we take for granted.
 We know what they do and don't think much about how they do it."

It was like a puzzle piece popping into place.
 I thought, man, here’s a guy, been through the mill, right?
 and he’s singing about singing for everyone and, man, I saw that it was all so selfish, this exile, this block.
 I thought, it’s ego, is what it is.
 How dare I not write songs?
 How dare I?
 So, I picked up my guitar and wrote, “Alison All Gone.”  Lorelei heard me and didn’t come into the room right away.
 She’s very intuitive that way.
 But she knew.
 She heard the words, heard the pain in my voice.

 He expects too much.
 Merely because I am different.

 But she never has to practice.
 He doesn’t expect her to stay in the castle, not even when we have guests.
 No doubt he prefers her not be seen then, embarrassed by her light hair and features.
 It is infuriating!
 I wish I were as strong as he hoped.
 I could do what I wanted then.

As soon as they got home, Marie spread out all their purchases, looking at them with delight.
 "I can't wait!"
 she exclaimed, smoothing her dress over the arm of the recliner.
 Rick smiled.
 "Do you think we have everything we need?"
 "Yes.
 Thank you so much, Rick."
 She flung her arms around him.
 She packed for both of them and finally, unable to find anything else to do, dropped onto the sofa beside him.
 "I'm excited."

So I was slightly less mean by the time Mother Teresa walked to the altar.
 In strong yet gentle English, she said, “Let us ask Our Lady to give us her heart, so that we will offer service to the poorest of the poor.” Neither weathered skin nor stooped shoulders could alter the beauty she exhibited, as she recited from the Gospel of Matthew.
 “Whatever you did for the least of these brothers of mine you did for me.” Her eloquence depends upon simplicity and a talent for repeating for emphasis without condescension.
 Her message always expresses or implies that by serving the poorest of the poor, the MCs minister to Christ in his distressing disguise.
 This morning she quoted, “For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me."
 She only spoke a few minutes, yet three times she asked that we pray for the MCs and the poorest of the poor.
 I joined the receiving line.
 As those of us standing went first, it only took a few minutes, during which I received the clarity to recognize that God, the source of all power, only works through people who stand aside and let him.
 Mother Teresa has built a mighty force of little, brown, meek, powerful women, because she knows and practices the art of humility, as perfectly as anyone I've witnessed.
 Her ego vanishes.

Cessation of violence and conflict settlement often leave unresolved the root causes of conflict, resulting in potential for renewed fighting or social turbulence.
 Peace-building activities should address underlying economic and social factors that prevent the establishment of a stable and secure peace.
 In instances such as Cambodia, Rwanda and Somalia, the vacuum created by the complete collapse of political and economic institutions necessitates a broader role for the UN in re-establishing the peace.
 Peace building has thus far been defined as post-conflict actions to support reconstruction and to strengthen and solidify peace.
 The concept needs to be broadened to include pre-conflict actions and expanded to encompass a wider array of potentially destabilizing factors that lead to conflicts.
 The Commission supports the establishment of an International Centre jointly operated by the UN Security Council and UNESCO to implement peace-building programmes.
 Peace-building activities should be expanded to address security threats issuing from environmental degradation, poverty, migration of population and refugees.
 Many cases of ethnic conflict have an under lying basis of economic deprivation that must be addressed before tensions will permanently subside.
 Others can be mitigated by the introduction of positive economic incentives for cooperation.
 Economic cooperation is already dissipating ethnic tensions and conflict in the Middle East.

“I believe it will,” Seth said through gritted teeth.
 Kojas laughed again but I don’t think any of us saw what was so funny.
 Emily leaned towards me.
 “I think you were right, when you said that I wouldn’t want to meet Kojas.” “Uh-huh,” I said but didn’t really pay attention.
 “I would like to see you try with that sword of yours,” Kojas said and smiled wickedly at Seth.
 I knew he was baiting him.
 Seth narrowed his eyes.
 “You can’t trick me into fighting you, Kojas.” “Yeah, we’re not stupid,” I said and stepped next to Seth with my hands on my hips.
 “I mean, if you’re so smart, than why is your name so stupid.” I giggled.
 “Kojas sounds like toe jazz, whatever that is.” I heard Emily laugh and Jason say, “Burn!” Kojas’ eyes flamed but he formed a tight smile.

But he hadn’t the heart to destroy his crop.
 He simply left.” I felt the tug in my chest at her story, but Ruby’s eyes were dry and clear.
 I wondered how many times she’d told it.
 “I hear he wanders the mountain.
 Probably killing fairies.” Ruby laughed again.
 This time it sounded like genuine humor.
 The tension in the room eased a bit.
 “Ruby.” Chevelle’s tone was respectful as he turned from the window.
 “They’re here?” she asked.
 He nodded and she rose gracefully from her seat.

Recommendations for Accelerating Transition in the East
 Conditions within the 25 nations of Eastern Europe and Central Asia vary significantly enough to limit the scope for broad generalizations on strategy beyond the statement of principles presented in this chapter.
 However, there are a number of specific recommendations applicable to all or most of these countries that can be applied to accelerate the pace and ease the pain of transition.
 1.Generate consensus for the transition programme: The transition should be an expression of the will of the society for change and it should help generate greater unity and harmony within the society.
 Further attempts to put through any macro-economic reform package will meet with strong political and social resistance unless a national consensus on the strategy is arrived at beforehand.
 Any programme involves a set of choices regarding which are the most accept able costs and important benefits.
 Before launching new initiatives, governments should conduct public inquiries and debate alternative packages of policies and practices.
 The inquiry should realistically access the expected costs and benefits of each package.
 After educating the public about the need for choice and the necessary costs involved, the final selection of the most accept able package should be made by the people themselves through a national referendum.
 2.Establish macro-economic stability: The errors in earlier efforts at adjustment and stabilization have led some to argue for a series of compromise programmes that do not seriously ad dress the imminent dangers of hyperinflation and economic collapse.

You had this in the wagon all along.
 Do I really get to have it?” Rodregas smiled and said, “As long as you are sharing the journey with us.” She took several moments to appreciate the armor and started to try it on; Rodregas waited, enjoying her appreciation of his stolen gift.
 Just as she started to calm down he said, “Oh, and didn’t you say something about wanting a bow?
 And quietly, he handed her one of the Black Yew recurves.
 She reached for it with a smile and as soon as she touched it she just stared at it.
 Her expression of wonder made his old dried up heart smile.
 He was not sure how to feel, like a pleased father giving out mid-winter gifts to children, or like a young lover giving flowers to a new crush.
 Rodregas was unsure which reaction was proper now, and which she would want him to feel.
 Doi’van had watched the whole show with the thoughtful expression that he was starting to believe was his normal face to the world.
 “And do you have a full suit of Night Bronze Plate Mail for me and a magic sword or three as well?” he asked in his careful voice.

My beloved grandmother, Mary Garfield, often assured me that a liar was the worst of all people.
 No doubt she recognized how liars teach us not to trust.
 I believe it was Sylvia Curtis, when Eric and I talked to her about Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, who convinced me that Holden Caulfield was right to pour most of his wrath on phonies.
 When Olga Savitsky and I considered founding a church, we agreed that above the entrance would hang a sign, “No bullshit allowed.” After all, God is a matter of life and death.
 In Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Robert Pirsig argues that being stuck is the best place for a mechanic (or a problem solver of any sort) to find himself.
 When we’re stuck, we come to the problem free from any preconceptions.
 I mean to test his argument, because I’m stuck on the word “adore.” Here’s how it happened: in the midst of a period of personal, family, and professional turmoil, I picked up The Practice of the Presence of God, by Brother Lawrence, and discovered that simply reading about this fellow from long ago delivers some peace.
 Not perfect peace, but closer than before.
 Close enough so that friends find my apparent serenity in the midst of turmoil worth remarking about.
 Brother Lawrence was a layman who lived and worked, mostly in the kitchen, at a monastery in sixteenth century France.

I had no clue what was going on.
 Jim – Until grandpa filled you in.
 Art – What a family tradition he started.
 Jim – Did grandma go insane too?
 Art – I don’t think so, but she died when I was six.
 Jim – Not a good way to start a tradition.
 Art – Nope, it could be worse though.
 Jim – Yes it could, it could have karaoke as an integral part of the ceremony.
 Art – Dad has more taste then that, not by much, but enough.
 What do you plan to do about Liz?

I stood up and walked over to Seth.
 He looked up from the ground and saw my troubled face.
 “What's wrong, Jazell?” “I need to speak to you,” I said in a low voice, “alone.” Seth nodded in understanding and I followed him out of the cave.
 We stood off to the side near the edge of the cliff where Emily and Jason couldn't see us.
 For a minute, I didn't say anything because I didn't know what to say.
 I hesitated, but knew that if I told anyone about the dream, it would be Seth.
 So what was the point in waiting?
 “I had a dream last night,” I began.
 “Only it wasn't really a dream, but more of a vision.” Seth nodded.
 “What was it about?” I told him about the cliff and how Kojas had killed the dwarf.

It had been Marie's favorite show.
 She'd been gone four days.
 He'd sat in the garden until nearly 9:00 Tuesday evening.
 He'd slept hardly at all that night, but he dragged himself to work anyway, not wanting to spend all day alone in the house.
 He'd gotten practically nothing done, and coming home at 8:30 had been torture.
 He'd spent that evening and yesterday evening doing exactly what he was doing tonight: sitting in front of the TV, not seeing, not hearing, not moving.
 How could she have become so much a part of him in only five weeks?
 He'd been engaged to a woman who hadn't been as deeply imbedded in his heart and soul as Marie.
 How could his life ever be complete again without her?
 He wondered if she was feeling the same way.

Yearning to avoid my thoughts altogether, I spent much of the day in the mind of my horse.
 And the day passed.
 It was evening again when we stopped.
 I barely noticed the group’s mood; though quiet, they seemed anxious and kept the perimeter close.
 Ruby brought me the book again and I took one long, deep breath before I started back.
 Freya is growing and strong.
 She has amassed a following of sorts, though I suspect it is somehow connected to her frailties.
 There is something endearing about it, but some of it worries me.
 She doesn’t seem to be able to hear as well as she should through her rounded ears and her voice is oddly alto.
 She is a beauty, though, her unusual features earning her extra attention.

We were what they call an underground success, what Memphis specializes in.
 We were talked about but you had to be part of the cognoscenti, the insiders.
 I hated this, if I was aware of it—I really don’t remember.
 Keep in mind, all I wanted to do was play my guitar and write songs.
 And I was writing at an astonishing clip and artists were picking up on it, and, well, the money started coming in.
 See, in a way, I was fortunate.
 I never had to sack groceries at Piggly Wiggly or teach school, or cut lawns.
 Writing songs, I learned early, brought in the bucks.
 And a lot of the talent coming out of Nashville, well, a lot of those guys were singing my stuff.
 See, at that time, everyone wanted to play and sing, but not everyone could write.

She knew she should calm them down, but her first thought was how stupid men could be, men of all races.
 Sure it would have been great for them to get their better quality armor, but they were only alive because of her.
 She was the one who had to come back and shoot the final guards.
 She was the one who had to come back.
 She shot the final guards with the Black Yew bows.
 She was no warrior but had gone back with only a few arrows and rescued them.
 She had patched them up, rounded up the rescued slaves and sought a refuge.
 “Are you insane?” she asked them in a voice that was as cold as her anger.
 Imeralda, her voice dripping scorn, added, “It was only because one of the slaves had family at the local village that we were able to find this refuge.
 Then, no matter how valiant the efforts of healer Durien, he barely kept you two from death’s door.” “So what did I do?” she asked them.

There was something different about it, even though it was gloomy.
 There was more than gloom and sadness in the air this time, it was something cold, like death.
 I shivered because the ground was so cold and hard that it chilled me to the bone.
 Seth’s head blocked out my vision.
 “Hey, you alright?” I sat up and Seth helped me up.
 I rubbed my sore back and looked around, taking in the dead looking trees and shadows.
 “Where are we?” “I don’t know, Jazell.
 The creature must have been a setup to bring us here,” he replied.
 “I think I know who did it.” “It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure that out, Seth,” I pointed out.
 I looked around.

“You don’t have a bow hidden in that wagon do you?
 I have no idea how to use one of these pig stickers, but I am very good with a bow,” said Imeralda.
 She said it clearly expecting him not to have anything.
 Rodregas did, have a bow.
 He had two very nice bows wrapped up in the wagon.
 But, while the short swords he handed them were dangerous, they were common and easy to replace.
 On the other hand, the Black Yew bows were rare and powerful.
 He also thought about the chain mail that he had found in Ravenhurr’s wardrobe.
 While it was way too small to fit him it would fit Imeralda just fine.
 But to give this woman he barely knew such fine armor and weapons was not something to do casually.

You're most welcome for whatever small part I might have played in helping events to unfold as they would have in a perfect world.
 My actions were not such as to merit any large boon from you, but still I must ask one.
 Please never show this note to anyone.
 I ask not for myself, but for the others such knowledge could affect.
 I hope your circumstances continue on much as they are now, but on the chance they do not, I can be reached by leaving a note in the hollow of the lightning-struck tree half a mile to the east of your house.
 --@ Chapter 15 My alarm pulled me out of the strangest night of sleep I'd ever experienced.
 Maybe I'd just been overtired, or possibly the strange, symbol on the note, inked into the place where a signature normally would've been, had reminded me of the other truly alien experience so far in my life.
 Whatever the reason, it felt like I'd spent all night on the edge of one of the incredible, vivid dreams.
 I kept catching glimpses of the characteristic soft glow out of the corner of my eye, but hadn't ever actually slipped into a full-blown dream.
 It'd left me feeling very unsatisfied.

When I was about fourteen years old, I missed curfew, which I knew was a big mistake.
 I tried to open the door with no sound.
 As I turned in the entryway to close the door as quietly as I had opened it, I felt a presence.
 I turned around and two hands were on my neck choking me and shoving me against the door.
 Dino, in the darkness, had a grip on my neck that he would not release.
 I grabbed his wrist and tried to push his hands off to no avail.
 I couldn’t breathe, so I couldn’t talk.
 It was oddly silent except for a pinging sound, as if someone was dropping pennies in a pan.
 It was the sound of the puka shells from the necklace I was wearing landing on the tile floor beneath me.
 Ping, ping, puh dit dit, ping.

“Only, for me, it’s too soon.
 I’ve got a bunch more to learn.” The last couple months of that summer, while I smashed golf balls, played baseball in Mexico on Sundays, and visited my cousins in Pacific Beach, Eric ran around with Margaret Beasley, Pam Greenman, and Lane Campbell.
 Margaret had been my friend longer than anyone except my cousins.
 Since second grade.
 All through elementary school, she was always the smartest in class, and kinder than anybody else I knew.
 She spent eighth grade in my mom's English and Social Studies class.
 Later my mom called her the brightest student she ever taught.
 And her pure and soulful singing would land her, only months after high school, on a weekly television show with a folk group, The Good Time Singers.
 That summer before our senior year, Margaret's best friend was Pam Greenman, who attended our rival high school.
 Lane was someone I probably never would've befriended if not for Eric.

Velixar looked at the elf, dressed in camouflaged armor and holding his wicked bow.
 “You are a scoutmaster for the Quellan elves, are you not?” he asked.
 “I am.
 And you have remained outside our village for several days yet vanish with the morning sun.”
 “Have I done something wrong?” Velixar asked.
 Dieredon frowned, noticing the subtle yet constant changes to the man’s facial features.
 His instincts cried out in warning.
 This man was dangerous.
 “Children have been dying in our forest, all found horribly butchered,” Dieredon said.
 “As you can plainly see, I am nowhere near the forest,” Velixar said.

I ducked Vincent's first blow and retaliated with a gash that opened one side of his chest nearly down to the bone.
 A dark-furred form leaped at Jasmin, but the other wolf mistimed the spring.
 Most of the other pack didn't appreciate just how nimble she was.
 Jasmin dodged to one side and then the two of them were circling, looking for an opening.
 Vincent, the other hybrid, attacked with the strength and fury that'd earned him the position of second in his pack, but he hadn't been expecting to face me in this form.
 As a wolf I weighed in at a solid two hundred pounds, but would've still given up more than a hundred pounds to him.
 Now I had at least six inches and seventy-five pounds on my side of the equation, and he was the one pressed onto the defensive as the fight progressed.
 I caught flashes of action from the other fight as we circled each other.
 Jasmin sprang at her opponent, catching her behind the shoulders as Vincent reeled away from me in a shower of blood.
 I'd finally managed a deeper strike on his arm.

You can add that to the list.” “You just love to insult me,” Seth grinned.
 “Is it your new hobby?” “It will be if you keep annoying me,” I fought the urge to punch him again.
 He just rolled his eyes at me.
 He really is the most annoying person I've ever met besides Emily and myself.
 Wow, he was going to have us both beat.
 “I'm sorry to interrupt your playful banter, but are we actually looking for a place in particular or just some random cave?” Emily's annoyed voice asked us from behind.
 “Yes, just a random cave or a place to stay.
 Why?” Seth asked, just as annoyed.
 “Well,” she said, “a cave won't be found in a forest, so shouldn't we be finding a way out of the forest?” “I know that, Emily,” he said and pointed to the trees.
 “Can you find a way out?

He showed me nothing but kindness.”
 “Then it is a false kindness,” Dieredon said.
 He paused for a moment, grabbed his chest with his healthy arm, and then looked at her again.
 Pain was evident in his eyes.
 “That man has an army of undead.
 I barely managed to hide until daylight.
 Woodhaven is in danger, and so are you.”
 Aurelia stepped back, frowning.
 “Are you sure it was Harruq?”
 “I saw the warrior with my own eyes.

“There is one, and it is you, Qurrah,” Velixar said.
 He pulled out one item more before closing the chest and shrinking it back to its original size.
 In his hand remained a long black whip that curled about as if alive.
 “Weapons may not be your preference, but I trust you will find some use for this.”
 As both brothers watched, the whip burst into flame.
 Velixar cracked it once to the grass, instantly charring the green earth into ash.
 “Why?” Qurrah asked.
 “Magic is not your greatest weapon, my disciple.
 Fear and pain are, and this whip is capable of producing both.”
 The fire died as the whip wound itself around Velixar’s arm like a snake.

Britney wasn't one of them.
 I caught her glaring at me a couple of times out of the corner of my eye.
 Under normal circumstances I probably would've felt guilty, or at least wished things had worked out differently.
 Today, I was fully prepared to acknowledge Britney as the spoiled, self-centered brat she was.
 The bell rang and then Mrs. Campbell's lecture was over in record time.
 I even finished my assignment a good ten minutes before class was scheduled to end.
 I was absently sketching what I expected the inside of the opera house to look like, when a tap on my shoulder pulled me out of my reverie.
 "I'm so sorry, Mrs. Campbell.
 I finished early, but I should have started on one of the catch-up assignments.
 I just didn't want to get into a whole new subject with only ten minutes left."

Johnny – So?
 Jim – Since you don’t get to make the choice, it doesn’t matter much does it?
 Eugene – No, the only choice you have is whether or not to keep going forward with life after you’re born, and whether or not to have children, well assuming you can find someone to have kids with that is.
 It’s not like we had any choice in the matter.
 We have as much choice in that as we have in who our parents would be.
 We might as well be discussing when and where we were born.
 Johnny – Why are we talking about this?
 Jim – Why not?
 Johnny – Because it’s depressing.
 Eugene – Do you have something you’d rather talk about that isn’t depressing?

It didn't even take very long.
 She put a glass of juice and a cup of tea for Rick on the tray and a glass of milk for herself.
 Carefully she carried it upstairs.
 Rick was still asleep when she nudged the door open.
 She went in, set the tray on the floor, and then sat beside him.
 "Rick."
 She played with a curl on his forehead.
 He turned away from her hand, so she tickled his ear with her fingernail.
 His eyes finally opened, and he blinked up at her, smiling lazily.
 "Good morning."

He was up to about thirty Oxy pills a day and couldn’t sell enough to supply his habit.
 While he had been living on less since his home lock-down, he was really never clean during this detox.
 How was Brandon going to achieve what these cops wanted in his condition and with his new reputation as a snitch?
 I am the father, with all that that means.
 I am the man of the family, and I would do anything to protect my family but I was in unchartered territory here once again.
 What would Dino NOT do?
 What would Richard NOT do?
 I looked the undercover narcotics officer in the face and blurted, “I’ll do the bust!” I’m raising my freaking hand like I am volunteering to coach a soccer team.
 I believe firmly that the deal to bust Steve should be forgiven due to the failure on the part of the police and the complete and total fiasco that had come from the officers not doing their homework and giving Brandon the same number that Steve already knew was an undercover cop’s phone.
 They have pushed me into a corner and I only see one absurd way out.

She hadn’t gotten in a time machine, hadn’t been near a dead star, hadn’t been thinking about 2011.
 That was another thing—most of the articles talked about traveling back in time, not forward.
 How could she have been thinking about 2011 when she knew nothing about it?
 She picked up a book with a chapter on traveling through time by thought.
 Like most of the others, it was about traveling backwards, so it couldn’t explain how she got here, but now she was trying to travel backwards.
 It said you should surround yourself with objects from the period you wanted to go to and eliminate any evidence of the present and then think about a scene from the period.
 That was pretty much what she’d been doing .
 .
 .
 but she’d worn her new underwear most days.

 I don't really remember him, but I've read through his journals dozens of times.
 It seems crazy to miss what you never knew, but there are days when I really wish he were still around to give me advice.

 That and his stories."
 I smiled.

Service in activities designed to improve education, health and the environment can be of immense benefit to the country, while slowing the pace of new entrants to the workforce.
 The United States recently established AmeriCorps to strengthen and expand service and educational opportunities by providing educational grants to youth in exchange for community service in the fields of education, environment, human services and public safety.
 Participants receive a limited wage while serving, plus a post-service educational award for higher education.
 15.Pay the unemployed to work, rather than not work: The high costs of welfare programmes, the negative incentives they provide to job seekers and the harmful psychological consequences of unemployment can be mitigated by modifying welfare programmes to require that the able-bodied unemployed either train or work in exchange for welfare payments.
 The type of work given may be varied depending on both the qualifications and the training needs of the individual – for example, as assistants in child education, or care for children and the elderly, or environmental protection.
 If properly administered, these programme have proved successful in reducing costs, imparting new skills and identifying false welfare claims.
 Redirect welfare expenses for creating jobs, rather than encouraging idleness, by paying welfare recipients to carry out public service activities in return for welfare payments.
 This requires the identification of employment-intensive programmes that provide clear benefit to the community without interfering with existing business, such as the US Civilian Conservation Corps that built the US National Parks system in the 1930s.
 Expanding or upgrading the educational system would be a priority area.
 16.Make income distribution more equitable: The number of jobs available is directly related to patterns of income distribution.

Then he turned to Emily and Jason and said, “Ah, it’s great to meet the other two.” He beamed at all four of us.
 “Hi,” Emily said, looking a little freaked out.
 “So now that you’re here, are we going to get a move on or what?” “Oh of course, follow me please.” He shuffled off and disappeared behind the statue.
 Jason raised an eyebrow.
 “Where is he going?” Emily sighed.
 “There’s only one way to find out.” She walked behind the statue.
 Seth, Jason, and I followed her.
 As soon as I was on the other side, I gasped at what I saw.
 In front of me was an archway.
 Two entwined hooks were mounted on the top.

It was my Noble, young no more.
 He had been waiting here for my return.
 He was an outcast of the village; no one believed his tales of magic, the mysterious woman he claimed to meet here.
 He confessed to spending years trying to find me.
 He’d thought I was angry with him and that was why I’d not returned.
 He was afraid to leave this spot in case I were to change my mind, forgive him for whatever he’d done.
 I pushed the guilt aside when I recalled why I’d had to come here.
 For my Freya, to save her.
 What my father had done to me, to my mother, I would not let him do to her.
 I approached the grieving man and reached out to him.

He found nothing to convince him otherwise as he quickly scanned the village.
 He found many homes left wide open, yet none answered him when he called inside.
 Everywhere, staining the earth a dark crimson, there was blood.
 “It is as I feared,” he whispered to the night.
 He stood, took his bow off his shoulder, and then thoroughly searched the town.
 He found no trace of life barring a few rats that fed off the now unguarded remnants of food.
 Several homes, those with their doors smashed open, had gore smeared on their floors.
 One pained Dieredon’s heart greatly; amid a great red circle on a wooden floor laid a small, bloodstained doll.
 He said a silent prayer before moving on.
 At the edge of the town, he found many frantic tracks fleeing west.

Jim – Johnny, if what you’ve told me is correct then all we can really do is wait and hope that Eugene’s father finally dies and goes to hell.
 Liz – He’s right Johnny, there isn’t anything we can do but wait till he dies.
 Jim – We could give voodoo another shot.
 Else it’s wait for Eugene’s father to burst into flames on his own.
 Johnny – Funny.
 Jim – We don’t have many options, aside from murder and I’m not willing to go that far.
 Liz – That’s not even funny.
 Don’t joke about that.
 Jim – It wasn’t a joke.

Imeralda is an amazing young woman… beautiful, intelligent, charming and potentially a very powerful magician.
 I cherish every moment with her.” Rodregas’ heart sank at the news.
 Life with the powerful healer would be a far better one than one with his lost crusade.
 “Since you would ask me such a personal question, I have one for you.” Jordaan responded, “You are clearly struggling with what it means that Imeralda is a half Nymph, but have you thought about what is means that she is a half AElf?
 AElf maidens, when they mate with an AElf man, form a spiritual and magical bond.
 It is a bond that lasts all their lives and connects them on multiple levels as no other race is connected.
 That is why the AElves take so long to choose a life mate and almost never choose one outside of their race.
 They mate for life; not out of choice, but because that is required of their nature.” After Jordaan finished speaking he stood silently as Rodregas sat up in bed and thought on the healer’s words.
 “She is not as free with her body as most Nymphs,” he said.
 “No, she is not.

Although her auburn hair and her slim athletic build marked her as a half-breed, a woman such as she drew many an appreciative stare.
 She was not beautiful in a way that Rodregas was used to, yet the odd combination of her features captivated Rodregas.
 She was young and her innate abilities in the magical arts were thought to be immense.
 At the moment the possibility that she would ever achieve such power diminished with each step nearer the tower roof.
 Her eyes were alert, and she gazed around her for an opportunity to escape.
 The gag on her mouth and the iron bands on her arms prevented her from calling on her magic to help her.
 “Sergeant," said the other guard.
 "If we don’t hurry them, we will feel the master's wrath when we get to the top.” Rodregas grunted in agreement, “I will double your ration of food tonight and it will be fresh if you move a little faster," he said to the prisoners.
 With that hope dangling before them, both prisoners climbed faster up the stairs.
 Rodregas thought the other guard was going to laugh out loud at his comment.

In many countries, a large proportion of small enterprises are established by women and employ predominately women.
 An appropriate mix of policies focusing on access to technology, training, credit, marketing and distribution channels can substantially accelerate self-employment, particularly in the informal sector and rural areas, and among women.
 Expand services
 The service sector represents only 25 per cent of the labour force in developing countries compared with more than 67 per cent in the industrial nations.
 Contrary to common conception, services can be a major contributor to job growth even in countries at earlier stages of development.
 This sector is as amenable to stimulation by government policies as agriculture or manufacturing, and it also provides impetus for the growth of other sectors.
 Supportive policies have enabled trade, transport and other services to generate more than 50 per cent of all jobs in Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore.
 Services have produced more than half of all job growth in many other Asian nations, including private day-care centres, nursery schools and computer training institutes, which are multiplying rapidly in many countries, but can be expanded much further.
 India has adopted an innovative, low-cost, self-employment strategy to expand availability of long-distance telecommunications services by setting up small private telephone and fax centres throughout the country.
 Informal private service enterprises in construction, commerce, food catering, repair and transport have vast growth potential.

Harruq stretched, pushed away a plank of wood from the window, and climbed out.
 The sun was halfway visible, the standard noises of the city only in their infancy.
 Leaning against the shed, his eyes staring off toward the sunrise, waited Qurrah.
 “What are you doing out here?” Harruq asked.
 “Did you sense it?” Qurrah asked.
 “Sense what?”
 The smaller half-orc shook his head.
 “If you must ask then you did not, at least not directly, though I did hear you startle awake.
 Perhaps a fleeting glimpse of it…”
 “Qurrah,” Harruq said, crossing his arms and frowning at him.

And he consorts with Nymphs and Infernals, not people of the Celestial Realm.
 You do the Order a disservice to make him a Knight of the Soaring Heavens.” Van’dret’s voice was slow and reasonable sounding and he spoke not so much to the Grand Marshal as to the audience.
 “I but follow the rules of the Order as they have stood for unknown centuries, Ambassador.
 While there are many things that go into raising a squire to knighthood, the tournament is the exception.
 The rules are simple; win and you win knighthood.
 While undue bloodshed can disqualify you, a single death during the tournament is not unusual.” While the Grand Marshal spoke, he did not look at the audience.
 He looked at Van’dret and he did not look happy at the interruption.
 “But clearly he already has a greater sigil; no man can fight like that who does not have one.
 He is an impostor.
 He steals this knighthood from more deserving squires,” Van’dret said.

 "It's okay Rachel.
 I'm sorry I overreacted at finding out my attacks were public knowledge.

 She cocked her head slightly to the side and looked at me with incredibly large blue eyes that seemed older than they had a few seconds before.
 "It really bothers you that everyone knows?"
 I shrugged uncomfortably.
 "I guess maybe it shouldn't, but it does.
 Nobody likes to be ridiculed, but it's even more than that.

 She'd covered her face with her hands and was sobbing.

 Rick put his key in the ignition but then turned to look helplessly at the terrified girl.

A viable solution requires concerted and coordinated activity by government, industry and agriculture at a time when each is operating in isolation from the others.
 The main elements of a viable plan to reduce losses for foodgrains, vegetables and potatoes have been proposed by a Dutch cooperative agri-business firm.
 The aim of the plan is to reduce food imports to zero and eliminate food shortages within three to five years.
 The plan requires acquisition of foreign production and storage technology, but depends only marginally on import of equipment, most of which can be manufactured in domestic defence facilities.
 The hard currency requirement is minimal.
 But the plan does re quire a leading role by government and financial assistance to farms.
 In order to be effective, it needs to be supported by a massive public education campaign on use of new technology to eradicate crop losses combined with demonstration plots on both large-scale and small private farms throughout the country.
 The Commission recommends immediate implementation of the plan with the objective of improving the agricultural economy, increasing the food supply and completely eliminating dependence on food imports.
 4.Study benefits of economic union: Of the estimated 50 per cent fall in GDP among the republics of the former Soviet Union, approximately half can be attributed to the break-up of the economic union.
 Restoration of a common economic space – which is being criticized internationally as a surrender of sovereignty to Russia at a time when both Western Europe and North America are striving for closer economic union – could immediately restore most of that lost output.

It wasn't right for a girl to look at another girl like that.
 Like she couldn't wait to watch Vincent do all kinds of terrible things.
 "Payback sucks, doesn't it?"
 Jasmin's complete stillness was an eerie counterpoint to the waves of power still beating at me.
 I somehow knew she was just seconds away from springing when the sound of running footsteps caused all three to turn.
 Alec appeared around the corner, followed by Isaac, just a split second before Brandon sauntered into view from the opposite direction.
 The tingly feeling grew exponentially more powerful with so many more shape shifters present.
 Rubbing my arms did nothing to ward off the feeling that entire colonies of insects were skittering across my skin.
 Mr. Rindell's appearance forestalled what I'd been sure would turn into a full-blown fight.
 He sized up the situation with the canny eye of an educator who'd seen more fights over his career than most gang leaders.

No one can control animals.” She cocked an eyebrow at me speculatively.
 “But—” “Okay, well, sure, you can lead an animal.
 You can turn your horse and guide him on the path, but that is simply pushing their heads and encouraging them with the click of your heels.
 You can’t make them choose to take you; it just doesn’t work that way.
 You can’t get into an animal’s mind and make them behave the way you want them to.” “But the dogs… wolves… follow them.
 They had them do a demonstration and—” “No, Frey.
 The wolves do not follow the elves.
 The wolves protect them by choice.” “By choice?” “Yes.
 And I have seen them tear an elf apart as quickly as defend them.” I shivered.
 “Rhys and Rider were saved by the wolves once.

It is a settled, stable, secure condition which thrives on a foundation of political maturity, social freedom and economic well-being.
 A world in which all major military powers – with the present exclusion of China – have democratic governments removes the ideological basis and political pressure for confrontation between states.
 If it is maintained, the adoption of democratic forms of government by the nations of Eastern Europe and the developing world will help ensure peaceful relations between states, which is the most fundamental precondition for accelerated economic development.
 The marriage of democracy and disarmament can transform the world – abolishing wars, eliminating nuclear arsenals, liberating hundreds of billions of dollars for building a better common future.
 In economic terms, the shift to democratic government presents an opportunity for more rapid development in these countries.
 During the post-war period of technology-driven industrialization, there is a strong correlation between a representative form of government and rapid economic development.
 This relationship is reciprocal.
 In democratic countries freedom of expression and exposure to independent media awaken people to expectation of a better life and encourage them to take initiatives that lead to prosperity.
 At the same time, the democratic tendency is strengthened substantially by rising standards of living.
 As democracies distribute political power, they also tend to distribute the benefits of science, technology, information and education, which are the essential building blocks of economic development.

“Please, Freya, try.” All I could do was nod.
 And then he stood and walked away.
 I sat unmoving for a moment, and then finally glanced at the group.
 They were deeply involved in their conversations, seemingly unaware of the encounter that had my heart in my throat.
 I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, attempting to “move about” in my mind.
 It was completely frustrating.
 Fuzzy, wrong.
 Nothing worked.
 None of it connected the way it should have.
 It made me angry and tired and the maddening fight against it gained me nothing but a buzzing headache.

That was the question that was making me steam.
 “Seth out with it!” I didn’t know why I shouted.
 I startled him and he looked up at me.
 “What do you mean, Jazell?” “I mean tell me what you’re hiding!” I yelled at him.
 He stood up, “I’m not hiding anything.” His voice was level but it shook slightly.
 I stepped towards him and gave him a hard shove.
 He stumbled back and fell on the ground.
 He looked up at me, waiting for what I would do next.
 “Why are you keeping a secret from me?” I repeated, my voice as cold as an icicle.
 Seth didn’t answer me, instead he did the most cowardly and annoying thing you can do.

“Loose who?” “We’ll explain later!” I said and ran after Seth.
 “Right now we have to move!” We dashed up the hill in the direction the monsters were going.
 When we reached the top, Seth stopped and stared down.
 Emily and Jason looked confused but joined us.
 We looked down at the ground and I gasped as I saw all the monsters gather around in a semi-circle, waiting.
 “What are they waiting for?” Emily asked in a hushed voice.
 Seth squinted down.
 “I don’t want to know.” “Do you think it could…?” I asked.
 “Let’s hope not,” Seth interrupted me.
 Oh course; being ourselves, we don’t have any luck at all.

He was perfect.
 A boy.
 My boy.
 Brandon.
 And he had all his fingers and all his toes, and he let out a bellow so excruciating it could curdle milk.
 Many changes, challenges and compromises in our marriage would soon follow.
 Many difficult times required me to recall the moment I first saw Lisa.
 A second son, Bryce, was added to our family two years later.
 I have tried to explain to my friends with no children yet that having children changes everything suddenly.
 Every day, sometimes every second, delivers a new challenge.

They'd secretly talk about all of the people they knew who'd lost family members and been okay after a few weeks, or a couple of months.
 How even at their worst, those friends hadn't collapsed at the mention of their departed loved ones.
 My pulse was already almost twice as fast as normal, and the room was just starting to wobble from side to side.
 Rachel was saying something, but I couldn't really hear her.
 The void was gaping below me, when something grabbed my shoulder and shook me surprisingly hard.
 I opened my eyes to see Rachel looking at me.
 "I'm sorry I had to do that, Adriana, but you need to hear what I have to say."
 Half of me wanted to be angry, but the other half just wanted to collapse into the void.
 Force of habit won over anger and I passively let my defenses crumble, but apparently being shocked out of a collapse functioned much the same as having just come out of an attack.
 For the next few seconds at least I was safe, could think about anything I wanted without fear of the repercussions.

Britney quickly used up her allotment of complaints, and then subsided into silence as she led the way to an out-of-the-way corner of the old school.
 I'd noticed Britney liked to position herself so she was closest to the middle of the hall.
 Admittedly, dodging all the people trying to get into their lockers wasn't much fun, but I suspected her real motivation was a desire to ensure she could see and be seen, which was much more easily accomplished by relegating me to the outside position.
 Normally I'd have just viewed her theatrics with amusement, but it'd been a long day and I wasn't in the mood.
 If I'd known for sure where we were heading, I'd have considered cutting her off, even with all of the probable fallout, but I didn't.
 Instead I just sighed, followed her around a corner, and collided with six-plus feet of muscled goodness packaged in a white polo shirt that looked worryingly familiar.
 Brandon caught me as I rebounded from him, easily stopping my momentum before I could stumble into a locker.
 "We'd better be careful; I'm starting to sense a trend."
 I wanted to say something equally witty, but his shirt did wonderful, probably illegal things to his gray eyes, and his perfectly straight teeth were parted in a friendly grin that couldn't possibly be meant for me.
 I managed a feeble grin before the silence stretched too far towards becoming uncomfortable, but it was a pathetic attempt.

Holding in a curse, he headed to the royal stables.
 He needed to speak with Dieredon and personally break the terrible news.
 !
 [section break](break.png)
 Qurrah smirked as the guard captain hurried away.
 “Elves banned,” he said to his brother.
 “Amusing, though unnecessary.
 Only handfuls live within these walls, and they are just diplomats and messengers.
 Our king is a spiteful, paranoid one.”
 “Not my king,” Harruq muttered loud as he dared.

All three tried to engage without being put at risk, much like men prodding a bull.
 Of course, the result was similar.
 The bull got madder.
 “If you’re gonna fight me, fight me!” he yelled.
 He ignored several strikes, accepting the cuts so he could close the distance between him and his opponent.
 The sound of steel was quick and brutal, but after the humiliation against Dieredon, Harruq felt as if his opponent moved through sand.
 At the end of three seconds, both of his blades had found flesh.
 The guard fell at his feet, bleeding from a severed arm and a gutted belly.
 Soaked in blood, Harruq turned to the remaining guards and bellowed like the mad beast he was.
 The remaining two facing him were trained well.

She was reclined, her bare legs showing where the material of her skirt was pulled to the side.
 When I looked up, she resituated herself, leaning toward Steed and talking low about some nonsense.
 She walked her fingers up his chest as she talked, glancing at me for a reaction.
 She was trying to make me jealous.
 I was suddenly furious.
 She’d poisoned me and now this.
 I wanted to burn her right then and there.
 I caught Chevelle’s expression as I glared at her.
 He had seen what she was doing, knew her motives most likely, but I could tell he thought it had worked.
 He thought I was jealous.

 Jim – Ok, I just make it all up as I go along.

The door was partially open when I reached Junnie’s house, so I peeked my head in and called for her.
 When she didn’t answer, I slipped in to check the back room.
 As I walked through the sparsely decorated living area, I passed a carved mirror on the wall and noticed something off in my reflection.
 I knew I was flushed, I could feel the frustration and worry, but I stopped to get a closer look.
 There was something not right with my complexion, but what was really off was just above my face.
 I squinted, leaning toward the mirror as my hands reached up of their own accord.
 The first quarter inch of my hair was blackened.
 I parted my hair in a different area and then again, but the base of my hair was dark over my entire scalp.
 My fingers began to tremble against my skin; I could come up with no plausible explanation for the change.
 “Junnie,” I called out again.

What’s it feel like there?” “You know when you’re away from home and no matter how great a time you’re having, you’re still a bit uneasy, so when you get home you always feel relieved?
 You unwind, your heart slows.
 Nothing can hurt you now.
 That’s how it felt.” “You’re a lucky guy,” Eric said, in a more wistful tone than I had ever heard him use.
 Freedom
 Driving through Los Angeles, thinking is dangerous.
 An instant of distraction can get you killed.
 I turn off the I-pod and for some moments attend to driving.
 But I can’t give up remembering Eric, and memories I left behind long ago appear.
 I recall that I wrote my first complete story at Eric’s house.

He didn’t know the boy’s name or why he had wandered into the forest.
 The bloodied corpse was sprawled across the knotted roots of a tree, its innards spilled through a massive gash from shoulder to waist.
 The eyes remained open, their young innocence spoiled by a lingering look of horror.
 _You’re an orc, aren’t you?_
 Harruq snarled and shook his head.
 He shouldn’t have spoken to him.
 Shouldn’t have let him ask questions.
 The last of his adrenaline faded as images of the child’s quivering lips and trembling hands haunted his vision.
 “Half,” Harruq whispered as he wiped blood from his swords onto the grass.
 “Only half.”

But whether he believes or not, Cliff has gotten well blessed since our evening with Billy Graham.
 He has four wonderful kids, and Toni, who is one of those rarest of people who appear to grow brighter, stronger, and more beautiful every year.
 Cliff and Billy's dad, Cliff Senior, invited me to dinner not many years ago.
 The evening became an in vino veritas experience.
 After some cups, he said, “Ken, you should know it was me that hounded my son into serving in Vietnam.” I held back from saying, Yeah, I know.
 “So he goes over there, fighting in a war that was all wrong, and he saw things nobody should have to.
 He comes back drinking hard.
 And then, thank God, he met Toni.” The man from whom Cliff and Bill Torrey inherited their reserved and stoic characters snuffed and wiped his eyes.
 “I’ll tell you, that girl saved my son’s life.
 She dressed him down when he needed it, kicked him out when she knew it was best, and took him back as soon as he deserved it.

“Damn it all!” Antonil shouted, slamming his mailed fist into the wall.
 Still shaking his head, he stormed back to the gate, muttering curses.
 “What was that all about?” Harruq asked.
 “King Vaelor asked for aid and the elves declined,” Qurrah answered, chuckling.
 “The King’s pride will not take too kindly to that.”
 “He and his pride can suck a rotten egg,” Harruq said.
 “Hurry or we’ll miss the battle.”
 He pulled his brother down the alley to where a tall, crumbled house leaned near the wall.
 “Onto my shoulders,” Harruq suggested, grabbing Qurrah’s knees and hoisting him high.
 Qurrah latched onto the roof, paused, and then stepped onto Harruq’s shoulders.

Seth looked over his shoulder, his eyes twinkling in amusement.
 “Am I too fast for you, Jazell?” “No way,” I huffed.
 “I just need to catch my breath.” I stood up and looked around.
 The hill was pretty high and I could see better.
 The land was hill after hill, tree after tree.
 It didn’t seem to end.
 “Hey, I’m king of the hill,” Seth joked and reached for the sky.
 I walked over and pushed him gently.
 He fell backward on his butt and I laughed.
 “More like goof of the hill.” He stuck his tongue out.

I finally oriented myself enough to realize that the warm, solid surface my back was resting against wasn't a wall.
 "I'm sorry.
 It was a nightmare."
 My voice came out raw and scratchy, like I'd been talking for hours, or possibly just screaming for the last minute or so.
 I wanted to tell him about what had happened, but now that I was awake my fears felt foolish.
 I tried to distract myself by looking around, and then felt my face heat up as I realized I'd fallen asleep in Alec's room.
 "I'm so sorry, Alec.
 Donovan and Rachel told me you had copies of our textbooks in here.
 I was studying and must have fallen asleep.
 Please don't think..." I felt tears start to gather at the corner of my eyes, but there wasn't any way to tell whether they were attributable to simple terror, acute embarrassment, or a combination of the two.

 “We will not have to fall back so far,” Felewen disagreed.
 “They have scattered about our town.

 Both bowed politely.
 “Never could we have used a mage’s power more than now,” one said.

His eyes widened and he looked down at the ground below, obviously trying to imagine what it had looked like.
 I had seen it and I was seriously scarred for my life.
 “You sure?” he asked.
 “You know that this means that Kojas was here, so he can’t be too far away.” “Don’t get your hopes up.
 I saw him once and I have no intention of being near him anytime soon.” He sat on the edge, the wind tossing around his hair.
 It was going to be seriously wind-blown later.
 I sat down next to him and I was trying to forget the dwarf’s mangled body.
 I shook and hugged myself.
 “Are you cold?” he asked, his voice full of concern.
 I just shrugged and squeezed my eyes shut.

“I am more than pleased with them.”
 “You will need to keep a fresh supply of bones with you,” Velixar said, reaching into his pouch.
 “Take these for now until you can obtain more.”
 Qurrah accepted the bones, stashing them into a small pocket he had sewn onto his robe.
 A silence fell over the two as far away a wolf howled.
 “I wonder,” Velixar said, gazing in the direction of the howl.
 “Do you have a brother?”
 Qurrah shifted his weight a bit.
 “Why do you ask?”
 Velixar looked up to the moon and stared as he spoke.

The trap was clever, but the other wolves didn't know the terrain well enough.
 I let my beast bubble up from the corner of my being where I usually kept it chained.
 Between one moment and the next, I went from running on four legs to two.
 As my transformation ended, a six-foot tower of muscle and claws sprang from the shadows.
 I ducked Vincent's first blow and retaliated with a gash that opened one side of his chest nearly down to the bone.
 A dark-furred form leaped at Jasmin, but the other wolf mistimed the spring.
 Most of the other pack didn't appreciate just how nimble she was.
 Jasmin dodged to one side and then the two of them were circling, looking for an opening.
 Vincent, the other hybrid, attacked with the strength and fury that'd earned him the position of second in his pack, but he hadn't been expecting to face me in this form.
 As a wolf I weighed in at a solid two hundred pounds, but would've still given up more than a hundred pounds to him.

Anyone built like that should be ugly to keep things in balance.
 Not him.
 His square jaw and even features were nothing less than perfection.
 If he ever chose to model, the editors of every major fashion magazine would have pulled out all the stops to land the contract for his debut appearance.
 The whole issue would have to be pictures of him though.
 No amount of airbrushing would suffice to allow other men to ever share the same magazine with him.
 I expected to begin hyperventilating any second, but my lungs seemed frozen.
 My body should have been screaming for oxygen.
 Instead every part of me was screaming for more of that divine face.
 He'd been looking to his left; I pried my gaze away from his profile just long enough to take in a casual tangle of dark, curly hair, and then he was turning towards me.

Just trust me a little."
 She didn't want to.
 But he was right--she didn't know how to get home.
 Slowly she rose, not taking the hand he extended but following him inside.
 "This is a microwave oven," he told her, patting a white and brown box.
 "It cooks things really fast--it can heat something like rice in less than a minute."
 When he saw her incredulous stare, he opened the refrigerator and took out a bowl of mixed vegetables.
 "Feel."
 She touched the cold food.
 "How does the box work?"

 “Of course not.

 We will resume, just this time amid the darkness.”
 Harruq nodded, obviously uneasy.
 “Hey brother?”
 “Yes Harruq?”
 “Are you sure what we’re doing isn’t wrong?” He twiddled his fingers, suddenly embarrassed.
 “I mean…‌ they’re children.”

“Greetings, Ahrqur,” Qurrah said.
 “Remember us, the incompetent thieves?”
 The spirit glared harder.
 “Did his tongue die with him?” Harruq asked.
 “I haven’t told him he can speak yet,” Qurrah responded.
 His eyes flicked back from Harruq to the spirit.
 “You may talk, spirit, but keep it quiet.”
 “You take my life, and now you dare keep me from eternity?” the spirit moaned.
 “For what reason do you torment me?
 I have never harmed you, never said a cursing word, but now this?”

 I expected Rachel to back down as soon as she realized he was spoiling for a fight, but if anything she looked more determined.
 It was hard to believe this was the same person I'd had to rescue from Cassie so recently.
 I stopped Rachel just before she could put the impressive lungful of air she'd just taken in to whatever use she'd planned.
 "It's okay.
 I'm better.
 The lane's dusty and exercise would do me good."
 She hesitated, obviously torn, but my fumbling fingers finally found the unfamiliar door release and I made the decision for her.

We never received a request for ransom."
 "I don't know.
 Um, Mother, could we have some cocoa?"
 Mrs. Tranton hugged her daughter.
 "You could ask us for the world right now, and we'd get it for you."
 Marie laughed.
 "Just cocoa, thanks."
 They sat at the table drinking coffee and cocoa while they waited for Louise to serve them breakfast.
 "What's the first thing you want to do now that you're home?"
 Mrs. Tranton asked.

"No, not all of them."
 It was getting harder and harder to string thoughts together in a comprehensible manner.
 "Sounds fulfilling.
 Busy, but fulfilling."
 Alec waited so long to respond that I nearly drifted off.
 "It's always seemed fulfilling.
 At least until recently."
 I wanted to know what he meant, but couldn't muster the willpower.
 I already felt myself starting to drift away.
 Even the feeling of him caressing my check again wasn't enough to bring me all the way back to full alertness.

Creole, you do the research, man, find out if Buddy’s still with us (laughs) and make me sound sensible here, dig?
 I want this to have some semblance of significance  Some sense of time.
 If I’ve got stuff out of sequence, put in stuff that I couldn’t have known at that time, you straighten it out, right?
 You make it into the story of my life.
 You’re the man, you’re the storyteller.
 I leave it all in your capable hands.
 This is just a collection of ramblings, right?
 Hey, man, what are you gonna do with this shit?
 It suddenly occurred to me, what if this doesn’t make sense?
 But, you’ll do it, right?

 So, riff, give me your best tale.
 BG:  	I started out as a child.
 (laughs)
 CM: 	What?
 BG: 	 Bill Cosby.
 Never mind.
 Like Richard Nixon, I was born in a house my father built, a basement he poured.
 A sandlot diamond behind the house where I got a splinter once in my rear.
 The bigger boys laughed.

If you were mine--"   He stopped, realizing how agitated he was getting and how chagrined Marie looked.
 "I'm sorry," he told her.
 "I didn't mean to get so excited.
 I just really care about you, and I don't want you to mistake infatuation for love and end up hurt."
 They finished their yogurt in silence.
 Rick threw their napkins away, and they began wandering toward the mall exit.
 "I'm sorry, Marie," he repeated.
 "It's really none of my business."
 She was quiet for a few moments.
 Glancing up at him, she asked, "Would you really spend every evening with me if-if I were .

This is different.
 Velixar has given us the power and privilege to do what we were always meant to do.
 I need you to embrace this.
 Velixar’s reason is the only reason we need, that we will ever need.
 It is in our blood, our orcish blood, and that is a weight even your muscles cannot hold back.
 We are killers, murderers, butchers, now granted purpose within that.
 That is our fate.
 That is our reason.
 Do you understand?”
 Harruq’s fingers traced the hilts of his new swords.

"No.
 I-I can't.
 My choice was to stay with him and never come home again or come home and never see him again."
 Mrs. Tranton couldn't suppress a sigh of relief as she hugged her daughter.
 "I'm sorry you can't have both, darling.
 But I'm so glad to have you home again."
 Marie went to her room to change clothes and lie down.
 What an emotion-packed day.
 She'd been reunited with her family, learned that her father and brother had reconciled, broken up with Davis, and spent an entire weekday morning with her father.
 She smiled as she reached into her closet for a housedress.

“Come on, Qurrah.
 I’m getting hungry,” Harruq said as he trudged off, his hands at his sides grabbing the air where his swords no longer were.
 !
 [section break](break.png)
 The two brothers lived in the poorest part of town, sheltered in an old building long abandoned.
 When they had first arrived, several homeless men claimed it as their own.
 Harruq had slit their throats when they slept and then Qurrah worked his art.
 The few vagabonds left in the city quickly learned to avoid the worn building marked by holes in its roof and long shadows that lingered no matter where the sun shone.
 Harruq shoved open the door and then halted as he breathed in the stuffy air.
 “Nothing like home, eh?” he said.

CM: 	No, I didn’t know that.
 BG:  	Oh, yeah.
 That’s the story, anyway,  He turned away from the engineer in the studio there and faced the corner, like Little Jack Horner—as a matter of fact, I almost called this “Little Jack Horner,” but it didn’t make much sense.
 Anyway, everyone thought the poor guy was just shy, or hiding his idiosyncratic playing style—which may be partly true—but the real reason, so I’ve read, is that he could get an interesting “bounce” from the corner, sort of double-tracking his voice before that was ever heard of.
 So, I laid it down first just on this cassette player—really—and then dumped it to a 16-track, played through a little reverb amp I had at the house.
 Stayed up all night doing that fucker.
 It was a full moon, I remember.
 It was beautiful.
 And at dawn, I brought it to Lorelei and said, baby, this is as good as Buddy gets.
 Is this interesting?

Still smiling, I looked back to the stone, but it had returned to its uninteresting round shape.
 Chevelle answered my unspoken question.
 “Yes, it’s… tricky.” He smiled a little at using Steed’s word.
 “You can’t change something’s makeup, but you can change the way it appears.
 You can move it, but only if you’re near.
 You can stop someone’s heart, but you can’t make them feel happy about it.” He hesitated after that last part, contemplating, and then continued, “You can manipulate the elements, move water, draw it from the ground, but you cannot easily make it appear from nothing… though one can usually collect moisture from the air.
 Fire is easier.
 It spreads so fast.
 You can pull a small spark from anywhere to create a flame, fueled by the air and…” He trailed off as I leaned closer to him, listening intently.
 Chevelle looked into my eyes, words forgotten.

The elf whirled, sensing the incoming invisible blow.
 Only a tiny part hit his shoulder, immediately encasing it in ice.
 Then Harruq was upon him, slashing recklessly.
 Ahrqur batted his sword left and right, then jumped as Harruq swung back in a scissor-cut that should have shredded his waist.
 The elf landed atop one of his couches, balancing with ease.
 “What reason do you have to kill me?” the elf asked.
 “Are you here for money?
 I could pay you twice the pittance you work for.”
 “Just shut up,” Harruq said, hurling Salvation across the room.
 Ahrqur leapt again.

That brought back something Ruby had said.
 Chevelle would have to practice the unbinding spell on someone else first.
 Would he use one of our group?
 And if the spell went wrong?
 I tested the spell on Rain last night.
 I’m not sure what went amiss, but she convulsed for hours before she fell into a sleep.
 She finally rose late this morning, but she couldn’t remember who she was and she kept scratching at her face until it bled.
 At least she’ll not be able to tell anyone I did it.
 I’ll have to catch another servant tonight.
 No, I had a feeling he’d not be using one of our group.

I kept telling her I wasn't interested and that she'd just have to do the work.
 Surprisingly enough, once she accepted that, she actually buckled down.
 It only took another ten minutes to explain the Pythagorean theory to her.
 By the time I stood up from Jackie's desk, there were only four of us left.
 Britney was staring sullenly at her book.
 I thought about going over and seeing if she needed any help, but after helping Jackie I was feeling pretty good.
 I turned and headed back to my desk, smiling at Rachel as I passed.
 "Adri, do you have a sec?"
 The deadly nickname.
 Apparently I'd only thought I was doing better.

Such a mechanism, so long as it is inclusive, would provide a real and viable alternative to national militarization, whether or not it was constituted by or within the UN system.
 The success of NATO in maintaining peaceful relations among the democratic states of Western Europe and North America for more than half a century is a viable model which is limited primarily by the exclusivity of its membership.
 The recent measures taken by the European Union to constitute a European Army are evidence of the practicality of establishing a similar mechanism open to all nations.
 The unfortunate situation now witnessed in Iraq could have been avoided, if ICPF’s plea for a World Peace Army had been heeded.
 Eradicating the Roots of Terrorism: Terrorism is not new to the world, but with the withdrawal of national rivalries between East and West, violence by non-nation states has increased in intensity and is viewed as a far greater security concern by the entire world.
 This has spurred an unprecedented international effort to control and suppress terrorist activity.
 But there is little hope of abolishing this menace without simultaneously comprehending and addressing the root causes of terrorism in the world today.
 In a sense, the human urge for violence has neither increased nor decreased.
 It has simply shifted the field of expression from confrontation between nation states to confrontation between powerful governments and disenchanted, disenfranchised groups of individuals who respond to the application of superior power by nation states with the application of indiscriminate violence against the public-at-large.
 Terrorism thrives in the absence of effective democratic institutions to give voice to the will of its citizens.

"No thanks--I have a dishwasher."
 "A maid?"
 "No."
 He chuckled.
 "Watch."
 He quickly loaded the dishwasher, poured in the soap, and turned it on.
 "The door is locked, and hot water will blast the dishes."
 She blinked.
 "How?"
 He laughed.

I skimmed through Alec's answer and felt my anger joined by surprise and just the slightest touch of admiration.
 He struck on exactly the same theory as I had, and done at least as good of job explaining it.
 Maybe even better considering that he took the time to review some of the underlying theory we'd been taught in class.
 I'd just jumped right into the answer.
 "You're right.
 You never even came to class, and you got the right answer.
 Did you cheat?
 Is the answer to this problem out there somewhere on the Internet?"
 Alec's face tightened with something I was willing to bet was anger.
 "No, I didn't cheat.

It overlooked the Charles River, and when they left the club, they strolled along the river.
 It was a warm, clear April evening, a night right out of a romance novel.
 "Thank you, Davis," Marie said, squeezing his arm.
 "For what?"
 "For this evening.
 It's been perfect."
 "I think so too.
 Well, almost."
 "Almost?"
 He stopped, turning to face her.

 Tom grinned at his favorite cousin.
 She smiled at him.

Measures of this type will result in substantially increased demand for agricultural products from developing countries, the first step in an upward spiral of global economic growth that will stimulate industrial exports and job growth in both East and West.
 2.Global, environmentally sustainable Green Revolution.
 The term 'Green Revolution' has been praised for its positive impact on crop productivity and criticized for its likely adverse effects on the environment and social equity.
 It is often overlooked that one of the most beneficial consequences of the Green Revolution has been its 'forest-saving' nature.
 If agricultural production had not been increased through higher productivity, more forest land would have been diverted to annual cropping.
 India alone would have needed at least 50 million hectares of additional land to produce the wheat and rice it now produces, if average yields had remained at pre-Green Revolution levels.
 It is, therefore, important that the concept of higher productivity per unit of land, water, time, energy, labour and capital be extended to all farming systems and all regions.
 Most developing countries will have no option but to produce more food and agricultural commodities from less land and water in the twenty-first century.
 The challenge lies in accomplishing this in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner.
 The FAO should launch a co ordinated international effort to extend the principles and strategies of the Green Revolution to eradicate global food shortages within a decade.

I'd been nearly unconscious from the pain, so I didn't remember any of what had happened next, but Alec had reluctantly filled in most of the details.
 Apparently the stress of the fight had finally awakened his potential, and his power was a real humdinger.
 The metaphysical hurricane that'd knocked me to the ground had actually been Alec pulling power from all of the shape shifters and humans in the area.
 The experience had been nearly as overwhelming for Alec as it had been for the rest of us.
 He'd recovered just in time to find Brandon grimly pulling himself along on all fours.
 Luckily Alec had recovered more quickly, and once Brandon was deprived of the strength and speed his power had bestowed upon him, Alec had been more than a match for him, even wounded and exhausted.
 Brandon's end had been quick, and if Alec hadn't realized my blood was slowly leaking out onto the ground, the rest of Brandon's pack would've likewise been quickly sorted out.
 Instead, Alec had stumbled over, shifted back to human form, and got the bleeding slowed to a point where I wasn't in imminent danger of death.
 Unfortunately that'd been all the delay Brandon's pack had needed to make a run for it.
 Isaac, James and Jasmin were trying to track down the worst of the lot, the ones who'd taken an active part in Brandon's atrocities, but it was slow going.

As crazy as it sounds, Alec's pack needs me."
 I mentally reached around for something similar and then finally nodded.
 "I guess I can understand that.
 My mom would have a hard time functioning without me, so I try to do the best I can at taking care of her."
 Rachel's smile lit the room up.
 "That's it exactly.
 Anyways, I mostly just wanted to stop by and see if us girls can take you shopping tomorrow."
 The non sequitur really threw me for a loop.
 "I left my money at home.
 I'm not much of a shopper anyways."

The week went by quickly.
 Marie always began the day with a walk in the garden, and Rick always hugged her and dried her tears when she returned.
 When he left for work, she'd exercise and watch movies he'd rented for her and clean the house with the supplies she'd discovered.
 In the evenings they'd eat and talk and watch TV, but he promised to take her to the shore Saturday.
 "The first thing we have to do is buy you a bathing suit," Rick told Marie as they strolled through the mall after dinner Friday evening.
 "Be prepared, OK?
 I think you'll find them a little immodest."
 She tried to prepare herself, but she was shocked by the outfits she was shown.
 The material was thin, and they all had plunging necklines, and some were cut so that the edge of the leg hole was almost as high as the arm hole.
 But she managed to find two, one red and one black with pink flowers, that were less shocking than the others and took them to the dressing room.

8.Extend basic education: A distinguishing feature of the East Asian countries has been their emphasis during the early stage of industrialization on primary and secondary education, especially in rural areas.
 This strategy increases the productivity of the mass of the workforce, helps promote income equality, consumer spending power and broad support for high growth and pro-business policies.
 Raise the educational qualifications of the workforce to the level pertaining in more economically advanced nations.
 Place particular emphasis on primary and secondary education, rural education and education of young girls.
 9.Disseminate information: Encourage the establishment of new institutions, programmes and systems to speed and extend the dissemination of practically useful information as a powerful catalyst for more rapid social progress.
 Encourage a national climate of open-mindedness to foreign ideas, influences and success stories.
 10.Increase the velocity of money and other transactions: Increase the speed of commercial transactions, especially money flows, in the economy by streamlining government and banking procedures, ensuring rapid utilization of funds by all government agencies, setting strict limits on the time taken for bank transfers, introducing agencies for credit verification and collection of unpaid bills, and improving the telecommunications infrastructure.
 11.Revamp higher education: Educational systems which 'manufacture graduates' compound the problem rather than alleviating it.
 The problem of the educated unemployed is not so much the amount of education they receive, but the type of knowledge and attitudes imparted.
 Reorient the educational curriculum at all levels, especially higher education, to impart the knowledge and attitudes needed to promote self-employment and entrepreneur ship rather than salaried employment.

As always with Alec's paintings, it took me a second before I could shift my perspective enough to translate the beautiful formations of light into something I could tie to the drab, dreary world I inhabited.
 It was the same grotto where we now stood.
 The warm glow from the climbing ivory and roses formed a backdrop awash in the silvery light of a full moon.
 Just visible off to one side was the pool, alive with enough microscopic life to give it a pale glow of its own to compliment the off-center reflection of a hundred tiny lights.
 A few seconds later I finally recognized that the subject of the piece was a female, reaching out towards the point of view with glowing hands.
 "She's beautiful.
 It's how I always imagined an angel would appear."
 Alec was silent for so long I finally tore my gaze from his masterpiece long enough to find that he was staring at me with surprise.
 "It's you, Adri.
 Of course it's beautiful."

I'd starve to death before anyone found me."
 Donovan's laugh was surprisingly relaxed.
 I'd only ever seen him with a serious, if respectful expression.
 Even Rachel's frequent teasing hadn't ever managed to crack his 'working face'.
 "I hardly think that would be the case.
 While you may very well have lost your way, it would have been a small matter for one of the others to track you down.
 You have, if I may say so, a very distinctive smell.
 It reminds me of a type of sage brush that hasn't grown here in quite some time."
 His sigh was more felt than heard, and it put me in mind of mountains, redwoods, and other ancient things.
 "Donovan, can I ask you a question?"

It was interesting what she said, but he was not sure why she was bringing it up at this time.
 “Only the Immortalist have ever taken on the essence of a Celestial Beast as they get ready to become gods,” Imeralda continued.
 Her eyes wandering around the arena, waiting.
 Her voice had a casual quality, but Rodregas sensed she thought this very important.
 “When Doi’van sees you, he thinks of you as one of the blood, a noble in fact, if not by birth.
 Most of the men and women in this circle are that; faster, stronger because they descend from a Celestial god.
 But you are not that.
 The Celestial Beasts all represent something.” She paused, looking at him for the first time.
 “What does The Lion represent, Rodregas?” she asked.
 Rodregas was silent for a moment and then said, “Strength, the Hunter, and Protector of the Pride.” He spoke words that he knew he had learned as a child at temple.

“Yes,” he said at last.
 “I’ve killed.”
 He eyed Aurelia, desperately wishing to know what she thought yet unable to figure out why he even cared.
 He thought he saw pity in her eyes, perhaps compassion.
 But there was a hardness there, a doubting that made him wonder just how much of him she truly knew.
 “Tell me of the first time,” she said.
 He shook his head.
 “Not today.
 Maybe some other session, if I feel I can.”
 They both stood, Aurelia stepping away while Harruq stretched and popped his back.

The flames that he had called forth to steal the AElfin maiden’s magical abilities now burned him.
 The timing had been near impossible.
 The spell calling forth the flames of creation could only burn one life.
 But the timing was perfect; Ravenhurr called forth the fire, and then he was in it.
 The flames consumed his body in seconds, and flaring from the circle went the multi-colored energy of his magic, the one element that the circle was designed to protect from the flames.
 His magic power shot out of the circle and started orbiting the larger circle.
 He was completely gone.
 Rodregas excitedly thought, “Victory!” He had done it.
 He had killed the Immortalist Sorcerer Ravenhurr.
 The multi-colored energy of his magic swirled around the outer circle and was sucked into the empty vessel of the young man.

“A marvelous spell,” the half-orc gasped, fighting away a momentary wave of dizziness.
 He closed his eyes and attuned his mind to the village.
 A stench of fear trailed west.
 Women and children, all of them panicked and confused.
 “Harruq, they flee west,” Qurrah whispered, magically enhancing his voice using a spell Velixar had taught him.
 His quiet words flooded the town, audible by all yet still sounding like a whisper.
 The fleeing residents of the town heard and were terrified.
 His brother heard and obeyed.
 The two met at the edge of town.
 They saw scattered groups of families not far in the distance.

Maybe the information about the rest of her life wouldn't appear until she returned.
 And maybe she wouldn’t marry Davis when she returned.
 What she did here might have an impact on how her life progressed in the past.
 Rick closed his eyes.
 He wasn't used to theoretical reasoning.
 But there was one thing he was sure of: that sweet girl asleep in the next bedroom wasn't going to return to a life of misery if he could help it.
 CHAPTER FIVE
 Marie woke up with a pounding heart.
 She wanted to go home--she had to get out to the garden right away.
 Jumping out of bed, she dressed as quickly as she could and ran downstairs and into the garden.

I wasn’t as worried about the financial price at this point, but rather the thought of owing Thomas after all that he had perpetrated against us was almost as unpalatable as Brandon’s Oxy addiction.
 This was all unchartered territory.
 It was all uncomfortable.
 It all sucked big time.
 My pride would take a back seat to Brandon’s needs.
 His drug problem was more important than the grudge I was holding over my brother’s drug-induced antics.
 I felt like I was selling out.
 But somewhere in my heart I guess I had always hoped that Thomas and I would mend the damage between us.
 That one day I could forgive.
 That one day our families would spend a holiday together, and that holiday would lead to another and eventually things would be as normal as they could be.

I have to work late because of the surprise.
 I have quite a bit of vacation time coming, and I thought I'd take some next week.
 Since I'm not giving much notice, I have a lot of things I have to take care of tomorrow."
 If a vacation was the surprise, it must include her, but she didn't want to make any assumptions.
 "What plans have you made for your vacation?"
 "I thought we'd spend Saturday shopping for whatever you may need, and we'll leave Sunday morning."
 "Leave for where?"
 "Los Angeles."
 She frowned.

Hoping it would just go away or that he would grow out of it like I did didn’t seem likely.
 His grades were terrible, and he kept getting in trouble for being in the wrong place at the wrong time or with the wrong person.
 For instance, he was put on probation for being in a car with someone who was in possession of a replica firearm.
 He looked like total shit, and when we confronted him about it he was feeling bad enough that he confessed: He was addicted to the pain pill known as Oxy.
 He told us that he needed our help to get off of it.
 We never thought to find the reasoning behind the drug abuse, we just thought he had tried it and grew to feel dependent on it.
 He was always a tough kid to raise and he was often a handful and we felt this problem could be handled like any other.
 But we were novices when it came to helping someone kick drug addiction.
 We did our best to assist him and we attempted to detox him at home.
 We called Brandon’s real doctor (not the ones who prescribe marijuana) and asked for guidance.

Seth started to stand up and signaled me to wait for him.
 He jumped over and ran out into the open.
 He leaned forward and narrowed his eyes, probably trying to see the disappearing bunch.
 He held his hand out, signaling me to wait.
 Then he beckoned me and I stood up.
 Then someone tapped me on the shoulder.
 I bit back a scream and whipped out my knife.
 But I dropped it in surprise as I spotted Emily standing over me, rocking back and forth on her heels.
 I squealed and hugged her tight.
 Jason was limping over with a grim expression on his face.

He recoiled as if struck.
 “Well done,” Qurrah said, his eyes locked on the corpse.
 Harruq recognized that look.
 His brother had seen something he wanted, and he would have it.
 “A strong life and a fresh death.”
 “The battle?” Harruq asked.
 Even as they stood there, he watched several orcs go running past, howling murder.
 “We will partake in our own way,” Qurrah said, kneeling beside the orc.
 The savage clutched his stomach, his hands the only thing holding in his innards.
 Qurrah’s thin, ashen face curled into a sneer.

“No.
 Council does not attempt to rule the North.” I considered that, considered my watcher.
 He was a volunteer.
 I seethed for a moment, but flashes of my mother and council cloaks flooded my thoughts and I had to block them.
 “So the North… has no council at all?” His answer was uncomfortable.
 “No.
 No council.” He paused while he formed the rest of his reply.
 Steed watched him, intent.
 “We are… unruled.” “Unruly,” Steed added with a laugh.
 “You’ve never had a council?” Grey shook his head.

 “Clear your mind,” Velixar said to his apprentice.
 “Let the emptiness give you comfort.”
 The wind blew, swirling cold through his ragged clothes.
 Velixar watched his apprentice take several deep breaths.
 “For this spell to work, you must have a significant idea in mind,” he said.
 “Make it bleak and vile.
 If you are to darken someone’s dreams, your own mind must be just as dark.”

“Yup,” Harruq laughed.
 “Mum was always smart for an orc.
 Even knew how to read, if you believe that.
 Bet she did that on purpose.”
 “Yes, but why?”
 Harruq shrugged.
 “Thought she was being clever?
 Who knows!
 But I can spell my name now!”

 Jim – Hey Liz.
 Liz – I brought this for you.
 Jim – Sweet my poster.
 This is going where the old Legend of Zelda poster used to be in my room.

 Jim – This painting deserves such an honor.

I ran a hand through my wet hair and walked out to the fire.
 The scene wasn’t any less impressive this time, and I sat on one of the large, flat rocks facing the lake.
 Chevelle brought me a plate of food, settling in beside me.
 There were berries and roots, and a rich, savory meat that dripped onto my hands as I tore into it.
 It was a feast compared to what I’d been eating.
 And even though he was my watcher, my captor, I had to admit I felt less alone with Chevelle there.
 Steed pulled his own ration from the spit and sat on my other side as we all watched the surface of the lake.
 And beyond it, mountains.
 The mountains at dawn were so much more intimidating and I was hesitant to leave our camp.
 Everything had begun to seem real.

What can I say?
 This was the style at the time.
 I was sitting at the bar with Bill, just a twenty-two year old kid, when a vision walked in.
 She stopped just a few steps inside the door.
 She wore purple high waist pants and a cream colored blouse that went all the way to her neckline with ruffled edges framing her stunning face.
 Her long blond hair flowed down to her shoulders.
 If I could put a caption over her head, it would have read, “If you talk to me, I will kill you.” She looked completely out of place, and her blue eyes lit up the room.
 Her silent stare suggested that she was not there to be picked up or even approached.
 She was not the typical girl entering an 80’s bar and dance club.
 My mouth must have dropped open as I watched her every move; she appeared to be looking for someone in particular.

“Take these for now until you can obtain more.”
 Qurrah accepted the bones, stashing them into a small pocket he had sewn onto his robe.
 A silence fell over the two as far away a wolf howled.
 “I wonder,” Velixar said, gazing in the direction of the howl.
 “Do you have a brother?”
 Qurrah shifted his weight a bit.
 “Why do you ask?”
 Velixar looked up to the moon and stared as he spoke.
 “I have had dreams.
 I see you beside me, a strong ally, but I see another half-orc leading my army.

We would play music and perform together in a coffee house, until he married and moved away.
 Not long after our one date, Serena died in a car crash.

 But I had seen too many funerals.

He and Sharon had had a good time at Teri’s dance, and the stereotypical costumes—drop-waist dresses, cloche hats, raccoon coats—had made him wonder what life had been like for Marie Tranton before she’d gotten married.
 Had she gone to lots of dances and parties?
 He wondered what radio programs she’d enjoyed and if maybe she’d preferred to read.
 Sighing, Rick rose to go inside.
 He didn’t feel like being alone all day.
 Maybe he’d call Dirk and go play racquetball.
 Or maybe— He stopped and turned around, hearing footsteps.
 Footsteps?
 Who would be out here?
 A neighbor's child, maybe?

“I tripped on a crack and scraped my leg.” I said flatly, the lie rolling off my tongue easily.
 I placed my last dish down and sat in my chair.
 Dad chuckled.
 “You’re so clumsy.
 I wouldn’t be surprised if you tripped on your own feet.” “Yup, that’s me, clumsy.” I pulled my leg close to my body.
 My parents had believed for a long time that I was a klutz.
 That was the only way to explain the million of cuts and bruises I gained from fighting creatures.
 The truth is that I have really great balance, which I had gained from so much fighting.
 I was a little klutzy when I was small, so it was easy for my parents to believe I still was.
 Mom placed the food on the table.

BG:  	It’s just that, you know, we’re toiling here in a medium which few accept as art, few accept as anything but stuff for teenagers to fuck by.
 Right?
 So, to try and instill in it some of the eternal verities, well, it seems pretentious.
 But it also seems meet and right that one should try.
 Lennon said something about nothing being new in rock after “Great Balls of Fire.”  In a sense, he’s right.
 I mean, I’d never question his authority.
 But, we still try, right?
 He still tries, God bless him.
 Is “Like a Rolling Stone” better than “Great Balls of Fire?”  Is “Working Class Hero?”  If so, why?
 The lyrics.

We ended up throwing away 90% of this junk, as he really didn’t want much of it anyway.
 Rummaging through his old belongings was a grim reminder of his former life.
 Brandon eagerly cleansed himself of almost everything and was resolved to start fresh.
 His stay at Narconon had also exposed him to a minimalist lifestyle completely unlike his prior existence.
 He had learned he didn’t need “things” to prove anything to anybody.
 His ex-girlfriend, Tiffanie, met us at the storage unit to claim her belongings.
 She looked about twenty pounds heavier and it was good weight.
 Tiffanie had been clean and sober since her last relapse in the rehab center.
 They smiled at each other and commented on their vast physical changes.
 They knew their life as a couple was over and that they had both gone their separate ways, while both going in the same positive direction—off drugs—despite astronomical odds.

The rest of the night passed quickly as Rodregas did his best to bandage his stomach wound.
 He did not think the knife had cut into anything too important; at least it was not bleeding too badly.
 He was surprised that he was not more tired; maybe his new body handled such things better and could make do with less sleep.
 He was usually a light sleeper and was very surprised that they had been able to get the drop on him.
 His guess was that the AElf maiden had cast some sort of spell on him to mask their approach, and he kept a close eye on her to make sure she did not repeat the effort.
 Of course she was also very nice to look at, so he did not need much of an excuse to enjoy the view.
 In the morning, he slowly pulled out some of the supplies and bundled them.
 He tried not to show how much he hurt.
 The wound might not kill him, but every movement hurt.
 He also handed Audrian a few of his coins.

I guess I should at least be glad you aren't going to lie to me.
 Unless you really didn't ever want to go, and were lying to me all along."
 Rachel shrank in on herself a little.
 It almost looked like she was going to cry, which should have made me feel bad, but I was too mad to care.
 I'd been miserable the whole way there, and especially the whole way back, and then she wanted to just pretend like none of it had happened.
 Rachel's lip trembled slightly as she finally managed to get a response out.
 "This isn't like you.
 Why are you doing this?"
 Cindi used to do the exact same thing.
 Her 'woe is me, I don't understand what is happening act' had usually worked with Dad, and it'd always infuriated me.

He wouldn’t tell Aurelia, either.
 That would be stupid, and stupid he was not…‌most of the time.
 “I need a drink,” he said, turning toward the town and trudging back.
 All he could think about was getting a good, stiff drink.
 If he was lucky, he might get in a good bar fight.
 Nothing helped him forget his worries better than walloping a fellow drunken idiot.

It felt like another attack was on the way.
 My pulse was skyrocketing and the room wavered as my vision dimmed.
 It didn't make sense to be having a panic attack right now, but images of Cindi swam into view, alternating with pictures of Alec and Rachel.
 It was like Alec's cruelty to his sister somehow meant I was failing Cindi.
 I concentrated all of my energy on thinking about Alec, about how much I hated him, about what I was going to say to him next time I saw him.
 Beyond all expectations, it worked.
 My heart rate slowed down to something approaching normal, and the room stopped moving around.
 By the time Mrs. Alexander finished taking the roll, and returned her pencil to its customary place behind her ear, I'd stabilized enough that I could read my notes again.
 The group project was due tomorrow, and since Alec hadn't bothered to make an appearance in class since my first day in Sanctuary, it was looking like I'd have to do the whole thing by myself if I wanted to pass.
 Yet another reason to hate him.

He had a ragged beard and held a small battle axe.
 Rodregas’ sword blow was too fast for the guard to block and had the strength to stun a guard wearing regulation armor.
 His sword cleaved the guard in half, and a gout of blood and gore splattered him.
 Rodregas pulled his sword free and spun away from the mess.
 As he came to rest the sound of arrows was quiet, part of his mind knew that Imeralda was backing deeper into the forest.
 As he cleared the mess he had made of the last slaver, Rodregas came face to face with an Immortal Guard.
 Behind him were two more slavers.
 The Immortal Guard wore the classic half plate of regulation Immortal Guard armor: A full suit of Mithril chain covered with a breastplate and leg guards and vambraces for the forearms.
 His head was covered with a half helm.
 His Mithril was shining in the sun.

Rodregas just headed for the wagon and got it going.
 With a last confused look from Rodregas, Audrian and the other two headed back towards the nearest town.
 The three talked little as they traveled.
 Rodregas set a hard pace and Imeralda sat in the back of the wagon.
 Doi’van weighed too much to ride in the overburdened wagon or to ride the horse, so he jogged next to the wagon.
 He had impressive endurance.
 Right before dark Rodregas was watching carefully and found the faint signs of the rocky trail that he remembered.
 He turned the cart onto it, and after going down the path a bit he came across a good place to camp for the night.
 As Doi’van and Rodregas set up camp, Imeralda went back, doing her best to erase their tracks.
 After dinner they all took turns sleeping and keeping watch.

 Jim – Dad is going to cook?
 Someone actually let him into the kitchen?
 Liz – You’re dad’s a good cook.
 Jim – Since when?

Johnny – Yeah, so?
 Eugene – They have a picture of me posted in all of the local police stations.
 I’ve got a reputation.
 They wouldn’t believe me if I went in and testified that the sky was blue.
 Johnny – Who’s damned fault is that?
 Eugene – It’s mine.
 For the most part it was worth it.
 Especially when the news story broke that officer Roberts spent an entire week diligently patrolling the area while keeping an eye out for Martians who are in the country illegally.
 But no matter, I won’t be going to them anyway.
 Johnny – Then what are you going to do?

"You miss your dad.
 I can tell it in your voice."
 His shrug would've been imperceptible except for the fact his arms were still wrapped around me.
 "I do.
 I don't really remember him, but I've read through his journals dozens of times.
 It seems crazy to miss what you never knew, but there are days when I really wish he were still around to give me advice.
 I think that's what I missed the most.
 That and his stories."
 I smiled.
 "That sounds nice.

It’s got that “Green River” riff to it, a chugging thing, even though it’s acoustic, it sounds like a freight train, don’t you think?
 CM:  	Ok, uh, “If You Push Your Belly Button your Legs Fall Off.”  Many critics said this was like a children’s song.
 Like “Mary Had a Little Lamb.” Consciously so?
 BG:  	A children’s song?
 Shit.
 No.
 It’s about being in bed with a new woman.
 It’s about that moment of intimacy after you’ve spent each other, that time when you’re running your fingers over each other’s bodies, asking about little nooks and crannies, scars and tattoos.
 I said this to a woman—the “white swan woman” in the song—after our first intercourse.
 I said to her, “If you push your belly button…” and she laughed long and hard.

"Then you'll try again Tuesday morning."
 He squeezed her hand.
 "Don't worry, Marie.
 You'll get back sooner or later.
 And until you do, I'll take care of you.
 I promise."
 She went upstairs with him and said goodnight outside her bedroom door.
 But her heart began pounding with panic as she thought about the day she'd just spent in 2011.
 She'd worn trousers in town, and she'd embraced a man in public.
 And now she was spending the night alone with him in his house!

The others watched me, silent and wary, but the tracker smirked.
 He wasn’t afraid of a sword.
 The last tracker hadn’t given at broken bones, not even before the threat of certain death.
 I’d need something dreadful, a new tactic to convince him.
 A tiny snake sunning on a nearby rock caught my eye and I smiled.
 Some part of me knew what had happened before, had felt it.
 I could do it again.
 I slipped the tip of the sword down to the tracker’s leg, just above where his knee met the ground, and sliced his trousers up to the thigh to reveal bare skin.
 Drawing the snake close with magic, I took it in my hand, its thin green body writhing over my left palm, the sword grasped in my right.
 The prisoner watched me, almost smug.

I held onto that hope right up until I saw Mrs. Sorenson joining everyone else in staring at me whenever I looked down at my book.
 There was no mistaking the look on her face; it was utter distaste, possibly with a dash of disdain.
 I was so tired of it all.
 By the time English rolled around my natural embarrassment had given way to actual anger at Britney for starting it all.
 She tried to catch me at our lockers in between classes, but I pretended not to hear her, and made it safely into Mr. Whethers' class before she could catch up.
 Part of me acknowledged how petty it was, but I avoided her attempts at a whispered conversation during class.
 Mr. Whethers unknowingly helped my cause, when he crossly silenced a couple of girls on the far side of the classroom.
 He was normally so even-tempered that even his moderate rebuke instantly shut them up.
 I probably shouldn't have felt quite so happy about it, but I was pretty sure from the way they'd been looking at me that I'd been the source of their gossip.
 When the bell finally released us, I couldn't avoid Britney any longer.

Are you deaf?” she retorted.
 “Uh, no, I’m not.
 I don’t know what a light pixie is or why you saved my life, but thank you” I said, trying not to snap back.
 “Well you are a half-ling and we need as many of them as we can get,” She pointed out.
 “Plus I’m not evil, so why shouldn’t I help you out?” “Uh thanks I guess.” This situation was extremely awkward to me.
 She winked and disappeared in a flash.
 I limped over to my body ignoring Seth’s yells to tell me to sit down.
 I felt the wind pick up and was whisked back to my normal self.
 I felt fine except for the fact it hurt to stretch my left side.
 I would probably be extremely stiff and sore tomorrow morning, but I was used to that feeling.

At his feet lay the wrapped corpse of Ahrqur.
 “Tun’del was a skilled swordmaster.
 You both have proven yourselves as strong as I believed.
 Unwrap the body.
 It is time we begin.”
 Much preparation later, Qurrah and Velixar stood on opposite sides of a naked Ahrqur.
 The elf lay on his back.
 Thin scars and symbols decorated his body, including a slanted Y across his forehead.
 Thirteen stones surrounded the corpse, each dabbed with a bit of Qurrah’s blood.
 Velixar held a piece of Ahrqur’s flesh in his right hand.

Relax and take a nap."
 Not likely, she thought, her body still tingling.
 Rick propped himself up on an elbow, gazing at her.
 Her eyes were closed, her face still flushed.
 He knew that she wanted him, and he didn't think she'd respond to his touches and kisses the way she always did if she didn't love him.
 He could make her happy if she stayed here with him.
 They'd get married and make love day and night.
 And soon they'd have children.
 She'd have a family here, and that would make up for the family she had in 1927.
 They swam and played in the surf, but Marie thought Rick seemed very sober.

Removing administrative red tape and inefficiencies in the banking system can multiply the use value and productivity of real money, because the same money can be utilized for more transactions.
 The same is true for information, technology, training, transport and other factors.
 Increasing the speed of dissemination of information and new technology can accelerate the creation of new businesses and new jobs.
 In many developing countries, inefficient bureaucracies are slow to take decisions, issue licences, review applications, sanction loans, and amend legislation.
 This inefficiency directly impacts on the pace of development.
 Streamlining and expediting decision making and the movement of other social resources is a highly effective strategy for spurring development.
 Comparative scales need to be created to measure the movement of each of these social forces within and between nations.
 Strategies can be evolved to stimulate more rapid overall development by directly acting to increase the velocity of these forces up to ten-fold or even more.
 Progressive Attitudes
 The world we live in today is an external expression of our inner attitudes.

 Do you want some of my lotion?"
 "I brought some."
 He went to take a bottle from a drawer.
 "I'm not as red as I was last Saturday."
 "Do you-do you want me to-to rub some on you?"
 He glanced up, on the verge of asking her why, since it was only his arms, not his back, that needed the lotion.
 Instead, he silently handed her the bottle.
 Marie squeezed some lotion into her hand.
 Starting at his wrist, she rubbed his arm, working her way up.

They couldn’t even know that was what had happened until the others.
 Until the pattern became patent and they found the source.” I stared at Ruby, imagining the nameless “others” who’d been taken by her venom before they discovered its root.
 But it was not the idea of those strangers that tightened my chest.
 Poison.
 To her mother.
 Chapter Twelve Unexpected Company
 My dreams were wicked that night, all venom and wolves, snakes and beasts, death and fire.
 I woke in my bed, light filtering in through the window.
 The door was open a crack and I could see Chevelle sitting in the front room.
 I was hesitant to face him.

With the snapping of the fingers the wind stopped.
 Rodregas then dropped the hand, grabbed Van’dret’s head and twisted.
 He remembered that day in Raven Tower when he had snapped Korin’s neck and his arms bunched up, his muscles rippling with the strain.
 Van’dret was an Immortalist.
 His neck did not snap easily, but it snapped.
 Rodregas did not stop snapping it until he had the man’s face looking into the rock below.
 The three sat there for a minute and then stepped away to rest against the far wall to get some distance from Van’dret’s body.
 After a few minutes Doi’van said, “Well, one more Immortalist down, that’s good.” The other two nodded.
 Rodregas said, “We did not learn much more though.
 We still don’t really understand why they are interested in Infernal power now and willing to break The One Law.” “You mean if that is what they are doing.

Several marked police cars hide in an adjacent apartment complex that has a driveway into the grocery store parking lot at the opposite end of the shopping center.
 I am instructed to park my truck’s front end against a fence that borders the parking lot facing the greenbelt.
 I am shown new surveillance photos of the two suspects and their vehicle: a red Dodge Charger with tinted windows.
 The code word which I am to use in a sentence to confirm the exchange of money for drugs has been changed to “Reno” and I see a pattern so I assume that if the deal does not go down this time, my next code word may be “Vegas.” I pray there isn’t a next time.
 Chapter 20: Going Down Finally a red Dodge Charger is driving slowly over the entrance bridge.
 I say, “Red Dodge Charger approaching at one o’clock,” attempting not to move my lips, as the vehicle is coming almost directly towards me on my right.
 The Dodge slows almost to a stop just a couple of car lengths away.
 I am unable to see in the tinted windows of the car but I am certain they can see me; I stare back as if to say, “Is that you?” They are obviously aware that I am there, alone and awaiting their arrival.
 The car slowly pulls away after taking a good look at me.
 I lose sight of them, as they seem to be going towards the opposite end of the parking lot.

“Let's move boys, we have a lot more walking to do.” Jason groaned.
 “Why can't they have cars in Igneeria?
 Or maybe a motorcycle, I'm even fine with a golf cart.” “Because,” I said and walked past him, not looking back, “Igneerians aren't lazy Jason's.” I heard him huff and Emily ran up beside me.
 “Good thinking,” she said.
 “The girls should take control.” I shrugged.
 “I guess if that's what you want to do.” Thankfully, there were no trees anywhere except one.
 The ground was mostly dirt and rock, easier to walk on.
 The mountains loomed ahead of us and something tingled down my spine.
 Something was going to happen in those mountains, I just knew.
 The sky was clearer here and also more windy.

We checked me out.
 We went down to the nurse’s station and said, room 1324 checking out.
 (laughs)  It’s funny now.
 But, then, it was like we were doing something extraordinary and perhaps not entirely wholesome.
 We drove home in compete silence.
 And when we got home, we undressed as if it were all scripted, as if this was the end of that chapter.
 And when we were both naked, we fell together into the bed.
 And we fucked and cried and cried and fucked and it was all ok.
 If only for a little while.
 It was shortly after this that I left Memphis for good.

I wasn't sure what to do."
 "I'm okay, I just need a minute."
 Since I was already on the ground, I really did just want to lie there for a moment, scorpions, dirt and all, but Britney didn't seem to understand that concept.
 Now that my eyes were open and the whole 911 question had been answered, she was determined to get me back on my feet.
 Chapter 8 I was midway through brushing my teeth before I realized I'd had another night filled with nothing but regular dreams.
 I'd walked into two different classes and found out that there were tests I'd forgotten about, been stranded at the side of the road, and been chased through some kind of rain forest, but while some of those dreams had been plenty terrifying, none of them had even a touch of the surreal vividness of the ones I'd had my first few nights in Sanctuary.
 Maybe they were just some kind of psychological defense mechanism popping up in response to all the changes.
 If so, I kind of wished I could be sick still.
 It's a heck of a thing to not want to be healthy, but I'd gone to bed most every night hoping I'd get to experience another one.
 It was depressing to think that I probably had one less thing to look forward to.

What does this mean?
 Nothing.
 But it made for interesting song material.
 I like some of the lyrics, which are a little plain, despite the ornate title of the song.
 CM:  	And, that’s just you and your guitar.
 BG:  	Right.
 Actually, recorded here at home, right over there, in the corner by the bookcases.
 I set up a mike in the corner, turned my back to the room, and used the wall of books as organic echo, a trick, I’m sure you know, that Robert Johnson employed to get his idiosyncratic vocal style.
 CM: 	No, I didn’t know that.

The bigger boys laughed.
 A street of gravel with ditches for drainage: Eighth Street.
 And a cocker spaniel bitch named Cyrano.
 Born with eyes the color of the sea, green and mud, a dull roiling behind a semitranslucent screen.
 Born in a matter of minutes, so fast the nurses were dubious, the doctor almost late.
 The town was Lewiston, New York, a carbuncle on the gritty side of gritty Niagara Falls, New York, the former honeymoon capital of the United States, a country which, like Niagara Falls in microcosm, had lately fallen into disrepair.
 Now, Niagara Falls, Ontario, just over the national border, where my mother's incredibly large family hailed from, was bright and brisk and clean and gardeny, the shiny flipside of its American counterpart.
 I’ve seen the great falls frozen; I’ve seen it turned off as if there were a giant tap.
 I’ve stood on a rocking boat deck beneath its monstrous incontestableness.
 Where I was born is a grey little town, a pustule on the side of grey little Niagara New York.

He is happy and he has been drug free for over a year and he lives in a healthy environment.
 Ironically, Brandon was working the detox center on the day of his one-year anniversary of sobriety.
 Brandon told us that it suddenly struck him as he sat on the bathroom floor comforting a young man as he convulsed and withered in pain.
 Brandon was the young man on the floor twelve months ago and he had no idea who comforted him that day but he remembered his compassion well.
 He had evolved in a short year from the position of a detoxing addict receiving compassion to the position of a former addict providing compassion.
 Brandon is giving back!
 Brandon considers the staff and students his second family.
 We don’t see Brandon often because he works in the “boonies” many hours away but we talk to him almost every night.
 He usually calls us late after his shift ends around 11 pm.
 My wife and I put him on the speaker phone when he calls so we can both share his day with him.

“Where do you go, Sir Paladin?” He showed no sense of humor at Rodregas’ little joke about being a Paladin; Rodregas hoped Doi’van had not taken him literally.
 “As far as I can, is my main plan at the moment.
 Clearly the Guild of the Celestial Path is going to be looking for me.
 Let’s just say I don’t wish to be found anywhere right now.” “And if they find you… and they will in time, will you then become a Vengeance Daemon?” asked the Hellborn.
 Rodregas simply flourished his short swords and smiled and stated, “Let’s just say that it should be interesting.” The Hellborn nodded very thoughtfully at Rodregas reply.
 The half AElf had followed the conversation between them with obvious interest, and quickly followed Doi’van’s’ lead in swearing the oath to the All-Father.
 But with the two of them the oath seemed different, more easily said and with no need for threats.
 Rodregas was not sure why, but he decided it was something to think about when he had more time.
 The rest of the night passed quickly as Rodregas did his best to bandage his stomach wound.
 He did not think the knife had cut into anything too important; at least it was not bleeding too badly.

What took me by surprise was the betrayal I felt.
 All the years I’d lived in the village, I’d never counted on anyone the way I had done with this group, Chevelle especially.
 The feeling in my chest was so thick and heavy it burned.
 Struggling with my reactions kept me distracted from the ride.
 It was steep now, rocky, a haze hanging in the few spiky trees.
 When we stopped for the evening, the men quietly set up a perimeter.
 Except for Chevelle.
 He was watching me as I glared back at him.
 Why had I expected more from him?
 He was my watcher.

She placed a gentle hand on my shoulder and led me in.
 “What shall we do today?” I went back over our conversation, trying to find some meaning.
 Inspiration, or maybe distraction, hit me as I recalled the dark-headed stranger.
 “Lineages.” Junnie raised an eyebrow as I sped to the study, but I’d worry about Evelyn later.
 This was my chance to find out about this Chevelle Vattier.
 After a dozen or so volumes, my determination began to falter.
 There were so many lineages, but I needed something on the northern clans, something on Vattier, and Junnie didn’t have that.
 I’d need a library, maybe even the Council library.
 I shivered; I definitely wasn’t sure about that.
 Even if I worked up the nerve to sneak in, I didn’t have the magic to search documents to quickly find what I was after like the Council members did.

Children, however, never learn from their parent’s I-told-you-sos.
 He was like a sick animal and we just tried to keep fluids in him and listen to the doctors who guided our effort.
 After the initial detox period, we used professional grade drug tests and surprised him with them.
 He always had an excuse for why he couldn’t pee.
 I would hand him a bottle of water and tell him I would wait.
 He was never truly clean.
 When he slept, I went into the bedroom to see if his chest was inflating with air to assure me he was still alive.
 It reminded me of when our boys were babies and sometimes we would check on them in the night or as they napped and we never left the room until we verified they were breathing just because that is what a parent does.
 Chapter 15: Happy Frickin’ Holidays!
 As Thanksgiving approached, our traditions looked impossible to pull off.

 He chuckled, dropping another kiss on her neck.
 "I think you'd better go back to your room."
 He was afraid she'd run if he moved too fast.
 "Oh.

It was coming, this revolution of meaning, this concentration on the word.
 And, all along, behind it like a dark river, ran the beat, the melody, a sort of communication device that was both insidious and right out there in the open.
 See, rock wasn’t subversive to the people who wanted to know.
 It didn’t trick anybody.
 It’s the most godawful honest music on the planet.
 In the end, I think that’s what has kept it so powerful, its honesty, its lack of guile.
 CM:  	Tell me more about what changed your direction.
 Who are you listening to now, maybe, that you didn’t listen to before.

Your hair is cut.
 You come back every morning bruised.
 What is it that you hide from me?”
 Harruq lowered his eyes in shame.
 “It’s not…‌I didn’t mean anything…”
 “What is it, Harruq?
 Tell me the truth.”
 “I…‌I’ve been training with someone.”
 Qurrah crossed his arms.
 “Who is he?”

Marie had been looking forward to going to the Cape, but listening to her mother talk about it, she wasn't so sure she was up to going.
 She needed the familiarity of home.
 She went up to her room soon after Tom left.
 She hadn't bought a stuffed animal for Rick's t-shirt, so she spread the shirt over a pillow.
 After she'd changed into a nightgown, she clutched his handkerchief in her fist and sat down in the rocking chair by her bed.
 She wished she'd gone to the library today--she'd like to have something to occupy her mind.
 She-- There was a tap at her door.
 "Marie?"
 "Come in."
 Her mother opened the door.

“You lied to Emily?
 She’s going kill you.” He smiled faintly.
 “She doesn’t need to know.” “So a dwarf told you something?
 Why didn’t you tell us?” I asked.
 Seth looked away.
 “It didn’t actually include you or anyone else, so I didn't say anything.” He paused.
 “They said that I would betray you all and be Kojas' servant.
 I would be the key to the downfall of Igneeria.
 I don't know what to do Jazell; I don't even know if those things are true.
 They won't attack me and I swear, if you gave them a minute, I bet they would help me.” He was talking so fast the words almost blurred together.

Fortunately, the man was only a few yards away, talking to a cameraman.
 He looked up as Rick and Marie approached.
 "Mr. Waite, Steve Reynolds spoke to you about a--" "You're Rick Newman, right?

 He turned to Marie.
 "And this must be our little star."
 He winked at Rick and smiled at Marie.

Daddy tried to get access to the bodies, to provide a second opinion even though that isn't his real area of expertise, but they blocked him cold.
 He thinks they were worried about scaring away the tourists.
 They had to make the accident go away, to save the local economy."
 My hands had gone cold despite the oppressive heat, just now hitting its full stride for the day.
 You didn't hang around the fringe without running into plenty of people who were conspiracy theorists.
 Discussing UFOs, Illuminati, and X-Files had been like air and water for some of the people I'd known back in Minneapolis.
 I'd never given their wild theories a second thought before, but what Britney was describing sounded like a pretty convincing attempt at a cover-up.
 I looked up as I realized Britney had fallen silent, only to realize with a start that a pair of tears were trickling down her face.
 "Mark and Lessi were the only ones to really open up when I moved in.
 Their great-grandparents were some of the first people to settle down here.

And what made it worse was Jason found one of Jazell’s arrows sticking out of the ground.
 But there was no Jazell.
 An arrow without its shooter was never a good sign.
 Emily twirled the arrow in her fingers while Jason paced back and forth.
 Emily had offered to be the one who paced but Jason had waved away her offer and started pacing.
 So all Emily could do was sit there and twirl the arrow in fear because right now it wasn’t looking good for Jazell and Seth.
 “What I don’t get,” Jason said, “is how the arrow managed to stay in perfect shape when the ground collapsed.
 The arrow should be broken and not sticking out of the ground a few feet away.” “Maybe she shot it after,” Emily suggested, because that meant that she was alive.
 Jason rubbed his eyes.
 “I guess that’s a possibility.

But I begged her to keep our secret, for her protection…
 And then several pages were torn from the diary before it continued.
 It was an accident.
 A product of her temper, her human emotions.
 They were testing her, a servant told me.
 Anvil was holding her back, Rune with magic.
 She snapped and they saw her power.
 Some denied the possibility but not my father.
 He has attained his prize, that which he has always coveted.
 I will stop him.

Qurrah had a solution but it was far from pleasant.
 Most likely he would die, but he had to try.
 He heard no screams coming from around the corner, but he knew that meant nothing.
 He had to believe his brother was still alive.
 He had to help him.
 Qurrah took out his last healing potion, popped the cork, and then held it before him.
 Blood was beginning to fill his throat once more.
 His stolen energy was quickly fading.
 He had no time to waste.
 He tilted his head as high as the arrow in his neck allowed, positioned the mouth of the vial against his lower lip, and then closed his hand around the arrow shaft.

"It's not like that, Adri.
 It's..." I didn't even have to cut her off.
 She couldn't finish her own thought, couldn't come up with a lie that was believable.
 I shook my head and went back to my desk before my invulnerability wore off and she brought on another attack.
 I missed them both so badly.
 Dad had always been there to listen when I got into problems like this.
 He'd known how to deal with the world, how to work with circumstances so that what resulted was beneficial, or at least something I could live with.
 And Cindi.
 If she were still here this would all be a moot point.
 I hadn't ever needed any other friends while she was alive, hadn't ever had to really put myself out there where I could get dragged into the kind of stupid infighting I'd read about for so many years growing up.

Faster than I would've believed possible, we were all in our dresses, and waiting in the living room for the boys to make their appearance.
 Jasmin and Rachel had worked what I was pretty sure was actual magic.
 Even Jessica was nothing less than stunning, and I didn't look as bad as normal.
 Jasmin's backless black dress and shoulder-length gloves had streaks of blue that brought out her eyes, while Dominic's tight, red gown seemed to give her the confidence and poise you'd expect from someone so gorgeous and utterly exotic.
 Jess had opted for a sleeveless silver number that flared out at the bottom so much I wasn't sure how Isaac would be able to walk next to her without stepping on the shimmery material.
 Rachel's mauve dress was probably the most conservative of all, neither over-snug, nor especially low-cut.
 It had seemed entirely out of character considering what she'd purchased for the rest of us, but when I'd asked, she'd just grimaced and said Alec would've made her stay home if she'd chosen anything more daring.
 None of which helped me feel any more comfortable in the tight, strapless wonder Rachel had been so excited to give me.
 Even with all of the weight I'd lost since the accident, it still felt like the material was fighting a losing battle to stretch itself over my frame.
 I'd been hoping to be able to put off actually putting the dress on for at least another half hour, but when my makeup had finally been pronounced satisfactory, Jasmin had studied me for a few minutes, pulled my hair back, secured it with a pair of silver combs I was worried might actually contain genuine diamonds, and then helped Rachel cram me into the dress.

“A healing sigil is why wizards live so long.
 It is considered by most to be the moral choice instead of the Immortalists’ answer for long life.” “What about you Doi’van?” Rodregas asked.
 “Imeralda says that you are almost as powerful as me as a magician.
 If we found a way, would you like to take on some of the power of the sigils?” he asked.
 Rodregas had expected an immediate response, but instead his question was followed by a long pause before Doi’van answered.
 Rodregas had learned that Doi’van thought before speaking.
 “I am not sure.
 I like learning magic, though I am just beginning.
 I would think that I would take on a minor sigil or two.
 I am a great warrior, but I like to learn new things and I would like to have sufficient magic to be able to learn spells.” Rodregas nodded.

“My name is Dieredon,” the elf gasped.
 “Know it before I send you to the abyss.”
 He fired two arrows, one for each eye.
 They shattered into fire, and finally blood did flow.
 It ran down the dead flesh and bone that was his face, over his black robes, and pooled in the grass below.
 He fell prone, still screaming his anger and fury.
 For five hundred years he had walked the land of Dezrel.
 All that time, all those killings, and this was how he would fail.
 “Karak!” he shouted, all his power fleeing him.
 His undead minions collapsed, their souls released.

“Achoo!” “Choo!” “Hachoo!” My ears popped as I burst out with laughter.
 Evelyn began to run toward town and I couldn’t stifle it, despite the fact that it was absurd something as insignificant as a sneeze would give me such pleasure.
 I wondered briefly how I’d delight in a choking fit and then tugged the lobe of my ear as it popped again.
 Apparently I wasn’t used to laughing.
 I strode off toward home, taking the long route despite my good humor.
 As I approached the old tree, its twisted and gnarled limbs reaching into a cloudless gray sky, I caught sight of an aged elf leaving.
 My stomach dropped; it was a Council member.
 Tassels hung around his neck depicting lines and accomplishments: sky blue for receiving the calling, deep crimson for service to the guard.
 His chest bore a personalized crest, an oak leaf on an unbroken shield of gold and acorn brown.
 I watched from the trees as a rainbow of a half dozen tassels fluttered behind him where he rushed down the path toward the village.

Those nations that regard themselves as the standard bearers of democracy and human rights within nations cannot justify denying these principles between nations.
 World peace and prosperity in the coming decades will depend on our willingness boldly to confront this issue.
 At the end of the Second World War the victorious nations joined together to found the UN.
 At the end of the Cold War, the organization needs to be re-founded, and restructured according to democratic principles, to give a more active role and more equitable representation to people of all nations.
 To deem such considerations unrealistic given the present alignment of power in the world is a short-sighted view.
 It ignores the incredible speed and scope of changes that have radically transformed international relations over the past half decade.
 It assumes that the present system has the backing of the international community and that it can and will sustain itself regardless of whatever steps we may contemplate.
 A fundamental change in structure is essential and inevitable.
 The break-up of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War have resulted in the demise of the bipolar system which dominated international relations after 1945.
 The United States is now recognized as the sole superpower and the primary determinant of actions by the UN Security Council.

I could offer pages of justifications, but I won't bother, as I recognize how flimsy they are.
 Still, I'll offer few recollections for the consideration of real evangelists.
 During my years between conversion and earnest churchgoing, I often experienced campus evangelists, church pastors, elders, and other enthusiasts whom I sensed wanted to make me into a notch on their belt, and who have left me doubtful about the worth of salesmen’s tactics in the service of God.
 During my college years, I would frequently get waylaid by too-friendly people.
 I must’ve looked pagan or drug addled.
 Usually they ran in twos.
 While one of them smiled, the other would ask, “Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?” “Yep,” I would say, and either stay and observe their perplexed surprise, or excuse myself before they could ask, “What church do you attend?” and then pitch theirs to me when I said I don’t, which was usually the case.
 The only effective evangelist I encountered in those days was Tony Tarantino, a lanky Jesus freak with frizzy red hair and an expression both bewildered and wise.
 I picked him up hitchhiking.
 He settled into the seat, set his Bible on his lap, stared at me for a minute and asked, “Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?” “Yep,” I said, and readied myself to field the standard subsequent questions.

A whole range of new security challenges is rising to confront the global society.
 The increasing number, complexity and unpredictability of security threats cannot be managed effectively and in time without international cooperation based on a fundamental change of attitude.
 We are now at an historic crossroads: one path leads us back to a static, unstable and exclusive competitive security paradigm; the other leads to a far more stable and dynamic cooperative security paradigm inclusive of all nations and responsive to future needs and challenges.
 A global cooperative security system is needed that seeks to strengthen national security without increasing the insecurity of other states.
 It should be based on the fundamental principle that force will no longer be tolerated by the international community as a legitimate instrument of national policy.
 World Army
 The limitations of the competitive security system have given rise to numerous calls for the establishment of various types of standing international military force.
 The role of UN peace-keeping forces has been expanded dramatically in recent years to maintain peace in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia.
 At the same time, the scope of its activities has been enlarged to include limited forms of peace making as well – disarming guerrillas, conducting elections and enforcing human rights.
 Article 42 of the UN Charter also empowers the Security Council to take direct military action where necessary to maintain or restore peace and guarantee international security.

He whirled around, his helplessness showing on every feature of his face.
 “Have faith in him,” she said.
 She pulled a strand of hair from her face as the wind blew against her.
 “I have given up everything for you, Harruq.
 Don’t you see that?
 My friends, my family, my home; they are all gone from me.
 Because of you.
 Don’t make it all for nothing.”
 Harruq’s anger and frustration simmered and swirled in a dying fire.
 He could not argue with her, not about that.

 Art – Well, I met a pretty girl, we talked, and she didn’t run off screaming into the night.
 I found myself attracted to her, and enjoyed her company from the beginning.
 And since she didn’t run off screaming, and she did accept my invitation out for coffee, I got to know her better.
 I wonder if she’ll marry me.
 Jim – Damn.
 We’ll find out after you see how she reacts to you telling her about mom.

So I resort to an English dictionary, look up "adore" and all I find are synonyms: worship; revere, venerate; and one somewhat helpful description: deep, rapturous love.
 That one rings truest.
 According to my vocabulary, if we adore something, we are drawn to it and resist separation.
 Its presence comforts, inspires, provides us with hope and meaning.
 The thought of losing it may terrify or leave us in despair.
 I feel all that about my kids.
 I have felt somewhat the same about a few others, at least for a time.
 But I would be lying if I claimed to feel all that about God.
 My problem invites the question: how can I adore God when I don’t quite know what to make of him?
 I hear and read that he’s a person, and a spirit, who resides everywhere, outside and in us.

I didn’t move as I listened to discern if they were real.
 They seemed to be close, but muffled—maybe in the next room or down a corridor—as they echoed off the stones.
 I thought I’d picked out Anvil’s deep voice.
 “Trapped here like rats… cowards…” He was outraged.
 Someone else, Grey maybe, worry coloring his tone.
 “We can’t just leave them out there.” I knew Chevelle’s voice, interlaced between the other comments.
 “She’s not ready… we can’t… too soon.” And a voice I couldn’t place.
 “… another setback…” They seemed to be in disagreement but I couldn’t find the interest to stay with them.
 I faded back into sleep.
 These dreams took me farther.

And to be able to have access to it, well there wasn’t any practical way to really keep it out of the hands of anyone who actually bothered to look.
 Liz – There’s that much?
 Jim – Dad could almost start his own shop with what he’s got so far.
 Liz – I never thought of your dad as a dirty old man before.
 Jim – Kinda funny isn’t it?
 Liz – It’s gross!
 Jim – I don’t think he’s gotten laid since well before Johnny was born.
 Liz – How can you actually talk that way about your dad?
 He’s your dad!
 Jim – We all have urges you know.

That isn’t what I wanted.
 I just want people to be afraid whenever they hear my name mentioned, why weren’t they quaking in their boots?
 Jim – Hate to break it to you, but Eugene doesn’t inspire fear into anyone.
 Well maybe girls who might one day marry a guy with the name Eugene.
 In fact I bet mom’s all over the country use that as a threat ‘eat yer peas or else maybe you’ll end up marrying a guy named Eugene.’  I bet it works too.
 I’d be afraid.
 Eugene - Shut up dude.
 Jim – So, what’d you do to get your butt almost handed to you this time?
 Eugene – Nothing.
 Jim – Even wannabes don’t usually beat people up for no reason.

Rodregas locked the door to prevent a surprise.
 He should have done that before; it was sloppy of him not to take such a simple precaution.
 Asking Captain Poir to send up Adapt Korin had been totally unplanned.
 He had been dreaming of killing Korin for all the 18 years that he had served in the tower.
 The Sorcerer Ravenhurr had been an immoral monster that used those around him for his own selfish desires.
 But Adapt Korin was of a more casual evil; he never passed up the opportunity to hurt those around him, physically or emotionally.
 Ravenhurr had existed in the same body for the full eighteen years of Rodregas’ service, and was hundreds of years old.
 In all his years serving in the tower Ravenhurr had only tried to hold the ceremony three times, each time abandoning the attempt due to the lack of a celestial animal.
 A celestial animal was extremely rare, but required as part of the ceremony for Ravenhurr’s next step up in power.
 In contrast, his assistant, the Adapt Korin, had been going though bodies constantly.

He actually applied himself to it, and was pretty good at debating the bible and other religious topics in just a couple of months.
 Gene turned Conservative Christian, it was kind of scary for several months.
 After about three or four months of taking bible lessons they decided to baptize him.
 Art – Three months without offending the entire group and getting him-self kicked out?
 I am indeed impressed by Gene’s willpower, I didn’t know he even possessed that much.
 He didn’t last much longer did he?
 Jim – (shaking his head) No.
 At his baptism.
 Well I thought he was going through with it, he had me convinced.
 I thought he was for real and for true going to join that church.

Whatever was there had run away because of the attack, and recently.
 I questioned my sister again—she’d had some time to cool down—but she was no help.
 I immediately knew she had not even considered that whatever she had been so interested in was still out here, probably close.
 I didn’t clue her in.
 After a little more time there, I acted as if I’d lost interest and headed home.
 Tomorrow, I will follow the tracks.
 I will find whoever was there and solve the mystery of their rudimentary tools and strange huts.
 I yawned.
 After a quick glance around, I slid the book back into my pack.
 I rolled over and fell asleep listening to Ruby’s quiet tune.

"If we get a chance, we'll come back."
 She turned around, gazing up at him anxiously.
 "I didn't mean to sound ungrateful.
 I've had a wonderful time, and--" "Shhh--it's OK."  He reached out to caress her hair.
 "I'm glad you've had such a good time here that you don't want to leave."
 "It's been magic, Rick.
 Thank you for bringing me.
 And for getting me into a movie.
 And for doing everything in your power to make this trip special for me."
 "You're very welcome."

It was like walking into a palace, complete with painted, spun-sugar clouds, and burgundy drapes made out of rich velvet.
 If it wasn't for the press of people pushing me from behind, I probably would've stayed in the front entryway right up until the sound of the orchestra filtered down to me.
 As it was, I only got a few hurried looks before being rushed along with the rest of the students.
 Seeing all of my classmates looking utterly bored as they allowed themselves to be herded through the most amazing building I'd ever seen brought me back to my original train of thought.
 I hadn't actually spent every waking moment thinking about Les Misérables.
 A fair number of those seconds had been spent with Brandon.
 He'd already been picking me up from school every morning and dropping me off most days.
 We now spent every lunch together, and he'd started lingering when he dropped me off.
 It was still only on the days when Mom wasn't home, and I hadn't quite mustered the guts to invite him in, but it'd still been really nice.
 Of course it'd been the logical kind of thing to have start happening after someone asked you to the Ashure Day Dance.

I kept running until I became winded and then hastily searched for some kind of shelter.
 Burrowing deep in a briar patch, struggling to catch my breath, I wrenched the wad of papers from under my shirt, buried them in the soil beside me, and then waited for my punishment to come.
 But no one was coming.
 I was naïve to think they would chase me like hounds on a fox.
 They had magic—they were High Council.
 I stayed in the patch of briars for most of the day, cowering despite myself, but as the sun lowered in the sky, I crawled out on my belly to start the long walk toward home.
 It was late by the time I reached the tree and I was tired enough I didn’t care as much about being caught.
 I didn’t even know if they knew who broke the seal, if they knew I was the guilty party.
 But I was still quiet as I entered the house, then my room, and slid into bed.
 The next morning I slipped out early to call on Junnie.

When both had as many as they could carry, they went to check them out.
 "We have 17 books and 21 articles," Rick told her when they were back at his house with their materials spread out on the floor in front of them.
 "I don't even know where to start."
 "Can we wait a while?"
 He looked at her in surprise.
 "You want to wait?
 Why?"

The entire kingdom knew of his notorious action, stealing a light elf for his bride, though the stories vary.
 Some insist he was overtaken by love and she came willingly.
 Others that he raided her village and took her in the night.
 A servant once told me he heard of her extraordinary powers and beauty and sought her out, bargaining with her parents.
 I scoffed at that.
 What kind of person would trade their child?
 But now that I am older, I see.
 I see what power and greed can become.
 My doubts about the more outlandish stories, those about the obsession with power and ideas of breeding a stronger line, are gone.
 But maybe they were in love.

And I don’t think they’d understand our reason.
 I followed Emily down the stairs, in our pajamas, to the door.
 We were careful not to make a sound but I listened closely to the sound of her dad snoring.
 When the snore rang clearly through the house, I breathed a sigh of relief.
 We threw on our sneakers and snuck out the door.
 The summer night air was cool but a little sticky and clammy, making our bodies feel damp.
 I followed Emily down to the back of the garage, where we sat down and entered the monsters’ world.
 I pushed my green hair back and hid behind a tree beside Emily to watch the dwarfs.
 There must have been more than ten of them gathered together.
 They were parading around a blazing camp fire, mumbling and talking about things I couldn’t hear over the flames.

"What is it?"
 She dropped her own gaze.
 "The reason I like dancing so much is that I like you to hold me."
 He smiled at the pretty rosiness in her cheeks.
 Taking her hand, he leaned close to whisper, "One day--one day soon--I plan to arrange things so that I can hold you all night long."
 Her blush deepened.
 She understood his allusion, and although she wasn't ignorant of what the marriage bed involved, she had no firsthand experience at all.
 And Davis wasn't some adolescent boy trying to touch what he shouldn't; he was her Prince Charming, and he'd all but proposed marriage to her.
 Daringly she entwined her fingers with his and raised her eyes to smile into his.
 The evening was magic.

To her it sounded like the can-opener on warp speed.
 Buddy drew from everywhere, listening with equal fervor to Woody Guthrie, Odetta, Hoagy Carmichael, Django Reinhardt, Coleman Hawkins, Bill Haley, Lonnie Donegan, Howlin Wolf, Eric Dolphy, Skip James, Shostakovich.
 Music fed Buddy the way most of us grew up on oatmeal and peanut butter.
 And he absorbed it all, filtering it through his sensitive system to come out his delicate fingertips as liquid electricity, a sound even today many guitarists cannot duplicate and few can even explain.
 By thirteen he had his own band, made up of less-skilled classmates at Snowden Elementary.
 They called themselves Regulation Footwear and soon were playing gigs at high school dances and other social occasions, at Clearpool, even at an end-of-school year rally at the Overton Park Shell, foreshadowing later triumphs.
 Clearly, it was Buddy people came to see, Buddy who garnered them engagements with older audiences.
 Regulation’s drummer, poor Gyp Leach, could barely keep time on his Sears drumset, taking lessons after school at Guitar & Drum City, just progressing past a four-four beat.
 But word was spreading about this precocious guitarist who sounded like a coup de foudre, this scrawny, pimply 8th grader with licks like a junkyard dog.
 Buddy Gardner.

It was the one sure way she’d know it was me.
 A wisp of bright blonde hair swirled around Junnie’s shining eyes as the door swung open, and I decided I must have caught her working; she looked flustered.
 Junnie was older than I, but remained striking with the blonde hair, blue eyes, and thin features that seemed to be standard-issue among the village elves.
 The Council had assigned her as my tutor, citing my advanced age as the reason I couldn’t learn with the others, but I suspected it was my stunning lack of ability that had landed me here.
 Junnie brushed a lock of hair aside.
 “There you are, my Fredora!” She was always trying out new nicknames for me.
 It was no secret I despised my given name: Elfreda Georgiana Suzetta Glaforia.
 I decided, not for the first time, my father must have been a drunken imp.
 Not that I could remember him, but I could definitely blame him because the father was always responsible for naming the firstborn.
 It wasn’t as if you could get more unoriginal than using the ancient word meaning “elf”, but he certainly hadn’t needed to follow it with a string of ridiculous, flowery—I stopped mid-thought, realizing my tutor was watching me.

“Why now, why do you have to ask?”
 “Answer me, brother.
 Now.”
 “No.
 I don’t love her.
 Is that what you want to hear?”
 The other half-orc tightened the grip on his whip.
 “Forget what I want.
 If you do not love her, then kill her.
 Now get your head beyond her and focus on the task at hand.

"This week we've exercised, done laundry, shopped, gone to the beach, cooked, watched TV, and talked the whole time.
 Well, except when we were watching TV, and even then your questions helped me to get to know you."
 She laid her head on his shoulder, pleased but confused.
 Rick was so different from Davis.
 She wished that she could talk about him with her mother.
 But when she could again talk with her mother, there'd be no point.
 Rick would be gone.
 That thought brought tears to her eyes, and she snuggled closer to him, wishing she could have everyone she cared about in the same decade.
 They spent the afternoon watching TV, reading, and napping.
 "I feel so lazy," Marie said, stretching as she yawned.

So I’m careful about what I buy, and I pick the things I do buy for durability and longevity.
 I need a car, so I buy a Toyota.
 If I needed a car that would break down, I could buy a Jaguar.
 “And it isn’t only the desire for stuff that devours our time.
 It’s also that we try to buy security.
 People think they need to not only have lots of stuff, but to save or invest or buy some insurance so they’ll be sure they’ll always have lots of stuff.
 We need a bit more faith.
 I mean, I don’t have AAA or any kind of roadside service insurance because every time a car of mine has broken down, it’s been a block or so from my mechanic’s house.
 Except one time.
 “The one time my car broke down in an inconvenient place, a guy stopped to help me, and he happened to be the handsomest man I ever saw.

His long dark hair was pulled back.
 He wore not the clothing of the knights but the robes of an Immortalist Sorcerer.
 Across his chest was a sash.
 Rodregas guessed him to be the Guild’s Ambassador to the Knights.
 Rodregas’ blood froze at the sight, though he did his best to remain casual.
 He knew that the Guild had a representative at the Cathedral but had not expected him to be so closely watching the registration table.
 Rodregas fell into old habits of survival.
 He kept his eyes to himself and let himself feel the tiredness of travel on the road.
 When it became his turn, Rodregas stood there silently.
 The knight, an older man with a short gray beard, who was missing his left hand, waved him forward.

Britney was so excited she could hardly speak, but I was too excited myself to feel very superior.
 I floated through my next class, and would've gone through the rest of the day the same way, if I hadn't had to share a class with Alec.
 Still, I was so happy that even Alec's giving me the cold shoulder didn't completely sour my day.
 Rachel had turned my illness into something really cool, and Brandon really did like me.
 Life couldn't get much better than this.
 Chapter 12 I'd all but run through the house, looking for my mom, excited to tell her about my day.
 Instead I'd been greeted by nothing but half-filled boxes and silence.
 I didn't really want to unpack, but it was long past needing to be done and I knew if I left it to Mom that we'd never really get moved in.
 If I'd had anything even remotely better to do with my Friday night, I would have done it.
 I didn't, so I started with the stuff that we'd piled in the living room because it was marginally cooler downstairs.

The bigger half-orc stepped back, willing to watch his brother work.
 While Harruq was skilled in swords and had all the muscle, Qurrah possessed far more interesting talents.
 Qurrah mumbled words, sick and spidery.
 The bones in the slab of meat snapped erect as if pulled by invisible strings.
 He kept whispering, his eyes wide.
 The meat floated from his hands and then lowered into the fire.
 Qurrah twirled his finger, and the slab turned as if on a spit.
 “We’re eating fancy tonight,” Harruq said, tossing the pot back to its corner.
 His stomach growled as the aroma of cooked meat filled his nostrils.
 “Glad you approve,” Qurrah said.

She was a heavy woman and her girth made her seem even shorter than she was.
 She had an infectious laugh.
 Grandma worked at a department store named Zodies.
 On occasion, my mother would take us to the store to visit her on her break.
 We would run from aisle to aisle searching for her brightly colored smock.
 One of the few times I ever remember eating out was when we shared her lunch break and ate hot dogs and popcorn at the department store cafeteria.
 I still think of Grandma whenever I walk into a discount store and smell the snack bar.
 We lived with our grandparents longer than we should have, but my mother had little choice.
 My mother, still young and very attractive, was saddled with the responsibility of two young boys who knew nothing about her predicament.
 She made sure we never felt like we were a burden, but as I look back I know it must have been so difficult for her.

The main rule of flattery with women is to never lie.
 It was a lesson taught to Rodregas by a lost love, and one that had served him well over the years.
 Most women can always tell a lie, especially in such a moment of connection as the talk after good sex.
 Luckily, even with far more normal women there is always something good you can say; with Imeralda he could have gone on for hours.
 Imeralda’s eyes lit up in pleasure and humor at his words but, of course, he was careful to say nothing of the future, nothing of love.
 Such talk would serve no purpose and would likely ruin the moment.
 To his surprise she also kept such thoughts to herself.
 The rest of the night, the two lovers spent quietly connected and at peace, but they shared few words.
 In the morning after meditation, Doi’van pulled forth two wooden staves that he had cut and said with a smile and an exaggerated wink, “Apparently you are healed up from your wound now, so I think it is time to stop with these making of shadows like children and time for some more physical training.” As he finished speaking he tossed Rodregas one of the staves.
 “With my people we teach our children to fight using the staff.

They didn't arrange anything you could use to verify they're for real?"
 I suddenly realized why parents got such a big kick out of catching their kids doing something wrong.
 Mom looked so sheepish I almost laughed.
 "Well, he did say he'd arrange for an immediate advance to be wired over to our bank, but it's closed on Saturdays, and it isn't like I can go calling up the bank president for something trivial like that."
 I opened my mouth, still unsure what to say in response to her latest excuse, only to be interrupted by her cell phone again.
 "Yes, this is she.
 Mr. Kard?
 Oh, hello.
 A wire?
 Really?

My raised eyebrow was completely involuntary, and apparently more eloquent than I'd realized.
 At least it earned me another laugh.
 "It wasn't like it was easy or anything, but Donovan gave me some good advice when things were the worst.
 I don't remember his exact words, but essentially it came down to the fact that there'll always be people who're better than me at something.
 Even gaining super powers wouldn't change that.
 What's important is that I do the best I can with what I've been given.
 As crazy as it sounds, Alec's pack needs me."
 I mentally reached around for something similar and then finally nodded.
 "I guess I can understand that.
 My mom would have a hard time functioning without me, so I try to do the best I can at taking care of her."

She missed talking to her mother.
 She knew her mother would understand about Davis.
 All she wanted was for Marie to be happy.
 She'd always been nice to Davis, but she'd never treated him like a son.
 But she'd love Rick.
 Rick was so warm and funny, and her mother would feel comfortable with him.
 She stopped, squeezing her eyes shut.
 She couldn't stop thinking about him.
 Even when she thought about her family, Rick somehow surfaced in her mind.
 Rick glanced at his watch.

Screams, distant enough that they had to be coming from the other wing of the house, reached out and pierced my heart.
 There wasn't any way to be sure whether or not it was Rachel or her mother, but ultimately it didn't really matter.
 Brandon was going to kill all of us.
 Another door caved in under a blow from Brandon's fist, and I suddenly realized that he was now standing in the Lilac Room.
 "Spread out and find her."
 The words were nearly unintelligible, coming as they did from a throat that shared little in common with Homo sapiens, but the venom behind them was unmistakable.
 I fled the bed where I'd been studying, and hid in Alec's studio, but I could hear them getting closer, the dissident melody of growls, howls, and destruction growing stronger as they rampaged through the house.
 Terror stretched time out, but even so it felt as though only seconds had passed before I felt Brandon enter Alec's suite.
 I crouched frozen on the floor as my death crept ever closer.
 As Brandon crashed through the studio's far wall in an explosion of plaster and lumber, I tried to shield my eyes, only to find that I couldn't move.

"Thanks."
 She used both hands, slowly rubbing the lotion over every inch of his back.
 She couldn't even imagine touching Davis like this, and she didn't think it had anything to do with morals.
 She just didn't feel comfortable enough with him to do something this personal.
 Yet here she was running her hands all over the back of a man she'd known only a week.
 Was it a difference in morals?
 Or times?
 Or was it Rick?
 She'd never known a man so warm and kind and open.
 Feeling a surge of affection, she slid her arms around his waist, laying her cheek against his back.

His eyes bored into mine.
 “Were you scared?
 What’s it feel like there?” “You know when you’re away from home and no matter how great a time you’re having, you’re still a bit uneasy, so when you get home you always feel relieved?
 You unwind, your heart slows.
 Nothing can hurt you now.
 That’s how it felt.” “You’re a lucky guy,” Eric said, in a more wistful tone than I had ever heard him use.
 Freedom
 Driving through Los Angeles, thinking is dangerous.
 An instant of distraction can get you killed.
 I turn off the I-pod and for some moments attend to driving.

The half-orc opened his mouth and then closed it.
 A boy’s face flashed before his eyes.
 _You’re an orc, aren’t you?_
 “Yes,” he said at last.
 “I’ve killed.”
 He eyed Aurelia, desperately wishing to know what she thought yet unable to figure out why he even cared.
 He thought he saw pity in her eyes, perhaps compassion.
 But there was a hardness there, a doubting that made him wonder just how much of him she truly knew.
 “Tell me of the first time,” she said.
 He shook his head.

In fact, he and his partner asked me if I had done this before because I was so stern with her and refused to bend.
 I guess they were accustomed to dealing with strung out drug addicts.
 I was still completely disappointed and I told them so.
 I just wanted this over and I had every expectation that it would be finished tonight and I could get on with my life and my son could get on with rehab and hopefully get healthy.
 Once I was un-wired I was able to call my wife who was a sobbing mess.
 Not hearing from me and the uncertainty of the night had taken its toll on her and my son.
 I headed home defeated and unsure if I would ever get the opportunity to complete the task that would free my son from a three to five year prison term.
 I was mentally exhausted and I didn’t know what my next move would be.
 All I knew is that the officers told me that if Ashley contacted me, I was to put her off until next week because they couldn’t put a crew together until the following Tuesday.
 Not only did I need to put humpty dumpty (the drug deal) back together again, I had to do it on a specific day at a specific time and in a county that the dealers clearly didn’t want anything to do with.

These tapes somehow also disappeared until 1999, when they were found in a stockroom in an abandoned studio in Los Angeles by a technician there who, with some heaven-sent Extra Sensitive Perception, sent them to Camel Jeremy Eros, c/o City Lights Bookstore, where for a while I was taking my mail, while recovering from a broken relationship, one that emasculated me, silenced me, did me up a treat.
 These tapes were a godsend—they took me out of myself, out of the self-pity I was wallowing in.
 Many thanks to John Wender, editor extraordinaire, who recognized what we had here and ran them in his celebrated periodical.
 Hence, they ran first, almost in the form represented here, in three installments in Big City Magazine.

 Buddy Gardner died young, tragically, just weeks after these interviews were concluded.
 It lends a poignancy to what follows here, but is not the only reason to read, of course.
 There is Buddy’s stature as one of the truly original artists of his time.
 There is his infamous love affair with Lorelei who many blame for his death, like poor Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath.
 And there is the music, discussed here for the first time, how it was made, why it was made, for whom it was made.

If ever.
 Karen – (laughing) That is almost the exact same thing happened to my cousin.
 Well, she didn’t tell him that he was evil, just inadequate.
 And that after living with him, she decided that men weren’t for her.
 He never lived it down.
 Nobody in the family would let him live it down.
 We teased him all the time about it.
 Art – Has he shot himself yet?
 Or someone else?
 Karen – Not yet.

“Return before the battle starts.”
 “I will,” Harruq said.
 Then he was gone, rushing down the streets of Woodhaven toward the calm forest that nestled about it.

 [section break](break.png)
 “Aurry, are you there?” he shouted.
 He had hoped the elf would be waiting for him, but as he neared their usual clearing there was no sign of her.
 His heart skipped, and he feared she had already gone off to prepare for battle.
 “Aurelia, come on out now,” he shouted again.
 His eyes searched the forest.

Cassie tossed her hair and smiled, a plastic expression that bordered on a smirk.
 "Shut your lying mouth.
 I'm really going to enjoy this."
 Britney had positioned herself so she could see Brandon.
 As a consequence, I could see Alec's entire group, and I was amazed by their reaction to Cassie's belligerence.
 Jasmin's pretty lips drew back in something that looked almost like a snarl, and she'd tensed up so tightly she was almost shaking.
 For a heartbeat I thought Jasmin would launch herself at the other girl, but Alec reached over without looking, and grabbed her arm.
 A stocky, Middle Eastern-looking boy to Alec's right looked like he wanted to act as well, but he was looking at Alec, and an almost imperceptible headshake stopped him.
 I'd been so busy watching the byplay behind Rachel that I'd missed the last two exchanges between her and Cassie.
 Whatever had been said must have been bad though.

A flick of my fingers and light flooded the tiny space.
 I took a quick inventory: the seal on my wardrobe was intact, my drawings were still scattered across the floor, and the stash of cheese remained on the table beside my bed.
 My mother’s pendant hung from a woven leather chain above my pillow, shooting refracted beams across the bed, and I smiled as I sat beneath it.
 Scanning the pages I’d brought home from the library, I tried to find some order.
 I hadn’t even considered there might be missing pages, but I sorted what I had as best I could onto the worn comforter.
 I sat rigid while reading through, unable to fathom why it had me so anxious.
 The first pages contained a detailed description of the writer, including his lineages and how he’d come upon the information.
 He was apparently a record-keeper for Grand Council and was responsible for copying scrolls and adding new information for each of the northern clans from their various local libraries.
 Some of the information was sketchy: gossip from the neighboring fairy guild about strange activities and reports from travelers about deserted villages.
 Or maybe not deserted.

They had to hustle through the town of Oravue to reach it in time to register for the upcoming melee.
 Oravue was a good sized city, with paved roads winding up and down the sides of the hill that the town was built on.
 The whole town was dominated by the fortress like Cathedral in the middle of town.
 While the Cathedral was one of the most impressive fortresses in the known world, the town, in contrast was without walls or visible defenses of any kind, unless you counted all the winding stairs and streets that quickly got the three companions lost several times on their way to the Cathedral of the Heavens.
 The Cathedral of the Heavens was located like most powerful places of mystic significance, on a crossroad of two ley lines.
 The huge structure had been built into and around the top of a granite hilltop.
 The walls were hundreds of feet high in most places and constructed of the very sides of the mountain simply carved flat and smooth.
 Because it was built directly on and out of the very bedrock of the Earth, knocking down the fortress walls was not an option for an opposing army.
 Like the stone of the farmhouse, the stone construction of the Cathedral had been enchanted by Nymphs of the Earth.
 It was said that the ley lines were tapped to provide magical protections as great as the physical.

Brandon asked Steve to just put the pills on his windowsill so he could get high unbeknownst to his parents.
 The intention was to make Steve believe that Brandon was still using, and thus trustworthy.
 Brandon was a nervous wreck.
 He was completely confused after days of detox and scared to death that he was going to prison if the scheme failed.
 Brandon contacted the other drug dealer from his own cell phone so Steve would recognize the number.
 Brandon told Steve the concocted story and then supplied Steve with the phone number that Officer White had given him for the phony buyer.
 Immediately there was trouble: The officer had accidentally given Brandon the same phone number that Steve already possessed; the same number that had been given to Steve by the same officers for his use when he was setting up a bust of his own.
 Brandon was outed big time.
 Our son was immediately labeled a snitch on the street and had no chance of helping the police.
 Our phone began ringing with crank calls and threats on his life and ours.

 I looked at the caller ID and it was Steve’s number, not Ashley’s.
 This was even better since the goal was to get him and she was ancillary.
 I picked up the phone, which was still connected to the recording device, and she introduced herself and said she was calling from her boyfriend’s phone because hers was broken.
 The call went better than expected as you could hear Steve coaching her in the background.

Sure, celebrities and other billionaires father kids when they’re ancient, but they can afford nannies who take screaming babies for walks in the park, and they can ship the kids off to boarding schools when as teenagers they metamorphose into demons.
 My big kids are great, and I mean great in the most literal sense.
 Darcy, the artist who could draw better at three years old than I could when she was three and I was thirty three, majored in painting and photography in college and graduated then worked as a newspaper designer but soon turned to teaching.
 She teaches fifth grade kids so underprivileged that not one in her last year’s class of twenty-seven had ever participated in an organized sport.
 She loves the kids, so she’s always developing some new method, like creating a bi-weekly newspaper and having them write columns on their favorite subjects or assigning them to design their dream house and using the assignment to teach basic geometry.
 In summer, at the Boy’s and Girl’s Club, she teaches art to teenagers, most of them troubled or in trouble.
 Darcy’s great because her giant’s heart is open and she uses her brains and imagination in generous ways.
 And Cody’s one of those most-rare people who have all the tools.
 He’s strong, smart, industrious, and even handsomer than his dad.
 He’ll graduate with a B.A.

“They are arrows, Frey.” She was really on a roll today, a delightful mood.
 I shook my head, certain that didn’t bode well for me, and she laughed.
 “We are leaving them for Rhys and Rider to find.” “Are they poisoned?” “Yes.” I considered that.
 “Did they use all the ones you prepared last night?” “You’re silly, Freya.
 It’s fun.” The way she pronounced my name, like it was dear to her, made it harder to be angry with her.
 But I made the effort.
 “It’s not entirely my fault,” I huffed.
 And then I was sorry I’d said anything.
 I didn’t need to defend myself to her.
 “I know,” she said, “but it’s still fun.” I wondered if she did know.

Her face was determined, but I saw her eyes flicker.
 Jason flicked out his knives and held them so tightly that his knuckles were white.
 If he gripped any harder, I was afraid he would snap his fingers off.
 And, me?
 I pulled an arrow out faster than you could say oh-my-god-there’s-a-hideous-monster-coming-to-whip-our-butts.
 And then I launched it.
 The arrow shot at Kojas, speeding through the air.
 But what did Kojas do?
 He whipped out his sword and slashed the arrow in half right before it hit him.
 The pieces fell on the ground.

He'd forestalled my next excuse as if reading my mind.
 "There isn't anything wrong with letting someone help you.
 Sometimes a helping hand is exactly what's called for."
 The memory had a vividness that'd been lacking lately.
 It was the same aching realism that'd devoured nearly a month of my existence before I finally decided I had to try and go on with my life, for Mom's sake if for no other reason.
 I panicked when I realized just how badly I wanted to slip back into that twilight world where nothing hurt, where it didn't matter if people liked me or not.
 The one where I still had all three of the most important people in my world.
 The fear that I'd give in, that I'd end up in a hospital during the day or two it took Mom to realize I hadn't made it home from school, pulled me back sooner than normal.
 For a second my mind inhabited a body that wouldn't obey any of the normal commands.
 Fear snaked out from my center when my eyes wouldn't open, but before my heart could really start accelerating, my eyelids started functioning again.

The first one had locks, as did the second, but the third was unbarred.

 Far from town, a blue portal tore open above empty grass.
 The big half-orc tumbled out, followed by a flustered Aurelia.
 Upon her exit, the portal closed, swirling away as if it had never existed.
 Harruq groaned, spitting out dirt that had made its way into his mouth.

The collision happened before Rodregas was fully expecting it and he felt himself hit the ground and hit it hard.
 “Great,” Rodregas muttered to himself, “He has a Dire Steed and full plate armor.” Rodregas rolled over and pushed himself up, Doom Hoof stood nosing the sand looking for food.
 “The damned beast should be pulling plows not in a tournament for knighthood.” Rodregas thought.
 Rodregas’ opponent was starting to turn around, probably to ask for his surrender.
 Rodregas painfully climbed back up on Doom Hoof and circled the horse back to Doi’van for a new lance and shield.
 Doi’van handed over the equipment and said, “How did you break a shield on a single joust?” Rodregas grunted a non-committal response, and tried to find a comfortable position to hold his lance.
 “This is our last shield so when it is gone, we are done,” Doi’van said.
 Rodregas nodded in response, he had to get right back to the tilt, as it was still his turn to fight.
 Rodregas’ opponent was waiting for his return and was off full speed as soon as the flag fell.
 Doom Hoof was barely into a trot before the new opponent came into range.

For some reason, it was much more eerie than the little wiry man who blinked in and out of vision.
 One of the men spoke, his tone formal.
 “We will not demonstrate their full power at this time, in fear of shorting our forces a man for mere display.” I assumed he was probably joking.
 “As you can see, they can be frightening, however, without attack.” At that, the dogs walked into the circle.
 I had not seen them either, before they were approaching their masters.
 They came forward to snarl, one regarding Ruby and one Steed, and I could only be glad it wasn’t me as their muzzles pulled back and exposed a vicious set of teeth, complete with meat-tearing fangs.
 The hair rose on their backs and I was suddenly positive they were larger than Ruby.
 A horrific growl ripped from their chests in unison and I cringed.
 Then, at once, they settled back into relaxed seated positions as if they had never been angry.
 “We also do not do tricks.” Yes, there was humor there.

“Jazell, you’ll aim for the belly while we hold it off.
 If you can’t get an arrow in before I can cut off the stinger, then I’ll have to do it myself.” “Fine boss dude,” I said with a snort.
 Seth ducked and charged the creature, his sword held out behind him.
 Jason flicked some knives into his wrist and flung them at the creature.
 Some hit their mark, which was signaled by the creature roaring out in pain, others fell into the dirt.
 Emily danced close to it, spinning fire from her fingertips.
 The creature raised a leg and swatted at her but she just twirled away.
 The stinger narrowly missed Seth, and I saw him stumble back in surprise.
 He swung his sword at the stinger.
 It sliced through and the creature screeched so loud I was afraid everyone would hear it.

This was almost how she'd felt when she'd wandered into 2011.
 But then she'd been in a strange place; now she was home.
 She should be ecstatic.
 She'd tried for over five weeks to get home.
 Tuesday she'd spent a delightful day with her family, the best of her adult life.
 Her father had amazed her by showing her his love in a variety of ways.
 He and her brother had reconciled.
 She'd had several of the heart-to-heart talks with her mother that she'd longed for.
 She should be happier than she had ever been in her life.
 But she wasn't.

Ever heard of Montezuma's Revenge?"
 "What?"
 "Montezuma's Revenge.
 The water makes you sick, and you spend a lot of time in the bathroom."
 He smiled down at her.
 "We'll get something to eat in San Diego.
 I'm sure they have some authentic Mexican restaurants."
 They had two days left, and Marie chose to spend Thursday wandering around downtown Los Angeles, buying trinkets in the shops and the Farmer's Market on Fairfax and watching glamorous people walk by as she and Rick ate lunch at an outdoor café on Rodeo Drive.
 But her choice for their last day in California was quite a change from that: she wanted to go to Disneyland.
 Mickey Mouse hadn't been around in 1927, and she found the whole idea of a fantasy land for children exciting.

When he crashed into the line of guards, the blood ran quick and free.
 Of the seven, only two stood their ground against the glowing blades.
 One swung his sword in a high, round arc while the other stabbed forward, hoping to gut the half-orc because of his charge.
 Harruq’s charge, though, was far from mindless.
 His speed far beyond the guard’s, he knocked the stab away, then shifted his weight so that both Salvation and Condemnation blocked the other attack.
 The weaker blade shattered against the magic of the twin swords.
 One weaponless and the other horribly positioned, the two were defenseless.
 Salvation took a throat.
 Condemnation pierced rib and lung.
 Harruq ripped his blade out of the guard’s chest and shoved the body to the side.

“What do you mean?”
 “Do you not know the story of Karak and Ashhur?” The half-orc shook his head.
 “I will tell you it, if you care to hear.
 Mankind, as well as orcs, wolf-men, hyena-men, and all the other odd races scattered about Dezrel, are less than five hundred years old.
 Many elves remember the arrival of the brother gods and the creation of man.”
 “Huh,” Harruq said.
 “You may have to tell me the story sometime.
 Are you one of the elves that were there way back then?”
 She gave him a wink.
 “No, but my father was.

BG: 	Well, you know, Lennon’s “Norwegian Wood?” Yeah, man, that’s about some affair he had, right?
 But, he couldn’t talk about it because of Cynthia.
 So, he writes this piece of surrealistic poetry and he sings it, man, in this voice as old as the shepherds.
 Well, “Hell in Denmark” started that way.
 It’s code, man.
 But, you know, I don’t hide anything from my Love.
 I don’t know, I started out writing this song because I had fucked this chick, see, when I was on tour, when Lor was back here.
 And she sort of followed me around for a couple of gigs, and it was like a lost week, there, I was all screwed up.
 I wasn’t thinking about Lorelei or what this would mean to her, if anything.
 I just wanted to keep balling this chick, right?

A question.
 How, given the world’s need for such people and his belief that his young wife’s gifts will make her a mother able to lavish her child with love and wisdom, could a man who, when a novice parent, helped create and develop two such excellent beings as Darcy and Cody decline to make and help raise one more.
 After the exams, written and oral, Pam got euphoric and believed she couldn’t fail at anything.
 If she wanted to be a mom, she could do it.
 And, she said on account of my kids, it appeared I had good genes.
 So we decided to get to work.
 Mighty pleasant work, which we’re both apparently competent at.
 According to the pre-natal calculations, our little girl--Zoë Ada Fox Kuhlken--got conceived during the week after Pam’s last exam.
 All my adult life, I have worked to support other people.
 I don’t mind day jobs or sharing what I earn.

The mirror on my side of the car was perfectly positioned for me to be able to see three or four flashes of tawny brown sliding through the trees before the winding road carried us out of sight.
 Alec nodded as I looked back and met his eyes.
 "They were pretty close.
 There weren't that many of them, but they could've decided to push the issue regardless."
 I spent the rest of the trip, expecting someone to jump out of the trees, but faster than I'd have believed possible, the wrought iron gates I'd noticed on our trip out last night were swinging open, and we were turning off onto Alec's asphalt lane.
 A distinguished-looking gentleman in his fifties was waiting for us as we screeched to a stop.
 His slightly disapproving frown hinted at decades of practice letting his 'bosses' know when they'd just crossed some kind of line, all the while never crossing any himself.
 The shape shifters all exited the car, most before it had even stopped moving, and then Jessica and Dominic both appeared as I made my comparatively slow way out of the vehicle.
 "...everyone's okay.
 I was somewhat worried about taking so much of our strength away.

"Kim Logan?"
 His ex-fiancée.
 "She isn't my Kim--not any more."
 It had been over a year since they'd broken up.
 "Yeah.
 So I thought maybe she could be my Kim.
 I ran into her at lunch downtown, and I invited her out for drinks that evening.
 She's good, Rick.
 It was the first time I'd been alone with her--you know, without you and my own date--and it took her less than ten minutes to figure out that I'm not exactly the marrying type.
 I still don't know how I gave myself away.

“Well done,” Qurrah said, his eyes locked on the corpse.
 Harruq recognized that look.
 His brother had seen something he wanted, and he would have it.
 “A strong life and a fresh death.”
 “The battle?” Harruq asked.
 Even as they stood there, he watched several orcs go running past, howling murder.
 “We will partake in our own way,” Qurrah said, kneeling beside the orc.
 The savage clutched his stomach, his hands the only thing holding in his innards.
 Qurrah’s thin, ashen face curled into a sneer.
 Harruq turned away.

“I must go, friend.
 Good luck.” It took off into the sky and Emily couldn't see it anymore.
 She sighed and leaned back.
 This was getting too complicated.
 Who had the augothas meant?
 *** The sky had turned gray and the sun, which was still hiding behind the clouds, seemed to drop.
 I was still walking and walking and walking and walking and walking... You get my point.
 I was so sick of walking I couldn't explain it in words.
 Maybe in a song, here I go: Lalalala!
 So sick of walking!

 Harruq arrived at the clearing the next morning at the same time as always.
 Aurelia stepped out from behind a tree, her cold, emotionless face so different from the previous day.
 “We have sparred our two weeks, Harruq,” she said.
 “You have no need to come here.”
 “Yeah, well, you heard what I said yesterday,” Harruq said, his face red.
 “What was that?”
 He kicked a rock.
 “It’s better to spar with another, remember?”
 Aurelia frowned.

 You're very special to me.
 And I can't help being nice to you.
 When you're happy, I'm happy, and when you hurt, I hurt."
 "Oh, Rick."
 Her tears began coming faster.
 He tried to draw her closer, but she stiffened and then stood up.
 “Where-where are those books about time travel?” she asked, wiping her eyes.
 “In my office.” “I want to look at them again to see if I can find something that we missed.” “OK—I’ll help you.” “No.”  She shook her head, glancing at him but unable to meet his gaze.
 “I-I need to do it alone, OK?” “OK.” He watched her go, his heart heavy.

Seconds passed, slow and crawling.
 “If one may speak for the elves of the city, please let him come forth,” the guard captain shouted.
 “I seek the answer of the elven kind.
 I do not want blood spilled this day.”
 A single elf approached.
 He was dressed in a long green cloak, silvery armor, and he bore his bow openly.
 Antonil could barely make out his features, since he was so far down the street.
 The elf halted, drew an arrow, and fired it into the air.
 It smacked the dirt an inch from Antonil’s foot.
 Sergan shook his head and stared in wonder at his commander.

"I was very proud of you tonight."
 "Really?"
 She clutched at his shoulders, her breath coming faster.
 "Yeah."
 He wove his fingers into her hair and began pressing kisses along her neck.
 "You were the perfect hostess.
 And you looked so incredibly beautiful."
 "I-I'm sure that thought didn't-didn't cross Teri's mind."
 She arched her neck, her heart racing wildly.
 "It crossed mine more than once."

 Johnny – He has a point.
 Jim – Touché
 Eugene – Wait, you already knew that Elizabeth is in love on you?
 Jim – Yeah.
 Eugene – And you haven’t done anything about it?
 Johnny – What do you expect?
 Jim is a very special child.
 Eugene – Even so, having a girl like Elizabeth Straun feeling that way about you, and not doing anything about it.
 You must have eaten lead paint as a child.

From feeling that those who cannot find jobs must be paid social welfare to the attitude that everyone must be offered opportunities for gainful employment.
 Cultural Values and Development
 The growing violence, more and more visible disparities between rich and poor, and large-scale destruction of the environment cited in this report have raised widespread concern that the present course of development is undermining the cultural as well as the natural environment for human development.
 A careful analysis of the relationship between culture and development reveals that cultural values are the essential foundation for all lasting social achievement.
 The security, stability, productivity, growth and sustainability of society are determined by its values.
 This report calls upon nations and the international community to make a conscious shift to values that can generate greater domestic and international security, higher rates of sustainable growth, and more equitable distribution of benefits for all.
 The insistence on immediate abolition of war, eradication of poverty, democratic human rights and full employment expresses a commitment to the pre-eminent values of human life, social and economic as well as political freedom, and the development of the full potential of the individual.
 The achievement of these high human values also requires the achievement of a large number of physical, organizational, social and psychological values: higher productivity, better quality, more efficient utilization of resources, faster speed, more systematic functioning, improved coordination and cooperation, punctuality, cleanliness, open-mindedness, tolerance, harmony and a host of other values essential for high achievement in any field.
 Therefore, we have stressed repeatedly the importance of the value of integration in the formulation of strategies, of maximum utilization of human and social as well as material and technological resources, of greater speed and organization, and other values.
 Values are a powerful instrument to spur development.

“With but a thought it will strike as you wish,” his master told him.
 “Let it learn your heart, and you will find it more than sufficient.” Velixar held out his arms and smiled at the two half-orc brothers.
 They both knelt before him, basking in his unhidden power.
 “It is time you used these gifts.
 Not far is a small village.
 Go to it.
 Slaughter everyone without exception.”
 Harruq’s muscles screamed for use.
 He could barely register the request asked of him.
 All he could think of was wielding his swords in battle.

They just keep burrowing downward, and the faster you dig the deeper they go (is that a Beatle’s line?
 something like that) (laughs).
 Anyway, those little fuckers defy your best efforts, they’re almost always gonna be quicker than you.
 That’s what writing is, man, it just keeps going farther into the sand, the thing you’re looking for, the thing that’ll make it all alright.
 It just stays beyond you, just out of your grasp.
 And that’s how it should be, man, because otherwise why would you keep digging?
 Why keep looking if it’s easy to find?
 What were we talking about?
 CM:  	Uh…some people see in your “California” LPs a kind of return to innocence, a willful perspective that is more Edenic, or childlike.
 Would you say that you are seeking innocence with your recent work, that you are moving toward artlessness?

Democratization of the UN: The phenomenal advance of Europe’s multi-dimensional unification is a clear indication that in future international institutions will play a more important role than national governments.
 But this can happen only to the extent that these institutions are living proponents of democratic functioning and individual freedom.
 Ten years ago ICPF called for the democratization of the United Nations by abolition of the veto power in the Security Council, induction of new members to make that body more representative, and establishment of democratically-elected representative government as an essential condition for membership or active participation in the UN system.
 The nexus between democracy and prosperity is undeniable.
 The democratic revolution that has so effectively penetrated Eastern Europe in recent years and extended its roots in other regions must be taken to its logical conclusion at the level of nations and at the level of international institutions.
 World Peace Army: The most far-sighted of ICPF’s proposals sought to evolve a practical mechanism to promote the objectives of cooperative security and democratic freedom.
 It called for the establishment of a World Peace Army, to be constituted by and open to all democratic countries willing to renounce the right to aggression against other nations and willing to contribute personnel and resources to an international multilateral military force capable of defending its members from external threats.
 Such a mechanism, so long as it is inclusive, would provide a real and viable alternative to national militarization, whether or not it was constituted by or within the UN system.
 The success of NATO in maintaining peaceful relations among the democratic states of Western Europe and North America for more than half a century is a viable model which is limited primarily by the exclusivity of its membership.
 The recent measures taken by the European Union to constitute a European Army are evidence of the practicality of establishing a similar mechanism open to all nations.

 Seth frowned, “I don’t know but it seemed like forever.
 You scared us, Jazell.” “Especially Seth,” Emily piped up behind him.
 “He was the one going crazy to bandage you and was worrying more than the rest of us.” Seth’s face reached a new undiscovered level of red, “I didn’t want to lose a friend.” “Right…” Emily trailed off and smirked at him, wiggling her eyebrows.
 Seth squirmed slightly and avoided her gaze.
 I started to laugh but in morphed into a cough instead.
 I clutched my midsection to find it was covered in bandages.
 “What exactly happened?” I questioned.
 Seth glanced at Emily and back at me, “I don’t really know.
 We turned around to see you being mauled by a Thrasher.

"I love you, Father."
 "I love you too, darling.
 Where have you been?"
 Marie caught her breath.
 In her misery over leaving Rick, she hadn't gotten around to thinking up a plausible story.
 "I-I'd rather not talk about it."
 "Not talk about it?"
 Mrs. Tranton shot her husband a warning glance.
 Marie had surely been through a very traumatic experience, and they shouldn't make her talk about it until she was ready.
 "Why don't I have Louise make us some breakfast, and we can talk," Mrs. Tranton suggested.

But how could she do that and then leave him forever?
 How could she give herself to him so completely and then walk away from him?
 With effort, she made herself roll off him, but she couldn't resist cuddling up against him.
 "I wish I could say yes.
 I love you, Rick."
 He didn't respond for a few moments, needing to let his desire ebb.
 "If I hadn't asked you, if I'd just gone on kissing you and touching you, we would have made love.
 You wouldn't have stopped me."
 This time she did blush.
 "You're probably right."

But, the lyrics, you know, they’re a little complex: “I took my Melville out into the sun, what else could I do, I was in my twenties” it begins.
 Not exactly pop schmaltz,  you know, ABAB.
 It was a more complex rhythm to the whole speaking—and I did just sort of speak the lyrics—that was Jim.
 At first I wanted to sing it—you know, I’d worked out a melody, a weird melody.
 And he said, on, I don’t know, the like 16th try, Jim said, shit, let’s not sing this one.
 Gimme a Lou Reed kind of thing.
 Half talk the damn story.
 I’m gonna use that melody behind you.
 And he did, man, he played what I was singing on a plastic tonette—no shit, that’s that weird, unearthly descant in the background, Jim on this little toy.
 It’s not in the credits, so you’re getting it first, right?

She took it, glancing at his face as she raised the lid.
 The sapphire immediately caught the light, and she gasped.
 "This is beautiful!"
 He reached out to take her hand.
 "Marie, will you marry me?"
 She gazed at him for a moment before crying, "Yes!"
 and throwing her arms around his neck.
 Gently disengaging her arms, he took the ring from the box and slid it onto her finger.
 "I love you, Marie."
 "I love you too."

“Yeah, I know,” Harruq said, growing quiet.
 The subject of Qurrah’s experiments always made him uneasy.
 “This time there will be a slight difference,” Qurrah said.
 “What’s that?”
 The half-orc shook his head.
 “Not now.
 Another time I will explain.”
 The two grew quiet, and they stared at the fire as the time passed.
 At last, when Harruq was sure Qurrah would not bring up the subject, he spoke.
 “About the guards,” he said.

 That’s right, man.

 Man, I’m so in love with this kid already, though right now, he’s a brine shrimp, right?

He wouldn’t have been lonely if he’d married Kim or Gina or Sabrina, but he wouldn’t have been happy.
 Even sex was no longer enough to motivate him to get into a relationship like those.
 He wanted someone he could be completely at ease with.
 He wanted someone he could relax with when he came home from work, not someone he had to work to please.
 All his married buddies told him he was dreaming, that marriage was a strain, a series of trade-offs.
 But he couldn’t help hoping there was something better than that.
 Or at least someone he could love so much that he wouldn’t even notice the trade-offs.
 Rick had planned to go to the office for a while the next morning, but his friend Dirk called to challenge him to a couple of games of racquetball.
 "Didn't wake you up, did I?"
 Dirk asked as they warmed up.

I was still walking and walking and walking and walking and walking... You get my point.
 I was so sick of walking I couldn't explain it in words.
 Maybe in a song, here I go: Lalalala!
 So sick of walking!
 Lalalala!
 My legs are gonna come off!
 Lalalala!
 I want a golf cart!
 That's how much I was sick of walking; I was making a freaking song up in my head.
 I never do stuff like that, never.

“Captain Intreg, do you mind asking a few questions to confirm his status?” The Knight seemed uncomfortable under the hand of the sorcerer but nodded and said to Rodregas, “What is the eighth law of Chivalry?” “Thou shalt never offer combat to someone who is not equal in strength, unless in defense of the honor of the Order, for Justice for the oppressed or in defense of the weak,” he answered.
 Captain Intreg nodded and then asked, “A question of law: two messenger couriers stop at a keep with priority messages and switch out horses.
 The local lord finds that both horses are lame and are no longer any good.
 One of the messengers is from a neighboring lord and one from the Guild of the Celestial Path.
 What rights does the lord have in this situation?” Rodregas noticed the sorcerer seemed to stiffen at the question.
 Rodregas’ mind swirled.
 The first questions had been easy, but it had been a very long time since he had studied law.
 The sorcerer’s body language, though, directed his memory to the answer.
 Rodregas said, “The local lord is responsible for replacing the other lord messenger’s lame horse.
 There is nothing to be done for the Immortalist messenger’s horse.

One thing is for certain, someone will have to put a rating for the content on the posters and ads.
 I’m thinking that nobody 17 and under should be allowed within a mile of the show.
 Karen – Content rating, it’s just a form of censorship.
 Art – I disagree, as a parent I find that it is a valuable tool to keep me informed of what will be in the shows and movies my kids watch.
 Karen – How strict are you with what they watch?
 Art – Not at all, they can watch what-ever they want to.
 Karen - Then what good do the ratings do you then?
 Art – They give me the heads up so I know what I don’t want to watch.
 Sometimes the boys invite me to go see movies, and I want to know what I’m getting into before I agree.
 I mean, sometimes the names lie, but if you ever see version of Hamlet rated Adults Only, well then you know that they went off the beaten path a bit with their interpretation.

I felt my eyes go wide.
 "That's a pretty detailed analysis of a book you've never read."
 Rachel blushed a little.
 "I really haven't read it.
 Maybe because I'm worried that it won't turn out to be what I think it will be.
 What about you?"
 I shouldn't have been surprised by the question, but I was.
 Possibly because I'd spent too much time around people like Britney who were so caught up in their own lives that they didn't really care about what was happening in mine.
 "Les Misérables.
 The music from the musical is so inspiring that I know the book must be truly wonderful."

Brandon's pack relaxed slightly, and then, presumably acting on a signal from Alec that I couldn't see, Dominic and Jasmin fell back to help Jess and I.
 Even with Dominic under my right arm, I couldn't hop along without jostling my ankle, and I felt tears gathering in the corners of my eyes again.
 Alec carefully lifted me into his arms before I took more than two or three hops.
 Jasmin had her cell phone out before she'd even made it to the stairs, and the sound of a massive engine under hard acceleration heralded the arrival of our limo.
 I leaned back in my seat as everyone else settled into their spots.
 Alec pulled out his pocket square and used it to dab away my tears.
 "I'm sorry.
 I didn't mean to set you down so hard."
 Jasmin interrupted before I could say anything.
 "Any slower and you'd have been cut off from the rest of us by those mutts."

CM:  	Ok, um, “Hell in Denmark.”
 BG: 	Well, you know, Lennon’s “Norwegian Wood?” Yeah, man, that’s about some affair he had, right?
 But, he couldn’t talk about it because of Cynthia.
 So, he writes this piece of surrealistic poetry and he sings it, man, in this voice as old as the shepherds.
 Well, “Hell in Denmark” started that way.
 It’s code, man.
 But, you know, I don’t hide anything from my Love.
 I don’t know, I started out writing this song because I had fucked this chick, see, when I was on tour, when Lor was back here.
 And she sort of followed me around for a couple of gigs, and it was like a lost week, there, I was all screwed up.
 I wasn’t thinking about Lorelei or what this would mean to her, if anything.

“Ready to get back to it, then?” I grimaced, struggling to my feet.
 “Ruby, how long will the effects of the dust last?” “Depends.” It was the same answer she’d given me before.
 I couldn’t decide if I was truly that out of it or if everyone thought it was funny to make me drag answers from them.
 “On?” She laughed.
 “Don’t worry.
 The dreams will get better.” “They will get better or they will go away?” She laughed again.
 “Depends.”
 We were facing each other once more, ready to begin another round.
 “Want to try a weapon?” I was pretty sure I didn’t, give how much the weaponless training hurt.
 I procrastinated.

Marie woke up with a pounding heart.
 She wanted to go home--she had to get out to the garden right away.
 Jumping out of bed, she dressed as quickly as she could and ran downstairs and into the garden.
 It was just past dawn and not as foggy as it had been yesterday.
 She made herself stop running, certain that speed had nothing to do with going 84 years backwards.
 She began walking in the direction from which she'd come yesterday.
 Or from which she thought she'd come, anyway.
 How would she know if she'd gotten back?
 Surely she'd be able to recognize her own home.
 But what if she got back to 1927 but not to her house?

 (The game goes for about 2 minutes.

 Jim – Hey yeah, take that.

I was close enough my intent was unmistakable when he grabbed me, wrapping both arms around my biceps in a too-tight grip.
 “Freya—” A howl.
 A wolf.
 He let out a deep breath and it tickled my nose.
 Oh.
 Oh, no.
 No, no, no.
 My head cleared, but Chevelle still held me around the arms.
 My neck flushed, my eyes shooting to my lap.
 I couldn’t look at him.

He was fulfilling a duty.
 Then I realized what Ruby had said and I wondered if my brain would ever be quick enough to keep up.
 “Guests?” He hesitated before answering.
 “We will be traveling with some friends.” He was so vague.
 A formless irritation started to crawl its way to the surface, but I had to remember I had no right to ask.
 These were my captors.
 My fingernails cut into the palm of my hand where the map had been.
 We’d be traveling to the peak, they’d said.
 I couldn’t guess what waited there, but that didn’t stop the hope that it was something of my mother, my family.
 But even if it wasn’t, I’d be that much farther away from the village and council.

"I'm not hungry."
 She took a wonton and held it to his lips.
 "Sure?"
 He let her put it in his mouth, feeling her fingertips brush his lips.
 "Hmmm."
 He chewed and swallowed.
 "Maybe if you feed me."
 She put all the food in bowls and heated it in the microwave while he poured fresh tea.
 "Is this pork or chicken?"
 Marie asked as she set a bowl on the table.

"It's pretty rough, but not for the reasons you think.
 Mom isn't entirely healthy.
 Hasn't been since our father was killed.
 It isn't really her fault she behaves the way she does.
 When we humans get involved with shape shifters sometimes we pay a pretty serious price."
 It took me several seconds to understand why Rachel's words seemed so odd.
 Ever since learning Alec's secret I'd assumed everyone here was a shape shifter.
 Only I hadn't ever felt the underlying hint of power and energy from her that I'd come to associate with Alec and the others.
 "Wait, you're not a shape shifter?
 How is that possible?"

I watched Chevelle’s face as my eyes fluttered shut, exhausted.
 My dreams brought him close, a much-too-vivid kiss on the cheek that burned like fire.
 My skin was blistering, I could feel the color.
 It swirled around me and shocked me awake again.
 I lay on the floor, eyes wide, body unmoving.
 I was weak, tired, still under the influence, but I heard voices.
 I didn’t move as I listened to discern if they were real.
 They seemed to be close, but muffled—maybe in the next room or down a corridor—as they echoed off the stones.
 I thought I’d picked out Anvil’s deep voice.
 “Trapped here like rats… cowards…” He was outraged.

The abyss is dark, Qurrah, and there is fire, but there is also order.”
 “What do you wish of me?” Qurrah asked.
 Velixar’s face softened into a dark smile.
 “To fight the war.
 Celestia may have condemned it to continue forever, but she slumbers now.
 Harnessing enough power, we can defeat the goddess.
 We can bring all of Dezrel under our control and declare victory for Karak.”
 Qurrah stood, his eyes glimmering with anticipation.
 “Where will we strike first?”
 “Woodhaven is a symbol of cooperation between races.

And I was ashamed.
 Fannie had authority over me, but I wasn’t a child.
 It was only that I had nowhere else to go.
 That I couldn’t leave.
 “You’ll need to learn protection spells.” “I… I can’t…” “We won’t tell Francine or the Council,” he promised, and I didn’t miss that he’d used Fannie’s real name.
 Then, softer, “We won’t even tell Junnie.” I didn’t understand.
 The cold, wet ground seeped through the material covering my legs, and I shifted, fidgeting as I looked up at him.
 “I mean I can’t do magic, just useless stuff… lighting candles…” “Then we start with fire,” he said.
 Chevelle lowered his hand to mine and stood, pulling me up and toward the center of the clearing.
 When we’d distanced ourselves from the tree line, he stopped and turned back to me, still holding my right hand.

 Qurrah broke away from his brother when the last died before them.
 He could smell the fear of the villagers, and like a tracking dog he could use it to find where they fled.
 Flames danced across the side of one house, alerting Qurrah.
 The half-orc coiled the whip around his arm and pulled out a scrap of bone from a pouch.
 It was time to test the spells his master had taught him.
 An elderly man came around the corner, a torch his only weapon.
 He glared at Qurrah with unabashed hatred.
 “ _Weakness_ ,” the necromancer hissed in the wispy tongue of magic.

“Qurrah,” Harruq stammered but could say no more.
 “Eight,” Qurrah gasped, dropping to his knees.
 “It is…‌I am sorry, master.”
 Velixar walked about, examining each of the undead farmers.
 He remained quiet, hiding all emotion from his apprentice and even refusing to look at him.
 “This is the first time you have ever brought the dead back to life,” Velixar said.
 “Correct?”
 “Of this size, yes,” Qurrah answered.
 His entire body rose and fell according to his unsteady gasps.
 The man in black turned to him.

Where is it coming from, I wonder?
 After a while, I give up wondering and pray for an answer.
 When no answer arrives, I decide to track my thoughts backward, which leads me to the source, which was a recognition that I had lived much of my life in the aftermath of a grievous mistake.
 If I hadn't been so stubborn, if I had trusted God from the time I first believed, I might've spent all these years in a richer world, maybe not living every moment in the kingdom of heaven, but residing close enough so I could visit more regularly.
 And I might've done a lot of good for other people.
 In this sorry condition, I decide that my darkest sin, the one so loathsome I should never stop grieving over it, isn't any of the wicked stuff I have thought or done.
 My darkest sin is failing to do all the thousands of good works I could have done for people.
 All because I was willful and didn't allow myself to truly love them.
 Some folks would assure me this sadness and guilt means a spiritual battle is raging.
 As I tried to enter the kingdom of God, demons escalated their assaults on my soul.

We would do well to examine closely this instance to draw lessons that may aid in addressing those conflicts that continue to defy resolution.
 The most striking lesson of the Irish experience is that rapid development absorbs and dissipates the urge for violence.
 The dramatic economic advancement of the Republic of Ireland – whose per capita GDP rose within the past 20 years from less than 60 per cent that of UK to 95 per cent in dollar terms and 130 per cent in terms of purchasing power parity – has eliminated the disparity between Ireland and Ulster and fostered among the Irish in both countries a sense of pride, an expansion of employment opportunities, and a more focused channelling of social energies into productive activities.
 Economic growth in the region was augmented by the systematic efforts of the British government to eliminate the active discrimination against the minority Catholic population of North Ireland in housing and employment as well as the segregation of Catholic and Protestant education.
 Violence has subsided, yet a political solution still defies the policymakers, because some of the root causes of the problem buried far in the past have not yet been adequately addressed.
 A steady and concerted effort for permanent solution in Ireland will demonstrate the possibility and provide the knowledge necessary for addressing other intractable communal problems around the world.
 A comprehensive approach to a permanent solution must include social, economic, education and cultural elements.
 The principle illustrated here is that long-standing military conflicts can be resolved by political initiative and obstinate political conflicts can be resolved by economic strategies rooted in the principles of equity and ethics.
 The opening up of economic relations between the USA and China by President Nixon has made war between the two countries almost unthinkable.
 There are no serious conflicts in the world today that cannot be resolved through consultation, consensus and ‘win-win’ formulas.

When your children get old enough to move out of your home, you have very few opportunities to have special family moments and that makes them even more wonderful.
 We returned to our home after the trip and we went to bed late that night.
 I woke that morning before my wife and my sons.
 I brewed my morning coffee and I walked into Brandon’s room.
 I woke Brandon and I handed him one of the drug tests we still had from our failed attempt to rehabilitate him.
 It wasn’t because I didn’t trust him--it was because I did.
 I believed that every line on that test would indicate he was clean from drugs but I admit that a part of me cringed at the thought of the alternative.
 He rose quickly from the same bed that he was in the last time I tested him more than six months before.
 Brandon smiled at me as he walked into the bathroom with a proud and confident look, as only he knew the pending outcome.
 He finished and sat the testing unit on the counter and he hugged me as if to make up for his last failure.

 Well since you two don’t appreciate my brand of humor I think I’m going to bed.

The completion of the Uruguay round of GATT trade negotiations was delayed for years because this view fostered protectionist sentiment in the bastion of free trade Western nations.
 This issue elicits heated emotional debate that often overlooks obvious facts.
 For instance, increasing trade with East Asia and with low-wage developing countries is cited as a major cause of the fall in the wages of unskilled workers in the United States.
 As in the case of technology, there is evidence that free trade destroys jobs in some industries, especially unskilled or low-skilled jobs in high-wage economies.
 In some instances the devastating impact of increasing imports may justify a gradual approach to removing trade barriers.
 However, the overall impact of manufactured exports from developing countries has been vastly exaggerated.
 Exports by the Newly Industrializing Economies to the United States have risen from 1.1 to 2.1 per cent of US GNP over the past decade.
 America’s share of trade with low-wage countries represents only 3 per cent of GDP, compared to 2 per cent in 1960.
 For the OECD as a whole, imports from low-wage countries represent only 1.5 per cent of total expenditure on goods and services.
 On the other hand, there is irrefutable evidence that expanding international trade creates large numbers of jobs, even in high-wage economies.

She squeezed his hands.
 "I want to listen to my father's jokes, even though they're not funny.
 I want to sneak off to see my brother and to go to a speakeasy with my cousin Tom.
 Most of all, I want to talk to my mother.
 And--"  She choked back a sob.
 "And what I want most to talk to her about is you.
 I want to tell her how much I love you, how wonderful you are, how getting to know you made me realize that I could never spend my life with Davis.
 I want to tell her how thoughtful you are, how loving.
 I want to tell her how-how.

I’ve tried over the years to work it into something passable, something acoustic for a new album, but, well, I’m still trying.
 Its appearance on this Great Black Wonder especially rankles, because it’s a song I want to get right.
 CM: 	It really angers you, that this stuff is out there.
 BG:  	Sure.
 Does that make me a control freak?
 CM:  	No, no.
 BG:  	It’s just that, you know, we’re toiling here in a medium which few accept as art, few accept as anything but stuff for teenagers to fuck by.
 Right?
 So, to try and instill in it some of the eternal verities, well, it seems pretentious.
 But it also seems meet and right that one should try.

He continued to stare at the woods as if he expected a flying deer to leap out, wearing pink socks.
 “What the heck Seth, are you deaf now?” I waited for a sign that he heard me to appear on his face, but it remained blank.
 Emily huffed loudly, “Expect something from Jazell and me soon Jason.
 We’re out of here.
 See you around.” She grabbed my hand and pulled me away.
 Seth turned to see me leave and the look gave me a dark feeling inside.
 His face was masked with one emotion, one that made me vow to myself that I would find out what he was hiding, what he was keeping a secret.
 That emotion was not Seth, not the one I knew.
 It made me feel the same way and I didn’t know why.
 Fear.

The mating bond is one of the great sources of power for the AElf peoples,” he said.
 Rodregas did not understand fully what Jordaan meant but he suddenly added, “Then, if Imeralda is bonded to me, she will always try to keep her connection with me?” He asked a question, but he thought he already knew the answer.
 Jordaan nodded.
 “She will love others, but she is bonded to you for all time, until one of you dies.” Rodregas sat quietly, stunned by the news.
 No more words passed between the two until Jordaan was about to leave.
 “Do you know where the weapons are from the Immortal Guards?
 We are going to need them if we are going to do better during our next encounter.” Rodregas was getting his mind back to business; the news that he would never truly be separated from Imeralda revived his spirit.
 “Oh, we… took the weapons as salvage.
 It has helped to pay for your healing and equipping of the people you rescued.
 As their rescuers you were, of course, responsible for getting them properly outfitted and on their way back to their homes.” Rodregas sat shocked for a moment and then he just exploded.

He handed me the bottle of water.
 "Well I hope you'll like it here."
 "Wait, what's this for?"
 The grin was back, and his teeth were still perfect.
 "I just made you spill yours, it's only fair."
 Brandon nodded at Britney, who stood there with her mouth slightly open, as he walked away.
 After a second or two of both of us staring blankly after Brandon, Britney grabbed me by the hand, the one holding the new, unopened water bottle, and pulled me over to a table in the corner.
 "Oh my gosh, you just poured water all over Brandon Worthingfield the Third.
 And then he talked to you.
 This is so incredible."

The sooner we get you caught up, the better off you'll be.
 Shall we say a month from today?"
 The prospect of trying to catch up, all the while needing to master new material and deal with a full schedule of other classes, was too much.
 I felt tears rising to the surface even as my heartbeat sped up to near-panic attack levels.
 That was the last thing I needed, but I could only fight off so many worries at once, and I was quickly approaching my limits.
 "Now don't come unglued on me.
 The school has set aside some discretionary funds for a math tutoring lab after school every day.
 We're not fully staffed yet, but if you swing by we should be able to help clear up any questions you might have.
 You'll have to do the majority of the work.
 I expect you to actually read your math book, but if you give it an honest effort I'm sure you'll be just fine."

We're saving plenty of loving for you later.
 Meet us out back after this crap is over and we'll give you a real show."
 My mouth dropped open in shock.
 Nothing was going to get them to shut up now, not when they had such a perfect target.
 Sitting there staring at them was about the worst of all the choices open to me, but I was too shocked to pull my eyes away.
 I felt a surge of heat rush through me as the room wavered slightly.
 For a second I worried I was going to pass out, but movement behind the two punks distracted me from my heaving internal landscape.
 There was just enough light for me to see Alec lean forward and put a hand on each troublemaker's shoulder.
 There was an abortive movement by the two loudmouths, as they tried to spin around and confront him.
 Granted, the lighting was less than ideal, but it didn't look like Alec was holding onto them very hard.

The makeshift audience wore easy, amused smiles.
 They watched me, not the vacant space from which Grey had evidently disappeared.
 And then I noticed someone beside me who hadn’t been there before… it was him.
 “How…” But he was gone again.
 I’d been staring right at him and had no idea where he’d gone.
 I was just beginning to doubt whether I’d seen him at all when I spotted him standing across the circle, grinning fiendishly while he dangled an object from his hands.
 It was the feather Ruby had tied in my hair.
 I’d forgotten about it.
 I reached up to feel for it and it was gone.
 I started to get irritated but then the feather was in my other hand and he was back, his hands now empty.

Perry was his name.
 Always calling me names, trying to make me lose my balance while lifting and carrying things.
 Then he did something stupid, Aurelia.
 He did that in front of Qurrah.”
 Harruq thrust out his chin and squinted.
 “This was how that Perry guy looked.
 Seen dogs look more human.
 He was strong, and I think he was the strongest before I showed up.
 I told him about this contest me and Qurrah made up, some arm wrestling thing.
 Guy was drunk out of his mind, so when I told him we could win four gold coins he should have figured something was off.

I mean, I should have said thanks yesterday, but I really do appreciate you thinking of me.
 It was really nice."
 Rachel's eyes lit up brighter than I'd seen them in a while.
 "You're welcome.
 Does that mean we can go to Vegas?"
 It seemed like a crime to deny her, but I knew Mom didn't have the spare money to send me on a two-hour trip to an opera.
 I was working now, but by the time I could save up enough to pay for gas, food, and a ticket, the production would've moved on.
 "I'm sorry, I'd like to go, but I just don't think I can.
 If it was running for an extra month or two I could probably save up enough money from tutoring, but it isn't, so it just isn't going to happen."
 Rachel nodded, and for a second it was easy to forget that she probably got more spending money each month than I'd see all year.

The one we have all been party to has immensely altered the world’s political and economic landscape – sweeping away at a single stroke the very real danger of another world war and widespread nuclear destruction.
 The recommendations formulated in this report call for profound changes in the way we think, feel and act to meet the challenges and tap the opportunities of the coming decade.
 We should not underestimate the magnitude of the changes required or the collective effort needed to bring them about.
 Nor, as recent events confirm, should we under estimate the capacity of humankind to make these changes and realize the benefits.
 During the twentieth century, humankind has achieved an unprecedented mastery of its physical and social environment – soaring into space and landing on the moon, exploring the ocean floors, harnessing the power of the atom, delving into the secrets of the human brain and creating machines that imitate many of its functions, unravelling our own genetic code, generating unimagined wealth for many, proliferating national and global institutions, evolving the rudimentary foundations of world governance.
 Yet the very magnitude of these accomplishments has generated a sense of dependence and even helplessness.
 Our own creations have cast a spell over us.
 Impressed by the power of our works, we feel obliged to submit to our own incomplete and sometimes faulty constructions, rather than to complete or modify them to better meet our needs.
 Instead of marvelling at the wondrous achievements of the modern era, we should marvel at the unlimited human capacity for invention and progress.
 The beginning of the third millennium is an opportunity for us to rediscover the ancient truth that human beings, individually and collectively – not material resources, nor the technology we invent, nor the institutions we fashion – are the primary resource, driving force, centre-piece and ultimate determinant of our development.

"Probably not, but that doesn't change the fact that this is what I want to do."
 His sigh was ample evidence he didn't believe me.
 It probably didn't help that I'd moved in closer as I finished speaking, but I was already worrying about something else he'd said.
 "Alec, everyone keeps talking as though this fight is soon, but I've never heard an actual date."
 He finally wrapped his arms back around me, but it was a subconscious move, as if he was trying to protect me from what he was going to have to say next.
 "It's after the dance.
 The night of the new moon, an hour or two after the Ashure Day celebration ends."
 I was suddenly even more grateful we were going to the dance together.
 If I only had a couple of weeks to live, then I wanted to spend every possible second with him.
 Chapter 27 I groaned as Alec circled two of my biology essays and handed them back to me.

Commotion brought me back and I sat up, startled.
 My head spun.
 Ruby caught my arm to steady me.
 Her smile was strained as she handed me a drink of water.
 Chevelle was near the entrance of the stone room with Anvil and Grey.
 They appeared to be preparing to leave.
 “What’s going on?” I asked.
 “Nothing to worry about,” Ruby assured me.
 “Just a hunting trip.” I was still muddled, but I knew it wouldn’t take three of them to hunt.
 And then I remembered the bits of conversation I’d heard when I woke.

“Aurelia,” called a voice from behind.
 She turned to see a female elf, a friend of hers from many years before she moved to Woodhaven.
 “Yes, Felewen?”
 Felewen stood beside her and faced the window.
 Her hair was tied in a long, black ponytail, her slender figure covered by rare chainmail crafted of the hardest metals known to the intelligent races.
 She had come from deep within Nellassar, the thriving capital of the Dezren elves, as just one of many that had arrived to protect the town.
 “Many are dying,” Felewen said.
 “The humans have a spellcaster of their own who repelled our ambush.”
 Aurelia nodded.
 She knew something had gone wrong; otherwise, the battle would have been over in seconds.

Unfortunately, Mr. Whethers wasn't there.
 The substitute teacher sitting at his desk didn't even take roll; he just shut the door, told us to keep it down, and flipped open a magazine.
 While I was sitting at my desk wondering what to do with the next hour of my life, something I'd read in the physics book suddenly clicked.
 In a perfect world I would've been left in peace to finish reasoning out the answer.
 Instead, Britney leaned over and smiled.
 "So I was really surprised to see you with Brandon.
 I thought for sure he'd be pissed after you made Cassie back down like that."
 "Surprise, surprise, maybe he isn't as shallow and vindictive as you thought."
 The words were mean, but they felt good.
 There were a lot of other, even worse things on the tip of my tongue, things I really wanted to say.

Already, 156 countries have signed the treaty, owing either to coercion or indifference, and the number is expected to increase to 170 out of 179 states by 1995.
 The acceptance of non-proliferation by these countries further delegitimizes the continued possession of nuclear weapons by any country.
 All of the treaty non-signatories can be persuaded to sign in exchange for annihilation of these weapons by those that now possess them.
 Under these circumstances, refusal to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty could be considered sufficient grounds for expulsion from UN membership.
 Without a universal ban, the efforts of the nuclear powers to stop proliferation lack moral authority.
 Arguments are often advanced that nuclear weapons cannot be ‘dis-invented’, and that the danger of a rogue state or terrorist group acquiring and threatening use of these weapons necessitates that the present nuclear powers retain them for such a contingency.
 With the massive conventional firepower already available, nuclear weapons are not needed for defence, even against a rogue state with nuclear capability, and they do not represent a credible defence against terrorism under any circumstances.
 How could nuclear weapons conceivably be used to retaliate against terrorism?
 Alternative solutions can be found to address these threats far more effectively.
 Similar arguments were made in the past against complete eradication of chemical weapons.

I started to command the horse to kneel, but then Steed grabbed me at the waist and threw me up.
 I took one deep breath before we kicked the horses into a gallop and ran from the fort in a pack.
 Our pace finally slowed as the way became too treacherous.
 Massive rock formations loomed over us, loose stones underfoot causing the horses to stumble.
 The haze was so thick I couldn’t see anything but the riders in front of me.
 I only knew from the strain on my legs we were heading up, climbing higher into the gray sky and biting wind.
 Chevelle rode beside me through the day.
 When we stopped for the evening, he pulled me down from my horse and stayed near as we sat on large stones around a fire.
 Ruby was telling stories again and everyone gave her their full attention… everyone but us.
 “How do you feel?” he asked.

An orcish life.
 The icy fingers left his forehead.
 “It is a select few who have received such a gift,” Velixar said in the quiet night.
 “You have heard the voice of the dark god himself.
 Now tell me, what is it you saw?”
 “Please, brother,” Qurrah said.
 “I need to know.”
 Harruq stared at the dirt, each breath making his shoulders heave.
 His mind reeled, and for reasons he did not understand, he opened his mouth and said, “That which I fear and desire.
 I have had no questions answered, but I do know this: the time for questions has long ended.”

Right then, right at that very moment, I knew something was terribly wrong.
 They all stopped in front of us, all those pairs of angry eyes staring at us.
 They made me confused, from the warm feeling the Frost Beasts gave me to the cold feeling the Thrashers inflicted.
 They exchanged some sort of signal, including grunts and yips, and slowly advanced on us.
 The dogs stalked toward the four of us looking like a animals about to attack their prey.
 The cute look was gone and all that was left was hunger.
 The dog nearest to me jumped at my chest and landed on my stomach.
 I managed to push it down before it breathed on me.
 My legs froze in place.
 “Emily I need some defrost.” I called to her as the cold seeped through my pants and bit at my skin.

"Maybe they weren't going to kill you.
 I can't say for sure, but they've both killed people before.
 I couldn't take the chance that they weren't just playing around.
 I had to stop them."
 I thought for a moment that my knees were going to collapse on me.
 I carefully reached up and brushed the bandage on his shoulder.
 "They could've killed you?"
 Alec shrugged.
 "I came out okay all things considered."
 He was going to have to rethink this deflection thing, but now didn't seem like the time to get pushy.

“Do you have a family?” she asked.
 “I do,” he admitted.
 She said, “First, take care of your family.” "So there," I mumble.
 Out of all the people since Jesus, I can’t think of any whose advice I should trust more than Mother Teresa’s.
 But I know we humans can talk ourselves into or out of most anything.
 Books
 One reason I decided to arrange a book signing in Seattle was so I could visit Jaime and Mark Baird and meet their one-year-old Gavin.
 Not long ago, Mark did a tour as an Army psychologist in Iraq.
 Jaime recently earned a Master of Arts degree from Perelandra College, which Pam and I founded about eight years ago, and which I essentially run.
 The college is one of the occupations that keeps me rushing around, the condition that originally clued me I should read Brother Lawrence.

A long, dark cloak was clasped at his shoulders, the material thick and coarse, so unlike the soft robes the rest of council wore.
 I knew I was gaping at him, but there was something so strange about it.
 He caught my eye and I let my gaze fall to his sword belt, struggling to gather my composure.
 I had to remind myself that he despised me.
 By late afternoon, our path opened to look down on the village nestled in the rocks of a narrow valley ahead.
 Chevelle stopped on a ridge to allow us a better view.
 I didn’t think I would have called it a village—I couldn’t count the structures from our vantage point but it must have been ten times the size of home.
 The buildings were the dull stone of the mountain.
 None were trees.
 There was really no vegetation at all, no greens, no browns.

Jim – No more of that cliché “everybody hates me” crap.
 God damn it gets old.
 You sound like a character from a stupid teenager television drama.
 You’ve been sounding like that for years now and I’m just getting sick of hearing about it.
 Mom is gone and she probably won’t be coming back so go out and enjoy life for a change.
 Now get busy living or get busy dieing, but what ever you do stop living in the past.
 Johnny – Cliché?
 I’m not the one who just used a movie quote in a inspirational speech.
 And I have the right to be pissed off.
 Jim – Johnny, do you still have mom’s note?

A couple of guys who looked like they were old enough to be in college were rolling their eyes at him.
 They were whispering and laughing, but positioned as they were closer to Alec than to me, I couldn't make out any of what they were saying.
 While I agreed completely with their sentiment, they were so loud they were disturbing at least twenty or thirty people.
 Hopefully they'd quiet down once the actual show started up.
 Judging by the orchestra, it was almost time.
 I looked back, intending to shoot the obnoxious pair a nasty glare in the hopes it would shut them up, and instead caught Alec's eye.
 The house lights were still bright enough for me to make out every detail of his perfect face, and yet I was still baffled by his expression.
 He'd obviously been staring at me, was still staring at me actually, but it wasn't a leer.
 It was something else, it made me want to blush, or maybe smile and toss my hair.
 Whatever it was, it left my skin feeling warmer than usual, and more than a little tight.

All I know is that the only way to appease them is to offer sacrifices of flowers.
 Art – The flower trick is important, but it doesn’t always work.
 You need to remember to compose poems to their great beauty.
 That usually helps at least as much as flowers.
 Jim – What if she isn’t beautiful enough to deserve a poem.
 Art – Write a haiku then.
 Or a limerick, just make sure it isn’t dirty.
 It doesn’t matter, as long as you take time to make it sound good.
 Jim – But what if she isn’t pretty.
 What if the angry woman in question has a face like a horse?

Somehow he knew the blessing was inherently a positive thing.
 He remembered on hot sunny days as a kid the wonderful pleasure of lying under a tree when the city would be so hot in the summer, but in the shade of the tree it was just perfect.
 It was a random thought, but a good one.
 Doi’van interrupted his memory by asking a question.
 So like Doi’van, always thinking, Rodregas thought with a smile.
 “So first I make my infernal side more structured and then I become a part Nymph, a strange combination for a Hellborn.” Rodregas said, “I think we both feel the importance of the blessing and I thank you for sharing it.” She nodded and said, “I am so happy that I decided to go with you to sneak in, otherwise I would never have been able to receive the blessing of the One Tree.
 No matter how successful we are now against the Immortalists, I have been blessed as few of my people have.” Imeralda looked like she wanted to talk and Rodregas hated to break the mood, but they needed to get back to business.
 “We should return to the main chamber.
 The Grand Marshal will be coming soon for the official moment for me to take on a greater sigil, and I don’t think we want them to find these chambers.” As Rodregas walked from the chamber of the One Tree he felt more regret than when he had left the Infernal chamber; though in all likelihood the sigil from the Night Panther would prove to be of more use on his quest.
 The three walked as one to the Celestial Lion.

I carefully picked it up and rolled it back in place, certain I would never read from it again.
 Binding the pouch as I had found it, I tucked it into the pack.
 When I checked my hands to decipher the lines, I realized I was seeing a map.
 Yes, it was burned into my palms, but it was a map.
 I couldn’t fathom why anyone would have a ridiculous spell like that, and then it struck me that it had come from the vault, from my own family’s things.
 I bit down hard on my lip, fighting the impulsive urge that always got me into trouble.
 But I didn’t want to go back to the village, not ever.
 And I only had this one chance, this small moment before they came to retrieve me.
 I grabbed the dress off the tree branch—the last evidence of me being here—and threw it into the pack.
 Swinging it around onto my back, I started to run.

I did get to ogle a great many women half my age wearing not but skimpy swimwear.
 It was truly a wonderful experience for a man my age, or for a man of any age for that matter.
 Well Elizabeth, I am truly impressed with your talent once again.
 So much creativity and talent combined into a pretty girl.
 You’ll make some lucky man very happy one day.
 Liz – Thanks Mr. Trelain, Jim was just telling me what he thought.
 I would appreciate hearing your opinion on what you like and dislike.
 Art – Well, I must say I love that painting of Jesus and Elvis shaking hands, and the one next to it of them fighting the Ninjas.
 It looks so lifelike, and it is extremely unique in concept.
 For the rest, I’m not art-minded enough to tell you anything special.

The men quieted and listened to their commander.
 “I do not know what blessing we have received, but when it ends…”
 His voice drifted off.
 Movement behind his army caught his eye.
 He shoved a few men aside, tore through the center of his army, and then emerged at the back.
 Far down the street, his robe flowing in a nonexistent wind, walked a pale man dressed in black.
 His low hood covered all but the chin of his face.
 His gait was slow and steady.
 He kept one hand outstretched, and from it flowed a black river that branched out to form the shield that had kept the men alive.
 No arrows fired.

I returned to the first page to read.
 Today was the solstice celebration for the fairies.
 They are such fools.
 They got hopped up on dust and raided the castle.
 We had to kill about six of them before they sobered up enough to reason with.
 That was before Father killed two more just for fun.
 He said he had to prove a point, but I could tell he enjoyed it.
 I straightened and blinked.
 What is this?
 I shook my head and continued.

I felt a stab of guilt for the selfishness of the thought while looking over such loss, but I waved it away and tucked the pages under my mattress.
 Lying back on the bed as I looked up at my mother’s pendant, I closed my eyes, trying to remember… I could see her face.
 Her straight nose, her gentle smile.
 Her long hair waved around her shoulders, stray locks caught by the wind.
 She wore a white dress with bell sleeves and a low-cut neck.
 Her pendant hung there.
 It started to refract light, but there was only darkness around my vision of her.
 The wind picked up and her dark hair began to whip back and away from her face.
 She was smiling, glorious now, her arms outstretched.
 The pendant started to glow and the darkness cracked.

The thought of losing it may terrify or leave us in despair.
 I feel all that about my kids.
 I have felt somewhat the same about a few others, at least for a time.
 But I would be lying if I claimed to feel all that about God.
 My problem invites the question: how can I adore God when I don’t quite know what to make of him?
 I hear and read that he’s a person, and a spirit, who resides everywhere, outside and in us.
 I understand that if my imagination is too small to fathom God as a whole, which of course it is, I can grasp who God is by observing the qualities, nature, and actions of Christ.
 But though I have read, listened, prayed, and pondered about Jesus for dozens of years, in all honesty, given my definition, I can't claim to adore him either.
 Maybe if he were a woman, I could at least come closer to adoration, as I find women easier to adore.
 Not just for the pretty faces or figures, but for their gentler natures.

He nodded in approval.
 “Well done,” Qurrah said.
 “Killing kids is hardly worth a well done.”
 Qurrah frowned as he glanced from his prize to his brother, who sat against a tree, arms on his knees.
 “Take pride in all you do,” Qurrah said.
 “Only then will you improve.”
 Harruq shrugged.
 “You need me?”
 The smaller half-orc opened the bag he carried.
 Inside were ashes, roots, herbs, and a sharpened knife: all Qurrah needed to work his art.

“We can figure out what to do next when we wake up.” I nodded sleepily and laid down on the hard ground.
 I closed my eyes, feeling a strange tiredness come over me.
 I barely heard Seth mumbled, “I don't like our situation at all.” That night, I had the weirdest dream.
 I was standing on a dark cliff, the eerie moon high in the sky.
 The wind whipped at my hair, causing me to see the green strands in front of my eyes.
 The cold nipped at my cheeks and nose, which I tried to rub back to warmth.
 I stood at the edge of the cliff and gasped when I looked down.
 Underneath me, hundreds of monsters gathered around a fight.
 I couldn’t see who was fighting inside because a swamp troll blocked my view, but I knew it was brutal the way they whooped at a screech of pain.
 I wanted to close my eyes and look away, but I was so curious to see what was going on, that I couldn’t.

Perhaps she saw the elf in Harruq while Dieredon saw the orc.
 The kindest man might become a brute when surrounded by other brutes.
 When Harruq was with his brother, or the strange man in black, how then did he behave?
 Could he kill?
 Could he murder?
 She had to know.
 It took a simple invisibility spell to approach their rundown home unnoticed, her feet moving silently because of her natural elven grace.
 It was midday and the sun was high in the sky.
 Most of the murders occurred once darkness fell, and always when the child wandered into the forest to play.
 Lately no murders had been found, and Aurelia couldn’t decide if she should be worried or hopeful that they had stopped at the same time she had begun training with Harruq.

Jim – (to Eugene) Which would you choose?
 Eugene – I already chose life.
 Jim – So you did.
 Johnny – Had I the power, I think I would have chosen never to have been born.
 Eugene – This is a stupid conversation.
 Jim – Why is that?
 Eugene – We’re discussing whether or not we would have decided to have been conceived.
 Johnny – So?
 Jim – Since you don’t get to make the choice, it doesn’t matter much does it?
 Eugene – No, the only choice you have is whether or not to keep going forward with life after you’re born, and whether or not to have children, well assuming you can find someone to have kids with that is.

I'd seen plenty of amazing sunsets back home, but there was something about the rugged, almost hostile, skyline here that gave this one a spectacular level of depth.
 Maybe Mom was right about the west after all.
 Sure, it was hotter than Satan's kitchen, and a dermatologist's worst nightmare, but the skylines were amazing.
 Brandon opened his eyes as I let out a sigh of contentment.
 "Bored already?
 We're only halfway there."
 As I opened my mouth to respond, Vincent turned off the road onto a trail that hardly looked wide enough for a Geo Metro let alone his monster truck.
 I let out a yelp as we dropped down a small hill and then started climbing up the other side of the gully with a small bounce.
 Brandon chuckled at me, but shifted position enough to brace himself against the two beer kegs, and then reached out and wrapped an arm around me.
 A couple of the girls who'd been looking especially condescending over my surprise as we'd gone off-road were now obviously disappointed.

He felt his body, now without armor, for any serious wounds.
 “The good news is that while the tip of the lance did slice into your chest a bit, it is almost healed thanks to what Jordaan did,” said Doi’van standing above him.
 Rodregas realized he was lying on the ground over by where Doi’van had been keeping the lances and equipment.
 The spare lances were gone.
 He had lost.
 Doi’van was of course referring to the healing sigil.
 He wisely did not say it out loud as every squire there would have been asking about where they had gotten one.
 Rodregas started to get up, but quickly decided it was smarter to stay lying down for now.
 “Where did we finish?” he asked.
 “Actually we did pretty good.

A swirling black portal ripped into existence behind him, a bleak wind wailing from it.
 Out came his undead, marching in rows of ten.
 More than a hundred rows spilled out, surrounding their master with mindless perfection.
 “Find him,” he ordered as he covered his face with his hood.
 “He is wounded.
 Find him and kill him.”
 As one, the thousand moaned their acknowledgment.
 They scattered, spreading out like a ripple in a pond.
 In the center stood Velixar, his hands out and his eyes closed.
 “Reveal yourself to any one of them and I will know it,” he said, his sick face smiling.

“Perhaps.
 With Qurrah’s magic as strong as it is, I have an ally worthy of your name.
 All of Neldar will burn, and thereafter, you will have your freedom!”
 Velixar traveled west, following unseen after his two apprentices.
 He would witness their first true test, and he would bask in the bloodshed that was sure to come.
 !
 [section break](break.png)
 The two traveled over the gentle hills, only the rough gasps of Qurrah’s breathing breaking the silence.
 As the two neared the village, Harruq dared to speak.
 “Qurrah,” he asked, “who is this Velixar?”

She was so sweet and loving.
 When she returned, he took the aspirin and drank the juice, obeying when she insisted that he lie down on the sofa so that she could bathe his face with cool water.
 Marie patted his forehead with the washcloth, dipped it into the bowl of water, wrung it out, and then patted his forehead again.
 "Maybe a good night's sleep will help ward off a cold."
 She kissed his temple.
 He took her hand, pressing his lips into her palm.
 "Lie down here with me."
 She stretched out beside him, and finally, with Marie in his arms, he fell asleep.
 But when he awoke the next morning, she wasn't there.
 Panicking, he jumped up.

On the other hand, while the Hellborn were feared and disliked, the Immortalists should not be interested in Doi’van.
 He was also clearly a gifted warrior and between the two of them they would make a dangerous duo.
 However, the Hellborn were feared because of their daemonic natures; they had hungers and urges and famously bad tempers.
 Doi’van could be just as much of a danger as help.
 Rodregas had to admit though, that in the little time he had dealt with him, he kind of liked the big guy.
 It looked like Audrian was going to argue, but Rodregas just cut him off and stated, “Very well, you two may travel with me, but let’s get on the road.
 Audrian, make sure you and the other two do not forget your oaths.
 I will expect no one to know that we head for the Northern Coast.” Audrian looked like he was going to say something.
 Rodregas thought the loss of the Hellborn did not bother him, but the beautiful half AElfin maiden was another matter.
 However, her point about how she put them in danger clearly made him hesitate.

She believes you’ve been in the dark long enough.” “What do you mean?” I questioned.
 “Our real destiny?” “Yes,” he said, a little more relaxed, “it must take place in Igneeria, where you are truly needed.” My brow furrowed in confusion.
 “But wait, aren’t we in Igneeria right now?” The dwarf gave a quick, half-hearted laugh.
 “No miss, you are far from Igneeria.
 You’re in the Half-way, the place between Earth and Igneeria.
 The Half-way can act as a gate, or passage into Earth.
 It seals off the two worlds and if a monster were to make it as far as the Half-way, it would have a truly difficult time completing its journey because it won’t find a way in or out of this place.” “So let me get this straight,” I said slowly, “we’re not in Igneeria right now but some Half-way?” The dwarf nodded, happily.
 “So where’s Igneeria?” The dwarf rubbed his stubby chin.
 “The entrance changes but its current location is in your town.
 That’s how I got here.

 What is with you and those stupid comic books?
 You could have at least picked something good like Batman.
 Jim – Sumo has always been there for me in my times of need.

 She burned my collection when I was at school one day.
 At least all the comics she could find anyways.

“It will help with the healing.” Why bother?
 I wondered.
 It would be another day of bombardment with mountain fixtures… maybe whole trees this time.
 My face pinched with annoyance and Chevelle threw me a piece of dried meat, barely holding back a smile as he jumped on his horse.
 “You’d better get started,” he said, “it’s going to be a long walk.” As he kicked his heels, I spun toward the corner where my horse had been.
 He was galloping up the mountain now, just over a hundred yards away.
 I tried to think quickly, to keep the anger from slowing my response.
 Using magic to pull Chevelle’s horse by the tail, I ran after him, hoping to leap on.
 A tree branch came from nowhere and smacked me flat across the face.
 Chevelle’s horse whinnied as they rode away.

He was so furious it looked like he was only seconds away from exploding.
 A very pretty Hispanic girl placed a gentle hand on his arm, but he shook her hand off and let out a sound that was uncomfortably close to a growl.
 "You selfish jerk.
 You've been mooning over her for weeks.
 You've got her now, but at what cost?
 This isn't open to discussion.
 We're taking her back to Brandon and asking for leniency."
 In an effort to see better, Rachel and I had moved slightly to the side.
 Alec reached back without looking and moved us directly behind him.
 It wasn't until his arm brushed me that I realized he was shaking ever so slightly himself.

Rodregas thought she was going to take his hand for a second.
 With his free hand he made a fist and slammed the side of her head.
 Not with all his strength, but still a serious hit.
 She grunted and let go, growled and stepped over the bear’s body.
 He slowly reached up, and using the full strength of his body, pushed hard on her muscular chest, pushing her away from the bear’s haunch.
 He then ignored her and went back to cutting the haunch loose.
 He waited but the two lionesses seemed to have gone from aggression to napping, with him missing the transition.
 Slowly, Rodregas got up with his bear haunch and took it back to the barn.
 He met the surprised look of Doi’van and Imeralda with a half smile, “I hope you like the taste of bear?” As he was unsure of how old the meat was, he immediately started a fire and started to cook it.
 As he worked on preparing the fire he explained what had happened.

But, I was oblivious at the time.
 God bless Pete.
 He handled it all.
 While I was gone.
 Only he knew I was gone although we were incommunicado, no phone even.
 I think I called him once from town and said something like, “Don’t tell me about any of the shit that’s going down.
 Don’t tell me there are more kids dead at more universities.
 Don’t tell me about Nixon, Crafty or his reptilian lawyer.
 Just send me my guitar.
 I did--after a while I wanted it---get my guitar up there, up in my White River seclusion, but I only wanted it to serenade Lorelei.

I was confused and didn't have a chance to talk to my mother about it.
 I needed to and was going to, after I'd walked through the garden and thought about it and it was time for her to be awake .
 .

 but instead I walked into your garden, into 2011."
 The tears began flowing faster down her cheeks.
 "But I don't belong here.
 It’s as if-as if I’ve been abducted from my home and put in prison.
 A beautiful prison, yes--but still a place where I'm trapped."
 Rick stared at her, his throat thick and sore.

I don’t think any of us know what ‘The One Law’ is.
 Jordaan looked surprised, but then nodded.
 “It is a law set forth by both the Celestials and the Infernals.
 Do you know the source of Magic?” he asked her.
 Imeralda nodded, “Sure, there are four sources of magic: mortal, Celestial, Infernal and elemental.
 It is one of the reasons I am prized for my potential with more than one power.
 My AElven ancestry is strong with mortal magic, but my Nymph side is strong in elemental magic.
 If an Immortalist takes my power, he or she could become stronger in both.” “Mostly correct,” Jordaan said.
 “It is actually a topic of much debate among magicians.
 I go along with the belief that there is no such thing as ‘mortal’ magic.

It'd be one less piece of my world crumbling out from under me.
 Britney slammed her tray down, but my listless gaze didn't move from the vacant corner where Brandon usually sat.
 A few minutes later a group of girls came to join us.
 I recognized them, but didn't bother putting names to the faces.
 It was like I got hit with another panic attack.
 Somehow I lost an hour, but nobody was running around calling for an ambulance so I must have at least responded to direct questions.
 Alec was sitting in his normal seat as I wandered into physics.
 I tried to remember whether or not I'd already heard the second bell ring.
 It wasn't important though.
 Not compared to the first thing I'd faced in hours that had the potential to hurt me.

Again that incredible smile flashed across his face.
 "They were touch and go for a little bit, but I'm most pleased with how everything worked out."
 I'd spent all of Monday in a daze, and felt much the same now, only this time it was a daze of good fortune.
 It hardly bothered me when Britney snubbed me during English.
 I flew through my Algebra assignment, finishing up the one from yesterday as well as the one Mrs. Campbell assigned, before the bell rang to release us.
 The only thing that even threatened my bubble of happiness was when I walked into the lunchroom and saw that Britney was sitting with the cheerleaders who'd come and sat at our table yesterday.
 It was blatantly obvious I wasn't welcome.
 Unsure where to sit, I almost spun around and walked back into the hall until Brandon caught my eye and waved me over.
 I had to detour around the tangle of tables that belonged to the closest thing Sanctuary had to real Goths.
 My wandering path brought me around to where I could see what I'd mentally dubbed 'Alec's corner'.

How did that happen?"
 Alec released my waist and spun me out and back in without missing a single step.
 I wished I could be so lucky, only the fact that his arm was like an iron bar allowed me to keep my misstep from resulting in a fall, or possibly a sprained ankle.
 "Donovan has very inflexible standards when it comes to some things.
 Dancing happens to be one of them.
 In fact, I don't think I'll ever forget the expression on Jasmin's face when he told her she could go clubbing all she wanted after he judged her suitably proficient in real dancing.
 He said he wouldn't have her 'seduced by throbbing beats and soulless contact' before he'd at least exposed her to proper dance steps."
 I felt a giggle surge past my lips, and pressed them tight before I could completely embarrass myself.
 "That's amazing.
 My dad thought knowing how to dance would make my first dance easier.

“Yeah, so?” Harruq asked.
 “So tomorrow don’t let me hit you,” she said.
 The half-orc mumbled and rolled his eyes.
 Aurelia leaned back against a tree, her eyes studying him.
 Her look gave him shivers, both good and bad.
 “Tell me about yourself,” she said.
 Harruq raised an eyebrow.
 “Your childhood.
 Your likes.
 Your life.”

I've noticed you've been working on the older material during class, which I very much approve of, but you may want to listen today.
 We're starting a new section, and it should be fairly straightforward for you to pick up."
 I shouldn't have been surprised when she turned out to be right.
 The new chapter was on probability, which had absolutely nothing to do with the stuff they'd been working on the week before.
 I quickly decided I didn't like the new stuff as much as what I'd been studying on my own, but it was relatively easy, and almost before I knew it class had ended and it was time to go to lunch.
 My doubts about whether or not everyone would be back in school today after three nights of partying were quickly resolved as Britney and I tried to fight through the ridiculous foot traffic on our way to our lockers.
 By the time we made it to the lunch room, I was heartily sick of dodging jocks with shoulders the size of an ox.
 Why on earth did every single one of them think it was necessary to mock fight, throw balls back and forth to each other, or otherwise make a spectacle of themselves?
 My mood was further soured as we arrived to find an unmistakable circle of bystanders signaling an impending fight.
 My first instinct was to go find a teacher before the two idiots hurt each other, but while I was still looking around to see if there was an adult in the room, Britney grabbed my arm and pulled me towards the circle.

Will you take me to wherever they are?"
 He dried his hands on a blisteringly white towel, and nodded.
 "Of course.
 I believe they are in the north end of the valley.
 Right this way."
 We made good time, even with Donovan's jerky, oftentimes painful gait, but the estate was even bigger than I'd realized.
 We walked for several minutes before rounding a corner and finding the entrance to a hedge maze.
 "We're very nearly there.
 The maze serves as a final barrier against unwelcome eyes."
 I was lost within seconds, before we'd made more than four or five turns.

Since my profession of faith, my only steps in God's direction were reading through the Bible, praying now and then, and getting baffled by J.D.
 Salinger's Franny and Zoey, about a girl who goes around constantly muttering "Lord Jesus Christ have mercy on us."
 Her family decides she's crazy, and I agreed.
 Hoping to keep the light alive, I visited several churches that gave me the creeps, with clammy skin and something like nausea, the same feeling I have gotten from the sallow eyes of anorexics who obviously courted suicide, and from remembering nights I had to spend with my sinister grandmother, the Christian Scientist.
 Another couple churches reminded me of the country club where I used to smash golf balls until I grew weary of the country club people.
 I tried a few college youth groups whose leaders appeared either self-righteous or too naive to offer much truth.
 After all, I surmised, they hadn't witnessed black people living on a quarter an hour, or attended many funerals, or gotten beat up for no reason and realized they could easily do murder.
 I felt as lost as Raskolnikov, in Crime and Punishment.
 Maybe my only hope was to find a Sonia.

“Why don’t we put all this stuff up and have it tomorrow?
 I’ll take you out to dinner tonight.” “You don’t have to do that.” “I bet you’d like to try out one of those buffets I told you about.” Her eyes widened.
 “A buffet?
 With lots of desserts?” He chuckled.
 “I know just the place.” Rick’s attentiveness calmed her, and she went to bed that night with a full stomach and an odd sense of security.
 Nothing about what had happened to her made sense, but Rick was right.
 If she had to walk out of 1927 into another time, she was fortunate she’d walked into his time.
 The week went by quickly.
 Marie always began the day with a walk in the garden, and Rick always hugged her and dried her tears when she returned.
 When he left for work, she'd exercise and watch movies he'd rented for her and clean the house with the supplies she'd discovered.

After everything you've done, I know you wouldn't hurt me."
 Alec turned towards Rachel, but she shook her head before he could even open his mouth.
 "You don't even need to ask.
 I'll follow your lead, and try to look brave."
 He threw the door open and stalked into the house.
 Rachel grabbed my hand and pulled me along behind her.
 A group of familiar faces was waiting for us in the largest living room I'd ever seen.
 It took me several seconds to match identities to the rain-soaked group staring at me with such hostility.
 Jasmin was standing in the center, and didn't even wait for me to get fully in the room before she started talking.
 "She goes back to Brandon tonight.

Lack of food and employment are the basis for the poverty that still afflicts one-fifth of humankind.
 When it comes to food there can be no justification or excuse – everyone must have enough to eat, and can have enough.
 A world dedicated to upholding the political rights and property rights of nations and individuals cannot fail to recognize and enforce the most fundamental of all human rights – the right to live.
 Contrary to the fears raised in earlier centuries and revived in recent decades, today the world does possess the capacity to feed everyone, even at current levels of food production – subject as it is to disincentives, quotas, restrictions and trade barriers that food surplus countries impose to curtail food production, while other nations remain in perpetual deficit.
 In spite of a doubling of population in the developing countries since 1960, their average food supplies have increased from 1950 calories to 2475 calories per capita per day, or from an average of 90 per cent to 107 per cent of the minimum caloric requirement.
 During the past 12 years alone, per capita food production in developing countries has risen by 15 per cent.
 Overall, the proportion of people in developing countries suffering from hunger and mal nutrition has dropped dramatically both in relative and absolute terms, from 941 million people constituting 36 per cent of the population of these nations in 1970 to 781 million constituting less than 20 per cent of the population in 1990.
 Current projections indicate that the growth rate in world agricultural output will continue to exceed population growth over the next two decades.
 By 2010, food grain production is expected to reach four times the level in 1960.
 Increased production of other food crops is expected to raise per capita availability in the developing world to 2700 calories per day.

“Uh, no, I’m not.
 I don’t know what a light pixie is or why you saved my life, but thank you” I said, trying not to snap back.
 “Well you are a half-ling and we need as many of them as we can get,” She pointed out.
 “Plus I’m not evil, so why shouldn’t I help you out?” “Uh thanks I guess.” This situation was extremely awkward to me.
 She winked and disappeared in a flash.
 I limped over to my body ignoring Seth’s yells to tell me to sit down.
 I felt the wind pick up and was whisked back to my normal self.
 I felt fine except for the fact it hurt to stretch my left side.
 I would probably be extremely stiff and sore tomorrow morning, but I was used to that feeling.
 We began to walk back towards the park when Jason stopped us.

My only living hero, according to Bobby, had become nothing more than a woeful drunk who sat brooding over his liquor until closing time.
 Then, most every evening, he went home with whatever washed out female lasted so long.
 Raskolnikov
 While Bob and I drove home in a 1952 Chevy we bought for $20 from Bobby Casso, I was a lousy companion.
 All I could think about were tragedies.
 Eric's death.
 Jack Kerouac, and how neither his talent, quests, travels, friends, lovers, nor his studies of Buddhism had saved him from a pitiful life.
 I wondered if all the highs, mind trips, love affairs and communions he had written about were cover-ups for his soul's desperation.
 I had found the real world to be at least as tragic, seamy, unjust and dangerous as Billy Graham preached.
 Thinking of Billy Graham reminded me that the light I had noticed from the shore of the Tia Juana river was growing dim.

The elf reached the end of the ice, turned, and went sliding back.
 The two she had cut were on the ground, unable to stand after such precise hits.
 As she reached them, she stabbed one of their legs to halt her momentum, yanked her sword free, and then rolled around to stab the other in the throat.
 Another roll back, and she delivered the first soldier the same fate.
 The elves they saved wasted no time recovering.
 They both pressed forward, unafraid of fighting on the ice.
 Their light armor made balancing an easy task while their human counterparts were doing all they could to swing and stand at the same time.
 Two men fell to each of their blades, bringing the total down to four.
 As Felewen lay upon the ice, a soldier stabbed down at her.
 She spun on her rear, her sword out in an arc.

“Ow,ow,ow, get the heck off me!” I slashed downward and the frost beast let go of my leg.
 It zipped between my legs and launched itself at my left leg.
 I stepped to the side and slammed my foot on the beast’s back.
 It yipped and went still.
 I raced through the crowds, jumping and ducking.
 I looked over my shoulder and up the hill, wishing I could escape all the bodies that were pressed together in combat.
 Then I rammed into one.
 “What the heck?” I fell on my butt and blinked as Jason picked himself off the ground.
 “Sorry,” I said and stood up.
 “Watch where you’re going… Jazell, look out!” Jason suddenly yelled.

“So why are you here?” she asked.
 “I was just, um, I never got a chance to thank you.” Harruq felt his face flush.
 This was the most awful thing he had ever done.
 He’d prefer to face a dragon in unarmed combat.
 He’d have better odds surviving, too, based on Aurelia’s cold, steeled look.
 “You came all the way out here to thank me?
 Hardly sounds like an orcish thing to do.”
 One would not have thought gray skin could turn so red, but it did.
 “Well, I still want to repay you.” Harruq held out a small bag containing copper coins.
 “It’s all I have.

He wished the information about her marriage to Davis hadn’t disappeared.
 He could have shown her what her life would be like if she married him.
 But why couldn’t he just tell her what the article had said originally?
 She could draw her own conclusions about what the change in the article meant.
 Excited, he stood and headed for her room.
 But when he reached her door, he hesitated.
 Would she believe him about the article?
 She still felt loyal to that jerk, and she might not believe him.
 Especially since it was pretty obvious that he himself had something to gain by convincing her that she shouldn’t marry Davis.
 His sister had once told him that a girl usually wouldn’t even believe her best friend if she told her that her boyfriend was cheating on her.

When Velixar had first given the strength to him, he’d felt an overwhelming desire to use it.
 Anger swelled inside, and when he looked to Aurelia he felt an enormous desire to attack.
 She was questioning his master, his brother, questioning what it meant to be him.
 When he opened his eyes, Aurelia stood, shocked by the red light wafting like smoke from Harruq’s eyes.
 “You could never know what I am,” he said.
 “I’ve seen what you can be,” she said.
 “Is that not enough?”
 The words stung him.
 His vision swam crimson.
 He felt his hands close upon his swords.

The wave continued down the street, straight for Aurelia.
 “I do not fear you,” she hissed through clenched teeth.
 A wall of water swirled about her, flowing from the otherwise dry dirt street.
 She sent it forward, just as tall and high as Velixar’s.
 The two met in a thunderous roar, intermixing in a maelstrom of darkness, water, and air.
 Then they both dissolved, their magic spent.
 Aurelia held back tears.
 Velixar’s magic had peeled the flesh from the elves’ bodies.
 Blood leaked through muscle and tendon, and their innards spilled from their abdomens.
 She hoped they died instantly, but she knew better.

Faced with the abundance of evidence and the thought of five years in prison, Brandon broke and agreed to bust a dealer named Steve.
 The interesting thing about Steve was that much of the information the officers had on Brandon was from Steve.
 It’s quite a tangled web.
 Steve had been busted some time ago and released when he agreed to work with the narcotics division of the police department.
 Steve’s bust was kept a secret so he could fold back into the drug world unnoticed and collect information on drug dealers like my son and share that information with the officers so they could set up these dealers.
 Steve was tasked with introducing undercover officers into the inner circle that would eventually lead to a bust that appeared to be far removed from the original contact with Steve.
 The only problem with Steve is that he was double-crossing the narcotics officers and they had come to discover his deception.
 Steve and his girlfriend, Ashley were highly addicted to Oxy and their combined drug habit made it necessary for him to continue to deal Oxy to the bigger buyers while tossing a few small fish to the officers to appease them and satisfy his deal.
 The officers knew too that Steve was beating his girlfriend and forcing her to perform “happy ending massages” and sexual favors to support her personal addiction to Oxy.
 Brandon was one of the small fish that Steve provided information on.

He introduced the man on the right, who stepped to the mike and silenced the crowd with a hymn.
 Billy Graham followed, and began to speak with such gentle authority, he stopped my eyes from wandering to the neck of the babe with auburn curls.
 Billy Graham quoted from a Bible prophet, in a manner that made me feel prophesied to.
 He commanded, Learn to do well, relieve the oppressed and the fatherless, plead for the widow.
 Come now, he said, and let us reason together.
 Though our sins are as scarlet, they can be as white as snow.
 If only we’re willing and obedient, we can reap the good of the land.
 And he warned us.
 The hydrogen bomb had cast its shadowy threat of annihilation over the whole earth.
 Sooner than we imagined, the basic power of the universe would be given into the hands of mad men.

Even if this intention cannot immediately be made effective, the adoption of this Peace Imperative would mark a milestone in human affairs.
 There is no rational or practical obstacle to the immediate adoption of this measure.
 As a starting point, it can be demonstrated that with the right perspective, courage and commitment, practical immediate solutions are possible for any and all of the conflicts presently raging.
 Recent failures of international diplomacy do not contradict this assertion, they confirm it.
 War must, and can, be abolished.
 Nuclear Weapons
 The threats to future peace come in many forms and at many levels, but unquestionably the most pernicious and potentially devastating is the peril from nuclear weapons.
 The end of the nuclear arms race between the superpowers may have removed the looming fear of all-out nuclear war and annihilation that surfaced in the artistic drawings of young American school children in the mid-1980s, but the horrible genie of Hiroshima and Nagasaki will continue to haunt us until every nuclear weapon has been destroyed.
 The very existence of the nuclear stock piles carries its own inherent dynamism for their utilization, which is likely to be expressed intentionally or accidentally sooner or later.
 There have been repeated efforts by the non-aligned nations to move a resolution in the UN General Assembly that the use of nuclear weapons should be declared a crime against humanity and outlawed.

Then, warning him to be ready, she dropped down one of the fruits which he caught with his normal grace.
 “Stay on the root,” she warned him.
 “You cannot take one of the blessings off the tree; it will wither and die if you try.” She winked at Rodregas as she said this.
 Imeralda then proceeded to eat the acorn shaped fruit; it took some work.
 It seemed to be a bit harder than any ripe fruit Rodregas knew of, but he followed her example and found that while it was tart it was amazing.
 It tasted of... Rodregas did not know what to call the flavor; the words that came to mind were sunlight and rain and the smell of a forest at night.
 When Rodregas finished the fruit completely he felt more whole but was also sad that it was gone.
 Imeralda seemed in great humor.
 “Come on,” she said.
 She dropped to her hands on the edge of the branch and then dropped down as if she was only feet from the ground which, strangely she was.

“The two of us have become friends, even though I am a Hellborn.
 In me flows the blood of the Daemons of the Infernal.” He paused and then his voice cracked, showing a trace of a deep emotion for the first time “Yet, you treat me like a man.
 You must do the same for Imeralda, for you two to be lovers you must learn to share her with others.
 She has a lot of love to give.
 Do not be so selfish as to want it all to yourself.” With that he gave a punch to Rodregas’ side, causing Rodregas to grunt in pain, and Doi’van followed the other two out the door.
 Rodregas laid in the bed, his mind whirling with thoughts.
 At first he thought about the implications of what Jordaan had shared.
 But, then his mind went back again and again over his and Imeralda’s time during the last few weeks and then back to Doi’van’s words.
 He knew his friend spoke the truth, but he was not so sure about his ability to do what he needed to keep his relationship with the beautiful AElven Nymph.

And even as he half fell backwards he used the momentum to slide down and try to land a blow low under the shield.
 Rodregas had both quickness and strength on his side.
 He blocked the blow with his sword and then bashed down quick and hard multiple times with his shield.
 He thought he heard a bone break.
 Rodregas paused and the knight signaled him as victor with a finger to the Heavens.
 Rodregas followed this pattern throughout the day.
 He kept using his sword more to block than to attack and kept using his shield offensively.
 This allowed him to take advantage of his unnatural strength to overwhelm his foes.
 According to the contest rules, he could replace his shield after every fourth match if need be.
 By the final match, he was on his third and final shield.

There was a vaguely irritating noise behind me that didn't seem to fit with what I expected from school.
 I thought about turning to see what it was, but was thankfully too far back into the gauze to act on the thought.
 I went back to contemplating the pair of ants that were currently trekking across my right foot.
 "Adriana.
 Are you okay?"
 My insides were too raw.
 Just coming out long enough to listen to Mrs. Campbell had opened everything back up.
 My mind tried to shy away, to sink away from the certainty of more jagged shards being shoved into me, but this voice was an important one.
 Rachel looked down at me, her arms wrapped around her waist as if trying to hold herself together.
 "What are you doing?"

He was still backing away, holding his hands in front of him palms out.
 A wordless hiss escaped my throat as I felt the fire coursing through me light in my hands.
 He would burn for this.
 Burn.
 I was standing now, walking step for step toward him as he backed away.
 He said nothing, his face calm as the fire flared and I raised my hands to strike.
 And then everything went black.
 That was when I heard the chanting.
 My ears had been roaring with anger, but all that was left was a soft recitation.
 “Gian Zet Foria.

When I entered the bird again, something was wrong.
 It wasn’t only the bird, someone was there.
 Someone else.
 The shock of it threw me back to my own mind.
 My eyes shot open and I scanned the scene again.
 I forgot what I was looking for when I recognized a face, hooded in a cloak, fighting against her own.
 Junnie.
 She stared back at me for one brief moment before she turned to fight some invisible foe.
 The stunned moment took the last of the borrowed courage from me, and I drew in, afraid, as my body remained encaged in vine and thorns.
 My legs were wet with blood, arms deadened to the pain and cold.

Just give me a straight answer or I can’t do anything.
 It all comes down to this.
 What is coming?
 I cried out in frustration.
 It didn’t reply to me again, so I continued to walk down the hill.
 What did I have to stop?
 What was so important?
 Why wasn’t I allowed a straight answer in this stupid world?
 I heard a faint clang ahead.
 I walked faster and with ever step the noise got louder.

Liz – What does that mean?
 Centralized Base of Operations?
 Johnny – Yeah, he only lives a mile away from here.
 Jim – I just think its part of his master evil plan to piss you off.
 Seems that Gene has once again scored a point for the forces of darkness.
 I wonder if he’s working for the Canadians.
 You guys ever seen Gene drink beer and watch hockey?
 Johnny – I don’t watch Gene do anything.
 I just wish he’d get outta here.
 Jim – Maybe if you’re lucky, and ask nicely, he’ll teach you about Canada.

“Velixar’s strong.
 What do you think he wants with us?”
 “Order,” Qurrah said.
 “We will kill, brother.
 It is all we are good at.
 It was what we were made for.
 What other purpose do you see for your life?”
 Harruq shrugged.
 “I said it before.
 I’m here to protect you.”

Strangely enough, it didn't seem like he was necessarily mad, but he didn't seem happy either.
 I only caught his eyes for a few seconds before he looked away, but even his normally riveting blue eyes couldn't distract me from my inability to identify the look.
 I was used to people disliking me, ignoring me, or even occasionally liking me, but this was the first time I'd met someone who seemed to be still trying to decide what camp to join long past the time when most kids our age would have either made a decision or just decided I was weird and started ignoring me.
 Britney seemed to be getting suspicious that I wasn't really listening, so I had to make a lot of eye contact over the next few minutes.
 When I finally got a chance to look back up, Alec and his friends weren't at their table.
 Cassie caught my eye before I looked down, but she was definitely glaring.
 Not the typical I-hate-you-and-I'm-going-to-do-everything-I-can-to-smear-your-reputation-and-get-you-in-trouble-because-we're-in-high-school-and-that's-all-I can-really-do type glaring.
 Instead her eyes seemed to warn me never to go out alone at night because if she ever found me somewhere without any witnesses, they were going to have to hospitalize me.
 I felt a chill run through me, and dropped my eyes out of involuntary reflex.
 I probably would've started shaking if someone hadn't grabbed my shoulder and startled some kind of twisted cross between a shriek and a gasp out of me.

The entourage of police came out of parking spots and the marked cars came from behind the building and out of nowhere.
 It was as if a sudden parade had emerged from nowhere folding in behind me as I exited the parking lot.
 I arrived at the original briefing spot and I got out of the truck and the lead officer immediately began to tell me this was a good first contact and that I would get them.
 I tried to interrupt him with my feelings of distress but he would have no part of it.
 He complimented me on holding my ground so firmly.
 In fact, he and his partner asked me if I had done this before because I was so stern with her and refused to bend.
 I guess they were accustomed to dealing with strung out drug addicts.
 I was still completely disappointed and I told them so.
 I just wanted this over and I had every expectation that it would be finished tonight and I could get on with my life and my son could get on with rehab and hopefully get healthy.
 Once I was un-wired I was able to call my wife who was a sobbing mess.

(Starts walking towards the door)
 Jim & Liz – Wait where are you going?
 Eugene – I’m going to test out my new name.
 There’s gotta be a few Japanese tourists somewhere around town.
 I am GODZILLA!
 (Walks off stage)
 Liz – He’s not going to get himself hurt is he?
 Jim – Hard to say, this has got to be more harmless than some of the other things he was doing though.
 Most likely he’ll just get chased off by some angry tourists.
 Liz – What’s he done that is worse than this?

Do you mind if I give you a ride home on Tuesdays and Thursdays?"
 Did I mind?
 Of course not.
 "That would be really great.
 Thanks for offering."
 Brandon ran one finger down the side of my face, and then leaned back with a smile as I reached for the door.
 It wasn't until I was out of the car that I realized our Jeep was parked in its normal spot off to the side of the house.
 Excited to talk to Mom about her last outing, I waved goodbye to Brandon and hurried to the door.
 Mom hardly even looked up from her laptop as I walked in.
 Whew, no need to go through the third degree about Brandon.

"How soon will we know if it's really bad or just a little bad?"
 "I don't know.
 Things were already pretty tense.
 That's probably where Alec is right now actually.
 Brandon's people are always skirting around the edge of our territory, but tonight they'll be out in greater numbers than normal.
 If things don't boil over now, it's pretty much guaranteed that there will be some kind of confrontation Monday at school."
 The word confrontation reached out and grabbed me.
 It took a second before I realized it was dragging up memories of the near-fight between Alec and half his pack.
 "What happened last night...it was for real, wasn't it?"
 Rachel didn't ask what I meant; she didn't even bat an eye.

We focus on that and practice constantly.
 That way it becomes easier, uses less energy, you know.” I didn’t know.
 “Maybe we should see what your strong suit is,” she said and motioned me to follow her as she walked to the rock ridge and jumped over, hurrying down to the men.
 “Sorry to interrupt, gentlemen,” she announced.
 “I was wondering if you’d mind a little demonstration?” They broke their circle to give her their attention.
 “Frey here hasn’t found her rhythm yet,” she explained.
 They seemed to understand and she bounded back over to me and drew me to sit beside her on a large rock facing the men before cueing them to begin.
 The largest stepped forward, boasting deep brown hair and eyes.
 He wore plain clothing but his broad shoulders and massive size made him seem regal.
 “They name me Anvil but I am Reed, of Keithar Peak.” His voice was thick, though it was impossible to tell whether it was an accent or he had difficulty speaking.

There was even the expected contingent of jocks, obviously there just because a coach or parent had delivered some kind of ultimatum.
 Britney predictably headed over and staked out a table as close as she could get to a group of girls who were probably cheerleaders.
 Clustered around the other end of the room were the more studious kids, the kind who were generally pretty smart, but for whatever reason were struggling with math.
 I wasn't surprised to see a kind of a no-man's-land between the two ends of the spectrum.
 I was startled to see that the middle ground was inhabited by an attractive girl a year or two younger than me.
 Left to my own devices, I would've normally picked a table over on the nerd end of the room, but I found myself relating more to the girl stuck in the middle.
 She looked up and met my gaze for just a second before ducking back down and concentrating on her homework.
 Shy, obviously, and not popular.
 There'd been the hint of a smile on her face, possibly constrained by fear of how her overture might be received.
 Obviously a complete social reject just like me.

“So be it.”
 Elves appeared in the windows of every building that lined the center.
 Full quivers hung from their backs.
 Sixty more elves joined their lone companion on the street and readied their bows.
 The men in the center raised their shields, but they knew the deadly aim of a trained elf.
 They were about to be massacred.
 “Stand firm!” Antonil ordered, raising his own shield.
 “Stand firm.
 Do not break formation!” A shout came from the elven side, and then the hail began.
 More than a hundred arrows rained down on the army, each deathly precise in its aim.

The pit in his stomach suddenly didn’t seem so awful.

 [section break](break.png)
 “Aurelia!” Dieredon screamed to the wilderness.
 Birds whistled, but no elven voice spoke back.
 “Aurelia!” he shouted again, wincing at the pain in his chest.
 After arriving in town, he had found one of his stashed healing potions and downed it.
 His ribs had gone from several pieces to just a single break, and his shoulder was slowly regaining strength.
 It would still be days before he was back to full health, days he did not have to spare.
 “I’m here,” Aurelia said after the third yell from Dieredon.

 She hugged her mother.
 "I love you, Mother.
 And I need--" "Marie?

 John had come in search of them.
 "Are you all right?"
 "We're just having a mother/daughter talk," Mrs. Tranton said as Marie reached for a napkin.

I must say some of the combinations she used were quite imaginative.
 Karen – Were they?
 I think I’d like to hear them then, too bad you can’t get away with calling that art.
 Art – Why couldn’t you?
 Karen – The censors would have a conniption.
 Then all to them all the parental groups tearing their hair out and protesting.
 It would be pure chaos.
 Art - Some people say that there isn’t any such thing as bad publicity.
 Besides, she could just call it a performance piece, as someone who has seen the show already, that girl performs when she curses.
 It’s a sight to see, I just can’t tell whether it’s a natural wonder or a natural disaster.

You dig?
 I was wrestling with these things, absurd things, but I couldn’t see clearly.
 All I saw was blackness, the blackness of dried blood.
 I don’t know what Crafty and Skippy thought—I didn’t even leave them a note.
 I feel bad about it now—and this, finally, I think, was what pissed Crafty off and led him to hire a lawyer for himself, to try and, you know, basically, steal my material.
 It was like, if you’re not gonna represent yourself well, we’re gonna take away your soul, all your work, all your history.
 Shit.
 That shark he hired---what a bastard.
 But, I was oblivious at the time.
 God bless Pete.

He charged the elf, abandoning any hint of precaution.
 He slammed his blades down with all his might.
 The elf blocked once, twice, then three times, wincing each time he did.
 Then the other elf was behind Harruq, stabbing at his back.
 While mad with rage, Harruq still knew very well where his opponents were.
 He spun, avoiding the thrust, and then trapped his assailant’s arm with his elbow.
 A flex of his muscles cracked bone, and the sword fell from a limp hand.
 Harruq let him go, bellowed at the first elf, and then hurled both his blades.
 They turned end over end through the air, one missing, one not.
 The one that missed sailed until it hit ground and bounced.

In the bars, we saw girls get used by both men and farm animals.
 A few times we rode in taxis to motels where prostitutes greeted us.
 We would barter, object to the price, and leave while the coarser of them screeched obscenities.
 Some cabbies, after three or four such stops, stoically delivered us back downtown.
 Others pulled up beside a gang of thugs.
 Then we ran for our lives.
 The night Eric joined us, so did big Mike Beatty.
 He was about 6’6”, 280 pounds.
 We rode with a cabby to three motels.
 After the first, Eric said, “This is bad, Ken.

The next morning is sunny, the only dry day I will see while in Portland, according to the weather report.
 So Bob and I head out for a day of whacking golf balls into the marshes beneath some snowcapped peaks across the Columbia River in Washington.
 Because Portland’s main attractions are its brewery pubs, after golf we stop at one of them.
 On two of the too many televisions is the women’s college softball World Series.
 I watch the pitchers, studying their moves.
 Zoë is a softball pitcher too.
 She was the ace of her eight and under team.
 The season just ended a few weeks ago.
 For a project in her second grade class, she wrote and illustrated a book, which her teacher bound, entitled The Fast Friendly Pitcher’s Bad Remembering Day.
 I suppose if I live another thirty years, my eyes will still mist when I think of my girl as the fast friendly pitcher.

She'd have a family here, and that would make up for the family she had in 1927.
 They swam and played in the surf, but Marie thought Rick seemed very sober.
 Did he think she was still angry with him?
 Maybe he wasn't feeling well.
 Taking his hand as they returned to their blanket, she asked, "Are you feeling all right, Rick?"
 "Yeah, I'm fine."
 "Why don't we go home so you can rest since you have to go to work tomorrow?"
 "It's still early."
 "We've been here several hours already.

They belong to my son.
 He is the real drug dealer.
 I’m just trying to be a good dad.
 My last conversation with Ashley seemed a little muffled and the cops want to make sure they get a clear recording of the drug deal.
 The reason I am here and have insisted that I do this is complicated.
 I think I am here to save my family the anguish of watching another family member go to jail, not wanting to relive the time I watched my brother Thomas go to a federal prison for dealing drugs many years before.
 Maybe I am here because I just don’t know how to be a father and despite my attempt to be the best father I never had, I have failed miserably!
 Officer White coaches me through the sound check.
 Apparently the microphone at my jacket collar is slipping down and everything is muffled.
 I am told to pull it up, but warned that it might easily disconnect and if it did, the bust would be aborted.

BG:  	Right now I’m callin’ it Great Expectations.
 CM: 	Uh—
 BG: 	Move on, man.
 CM:  	At this point in your life, Buddy, are you a religious man?
 Some of your work hints at it—but it’s subtext, it’s buried.
 BG: 	Lately, for whatever reasons, I have been thinking more about the spiritual side of the human animal than ever I have in my previous twenty-some year tenure on Spaceship Earth.
 It probably has to do with getting older, finding my stability in Lor.
 Time at least to take a peak into the spiritual caldron.
 There are miracles, it might cause one to whisper, alone in the dark.
 I’m not comfortable, really, man, talking about my numinous side, as interesting as I think that is.

I remembered the tree and was suddenly afraid for him.
 Would Anvil use the same method on a person?
 A thunderous crack answered my unspoken question.
 The lightning bolt was faster than my eyes at such a close distance, by the time I looked at Steed, there was nothing but a wall of water.
 He had constructed a barrier of sorts, caught the strike and redirected it around himself by melting the snow that spotted the mountain.
 Anvil was winded, though the strike wasn’t as severe as his previous show.
 Steed would unquestionably be the winner now and as he took aim to retaliate, his opponent raised his hands in surrender.
 “Quick thinking, Mister Summit.” The large man grinned and I was in no doubt they were old friends.
 Chevelle stepped forward then, eager.
 I had a feeling he’d been itching for this the way I’d been itching to burn Ruby.

"I'm sorry I wasn't around yesterday.
 Some things came up that demanded my attention."
 The music was lower than usual, a possible sign he wanted to talk?
 "Did you manage to resolve them successfully?"
 Again that incredible smile flashed across his face.
 "They were touch and go for a little bit, but I'm most pleased with how everything worked out."
 I'd spent all of Monday in a daze, and felt much the same now, only this time it was a daze of good fortune.
 It hardly bothered me when Britney snubbed me during English.
 I flew through my Algebra assignment, finishing up the one from yesterday as well as the one Mrs. Campbell assigned, before the bell rang to release us.
 The only thing that even threatened my bubble of happiness was when I walked into the lunchroom and saw that Britney was sitting with the cheerleaders who'd come and sat at our table yesterday.

The power behind its head was such that it almost knocked him over.
 He had seen small house cats make similar gestures, but it was disconcerting to have two powerful predators such as the Dire Cats being so friendly.
 “I guess this means we are part of the pride,” said Imeralda, slowly reaching over and giving the other cat a tummy rub.
 Rodregas held his breath, as the cat responded with its paws by stretching out, its claws popping free with the stretch.
 They showed no signs of aggression, but just looking at the size of their claws, and then at Imeralda, made Rodregas want to jump over the Dire Cat and put his body in front of her.
 Rodregas was fully aware of how one swipe of those claws would likely kill her.
 Unlike the house cats that he was familiar with, Rodregas could see a kind of intelligence in their eyes.
 He had the feeling they both knew to be careful with a fragile mortal, and they thought it was funny that he was so worried.
 This scene repeated itself almost every night, and several times the cats also brought game they had killed into the farmyard.
 Rodregas made a point of always taking a piece of the kill, as for some reason he felt this was expected as part of their adopted group.

The half-orc shifted uncomfortably, unable to meet Aurelia’s eyes.
 He watched her trace lines in the grass.
 Seeking a way to lighten the mood, he asked her how to spell his name.
 “Harruq?” she asked.
 “Hrm.
 My best guess would be H-a-r-r-u-k.”
 A soft blow of air from her lips turned the grass to dirt so that a large space lay available for her to write on.
 She wrote ‘Harruk’ in the dirt with her finger, spacing out each letter.
 Harruq stared at the words representing his name, feeling a tiny thrill.
 “How about my last name, Tun?”

The guard captain smiled, somehow heartened by the sight.
 “Let us hope for miracles,” he whispered to the night.
 “And let us hope that at tomorrow’s end all my troops are still alive.”
 He stared at the stars for a long while before joining his troops in slumber.

 Harruq and Qurrah waited anxiously at their door.
 They were fully armed and ready.
 The half-orc’s sister swords were sharpened and gleaming.
 Wrapped around his arm, Qurrah’s whip writhed hungrily.

Marie gasped, her fingernails digging into his shoulders.
 She would never have dreamed that being pinned beneath Rick's body would feel so incredibly .
 .

 incredibly .
 .

 She moaned, letting her head drop back against the roof of the car as he began kissing her neck.
 "I love you, Marie," he whispered, nuzzling her ear.
 He raised his head, wanting to see her face.

 Jim – Will you do the honors Liz?

He was a volunteer.
 I seethed for a moment, but flashes of my mother and council cloaks flooded my thoughts and I had to block them.
 “So the North… has no council at all?” His answer was uncomfortable.
 “No.
 No council.” He paused while he formed the rest of his reply.
 Steed watched him, intent.
 “We are… unruled.” “Unruly,” Steed added with a laugh.
 “You’ve never had a council?” Grey shook his head.
 “No rulers?” He gave Steed a sidelong glance.
 “Not anymore.” I could tell he intended to end the conversation with that but it only made me more curious.

To save him.
 My boy.
 Brandon.
 I set an appointment with the arresting officers.
 I arrived at the police station with Brandon and we were escorted to an interview room.
 We were sitting in the police station in a county that is known for being tough on drugs and prosecuting everything to the fullest ability of the law.
 The door opened to a closet-size room with a table and four chairs.
 The walls were stark white and the room could barely accommodate the meager furnishings.
 Officer White and his Sergeant entered the room and sat opposite us.
 They were unrelenting that Brandon owed them a bust, no matter their mistake.

"Here!
 I'm lost!"
 But then she saw him and ran to him, throwing her arms around him.
 "I couldn't get back home!"
 "Shhh, shhh--it's all right."
 He hugged her, rocking her gently.
 "How am I going to get back, Rick?
 Am I stuck here forever?"
 "Come on--let's go have some breakfast, and we'll see what else we can think of."
 She let him lead her back to his house.

"...wanted to talk to you about what happened today."
 Part of me wanted to wait and see what he was going to say, to lose myself in what was sure to be a very convincing lie designed to make him look good, and me feel like I was on heroin for however long he favored me with his presence.
 Luckily that idealistic, stupid part of me had seen too many girls get used by smooth-talking boys.
 I interrupted right away.
 "You mean when your sister nearly got beaten by that whore, and you not only didn't do anything, you stopped your friends from doing anything either."
 Alec flinched a little.
 I was a little surprised by how satisfying it was to have him, a demigod, on the run, but I didn't let it slow me down.
 "The fact that I, a little waif from out of town, could defuse the situation and save Rachel no doubt sticks in your craw, which explains why you're lurking around out here waiting to talk to me.
 Because only then can you fabricate some reason for why everything had to go down the way it did, and thereby save face!"
 He wasn't flinching now.

Like when we were kids, before Father’s ridiculous schedule.
 I shook off the memory of practice and focused on the human.
 “So, how old are you?” “Twenty-two,” he said, almost shamefacedly.
 At first, I was shocked at the number; I thought maybe I’d misunderstood.
 But I remembered reading the human lifespan was very brief.
 I’d have guessed ten times that number if he were an elf.
 “Why the hint of embarrassment?” “They tell me I should have a family by now.” “You have none?” “A mother and father but none of my own.
 No wife, no children.” “You are expected to have a wife and child after just two decades of life?” He laughed for some reason I could not see.
 “Then you have no family of your own?” “I am not expected to pair for quite some time, if ever.
 And children?

Typically, youth comprise 65 to 75 per cent of the total unemployed.
 With the region’s population still growing at 3 per cent annually, these countries need to create 100 million new jobs in the coming decade just to maintain their present levels of unemployment.
 High population growth and a severe economic slowdown have generated high rates of unemployment in the Arab countries, estimated to exceed 25 per cent during the early 1990s, in spite of the very low labour participation rates among women in this region.
 In the aftermath of the Gulf crisis, labour-supplying countries such as Jordan, Lebanon, the Sudan and Syria have suffered the most.
 Returnees swelled Jordan’s population by 8.4 per cent and caused unemployment levels to rise above 20 per cent.
 Unemployment levels among Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank are among the highest in the world.
 A dramatic exception to this gloomy trend comes from the countries of Asia and the Pacific, which have made great strides in job generation during the 1980s and are poised to continue expanding rapidly.
 The Newly Industrializing Economies (NIEs) – Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan-China – are all facing severe labour shortages, with Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia also moving in that direction.
 But other Asian countries continue to face major challenges in creating sufficient jobs for all.
 China has created a phenomenal 100 million new jobs since 1985 and continues to grow rapidly, but the country still has a pool of 130 million surplus rural workers.

 Her mouth fell open.
 "You're betrothed?"
 "No, not yet.

But viewed in historical perspective, it is clear that substantial progress has been made during the post-war period, making humanity as a whole more prosperous than at any previous period in recorded history.
 Over the past five decades, global GDP has multiplied seven-fold.
 In spite of unprecedented population growth, per capita income has more than tripled.
 Between 1965 and 1985, real per capita consumption in the developing world rose by 70 per cent.
 Despite the paramount concern raised by the persis tence of high rates of unemployment in recent years, available data do not confirm a long-term trend towards rising rates of global unemployment.
 Prognosis for Employment in the Twenty-First Century
 Although it is difficult to make reliable employment projections based on past trends, we can say some things with a fair degree of certainty.
 In order to provide employment for every job seeker, the world needs to create approximately one billion new jobs during the next decade.
 This will require a job growth rate of more than 4 per cent per year compared to the less than 3 per cent achieved during the 1980s.
 About 95 per cent of the growth in the world labour force over the next 35 years will take place in developing countries.

Pale hands shot upward, hooked in strange formations.
 Dieredon stabbed a long blade straight at the man’s throat.
 The blade halted halfway there, crashing against an invisible barrier.
 The elf struck again, this time lower.
 Velixar’s image rippled as if beneath water, his body protected by some unseen wall.
 Faster and faster Dieredon swung, whirling his blades against where he perceived the wall to be.
 Power rippled in the air, black and deadly.
 As the elf fought against the shadow wall Velixar began another spell.
 Words of magic flew off his tongue in perfect pitch and pronunciation in spite of their incredible difficulty.
 A strong thrust from Dieredon finally shattered the invisible barrier but the explosion of power sent him flying backward.

“Can you run, brother?” Harruq asked.
 “No, I cannot.
 The night is long.
 I will hurry, but please let me rest when I must.”
 “Course I’ll let you rest when you need it.
 Come on, let’s go.”
 They stopped twice for Qurrah to catch his breath.
 His weak body gasped for air, sweat lining his face and neck.
 In the starlight, he looked so pale, so frail, that Harruq wondered how his brother could be so fearsome in combat.
 When they neared the firelight, they stopped to plan.

I just wanted to apologize for earlier."
 I shook my head violently.
 "No, you don't have anything to be sorry about.
 It...well, it was all so horrid.
 I can't imagine how hard it must be for you."
 Rachel stopped me before I could say anything else.
 "It's pretty rough, but not for the reasons you think.
 Mom isn't entirely healthy.
 Hasn't been since our father was killed.
 It isn't really her fault she behaves the way she does.

“Please don’t cry, sweetheart,” he said, taking the knife and mushroom from her and drawing her into his arms.
 “It’s just so confusing and frightening.”  She hid her face against his chest.
 “I don’t know how I got here, I don’t know why it happened, and worst of all, I don’t know how to get back.”  Her body shook with sobs.
 Rick’s heart broke for her.
 “I’m sorry, sweetheart,” he murmured, stroking her hair.
 As her sobs began to subside, he tightened his arms around her and pressed his lips to her ear to whisper, “Maybe you came to 2011 because there’s someone here to help you and care about you.” She pulled back a little and managed a small smile for him.
 “At least that’s an explanation I can live with.”  She took the handkerchief he offered her.
 He kissed her temple.
 “Why don’t we put all this stuff up and have it tomorrow?
 I’ll take you out to dinner tonight.” “You don’t have to do that.” “I bet you’d like to try out one of those buffets I told you about.” Her eyes widened.

Fall had always been Dad's favorite time.
 Cindi's had been spring--she hadn't minded the mud.
 My immunity was wearing off; the racing heart was a sure sign.
 I focused back in on what Mom was saying.
 "...you were doing so well.
 Don't worry; this is just a little setback.
 You'll see.
 Being in a different environment will do wonders for us both."
 I knew the rest of Mom's speech by heart, there was no reason to listen.
 Next she'd run through all of the famous, marginally well-known, or even really obscure photographers who got their start in the West.

She stuck her tongue out, “What do you have against sun-tanning penguins?” “Nothing!” I smiled to myself.
 I shouldn’t be talking; I was wearing pajamas covered in little pigs.
 Emily leaned back to turn off her desk light.
 It clicked off and I gazed outside one more time before turning around to go to bed.
 “Night Emily.” I yawned.
 Emily didn’t reply because her face was pushed up against the window.
 Her body was ridged and she didn’t move.
 I crawled over to the window.
 “What is it, Em?” I whispered, a nervous feeling creeping into my stomach.
 She backed away from the window so I could see.

Eradication of terrorism is possible, but it demands a comprehensive and integrated approach and concerted, collective action.
 The commercialization of the arms trade – which benefits some countries economically at the expense of the security of all nations – must be subject to rigorous monitoring and control by international agencies.
 Vested economic interests that thrive on conflict must be placed under UN surveillance and regulation.
 International institutions must be strengthened to eradicate arms smuggling, narcotics, offshore money laundering and other criminal activities that serve as seedbeds and instruments for terrorism.
 However, no final solution to the problem of terrorism can be arrived at by force alone.
 While terrorism is frequently attributed to religion and ideology, it sprouts and thrives most readily among populations that lack opportunities for gainful employment and economic development.
 Social unrest is an expression of the upward aspiration of those who have been left out of the political and development process or who feel threatened by the rapid pace and stress of social change and inequity.
 Those who lack the opportunity or the ability to labour intensely for their own upliftment express their productive energies through the intensity of violence.
 The international community cannot afford to be silent spectators of the growing violence.
 Peace, democracy and development are inseparable and interdependent.

By nightfall I wasn’t able to fend off anything that came at me and he mercifully stopped the horses beneath another hollow in the mountain.
 I was asleep practically before I slid off my horse.
 The next morning I woke to the sound of rock against rock.
 There was no sign of Chevelle or his horse in the dim stone hollow.
 I sat up, rubbing my sore legs, unable to believe he’d left me.
 And then the rock wall struck me in the face.
 I cursed, my voice hoarse from sleep.
 The wall came at me again.
 “Okay, okay,” I shouted.
 “Let me up.” Chevelle’s camouflage dissipated and he stared down at me, disappointed.

Apparently it was his turn to spend some time pondering his reply.
 My six-legged friend was joined by another of his kind, and they were manfully working their way up the hill towards a tree.
 "I've actually wanted to ask you for quite a while.
 Hearing that Brandon was taking you was harder for me to accept than you might imagine.
 My asking you now has nothing to do with our conversation from earlier today."
 "Why are you doing it now then?
 I half expected you to try and send me out of the country again.
 An invitation to the local equivalent to Prom was the last thing on my mind."
 The pair of ants disappeared, hidden among the lush grass that somehow managed not to look out of place here on the edges of the desert.
 I was starting to realize that the best way to get information out of a guy was to wait him out.

Even though such action was anathema to the very teachings of the Order, he had become an officer of the Immortal Guards, and eventually their leader.
 Several of the most powerful Knights had over the centuries, formed the officer core of The Immortal Guards.
 These Knights traded their honor for near immortality in the Guards.
 The Immortal Guards were all sigil warriors with one or several magical enhancements.
 They also had the best resources of the entire Eastern Realm, the most powerful enchanted armor, the best weapons; their officers rode Dire Beasts for steeds.
 Taking on a sigil warrior would be a huge challenge for Rodregas, or at least he thought it would be.
 He was still unclear of how strong and fast he was.
 His stomach hurt from his wound, but not as badly as it should.
 Clearly, the first step in his duty was to heal up from his wound and relearn how to fight in his new body.
 When he got up, Imeralda was already standing but Doi’van remained kneeling in thought.

Rachel and Brandon, both of who seemed to dislike the other, and neither of whom I was really sure I could count on.
 It was fine to only have two friends, or even just one friend if you knew they would do everything they possibly could to make sure they wouldn't let you down.
 It was entirely different when you weren't sure you could trust the people around you.
 Brandon was too good to be true.
 I pretty much expected any day now he'd come to his senses and realize he could do a lot better.
 Right or not, it's hard to really become emotionally invested when you feel like that.
 Rachel on the other hand should have been the perfect friend, but I got the feeling she'd always choose her brother over me.
 I felt guilty for holding that against her, family should be important.
 Cindi's friends back in Minnesota had probably felt similarly, but I'd always been really careful not to make her choose between me and them.
 Alec seemed like the type who'd force a decision just because he could.

Jim – I think he tones it down some.
 I think he’s gone through worse than I can imagine.
 Johnny – Why hasn’t he told anyone?
 Jim – He doesn’t like to have people pitying him.
 At least that’s how I think he works.
 Johnny – What does that have to do with anything?
 Jim – If everyone knew about him it would change how the acted towards him.
 They would treat him like he was special and give him more lee-way.
 Johnny – So, where’s the downside to that?
 Jim – It’s just not Gene’s way.

It was rather uncomfortable.
 You said my dad was a dirty old man, your mom…
 Liz – That Bitch.
 I told her to leave you alone.
 Is that why you don’t come over any more?
 Is that why you didn’t come to my pool party?
 Jim – I didn’t go to that because my swimsuit makes me look fat.
 Liz – Jim…
 Jim – Alright, your mother makes me extremely uncomfortable, with all her little smiles and suggestions and the pinching.
 With that on top of my swimsuit making me look fat, well I just didn’t feel up to it.

Classes, shit man, how could anyone concentrate on classes with that going on?
 Most of my teachers hated me anyway, you know, rock and roll, devil’s music, my hair was longer than most of my classmates, I insisted on wearing these combat boots, even in summer when sweating in them was like wearing a swamp on each foot, and I had attitude, of course.
 Rock and roll attitude.
 I was unassailable, untouchable.
 Of course the teachers hated me.
 One in particular, tried to get me expelled, suspended, something, because I wore an American Flag on my butt.
 (laughs)  It sounds funny now.
 I had this peace symbol, you know, the two finger symbol made of stars and stripes, and, Jesus, my mother sewed it on the back pocket of my jeans.
 This teacher—what was her name?
 was it freshman year, sophomore?

As soon as we were out of earshot, though I was still being dragged by the arm, I asked Chevelle, “Did something happen with the twins?” Ruby laughed.
 We both stared at her.
 “Twins,” she scoffed.
 “Right, well, you know what I mean,” I said, embarrassed.
 Chevelle’s tone softened.
 “No.
 Everything is fine.” Ruby chimed in, “It is fine,” and I was knew it was intended for him.
 He relaxed his grip on my arm and slowed our pace as he directed an almost imperceptible nod at Ruby.
 I relaxed, too; fine being better than anything I’d thought in a long while.
 Chevelle stayed in the front room that night, watching through the small windows.

"No."
 He closed his eyes.
 "What would you say if I told you you could go home tomorrow?"
 "I'd jump for joy.
 Why?"
 He squeezed the back of his chair, refusing to look at her.
 "Yesterday morning, after you went up to your room, I sat in the garden thinking about what your life in 1927 was like."
 His arms began to tremble.
 "I suddenly realized, when I looked out into the garden, that it was 1927."
 She gasped.

Even the kindest of folk would admit the town was not much more than an inn, a stable, the homes of the people that supported the local farming community, and of course, Raven Keep.
 Many of the keep employees and their family members lived in Raven Town.
 Luckily for Rodregas, there was a turn off almost immediately that let him circle around the edge of town and then start heading out of the valley.
 He went north toward the town of Cruet.
 As dusk was falling there was little traffic.
 Luckily this part of the road was well cleared and open and the horses were fresh so he made headway even as it became dark.
 He pushed hard until he reached the fork that headed west up into the hills.
 It was seldom traveled by anyone except fur trappers.
 Rodregas pushed on through the night and into the sunrise of the next day until even the horse that had been Korin’s ride, which he had tied to the back of the wagon, seemed to be tired and ready for rest.
 He stopped and let the animals take a break next to a small creek.

One Friday evening, she hosted a party.
 I drank several beers, then invited somebody who reminded me of Karen Flagstad to join me for a cruise up the coast road to La Jolla.
 Her name was Kris.
 She would go with me, she said, if not for a babysitting job she had that night.
 After she left, I drank more beer.
 Then I drove to a Jack in the Box on the coast road and found Kris there, in a Ford, hanging onto my cousin Jill’s boyfriend, Jimmy Dixon.
 Jimmy was one tough fellow.
 According to rumor, while fighting in the Golden Glove tournament, he had knocked another light-heavyweight into a coma.
 An equally tough surfer, Butch Van Artsdalen, rode shotgun.
 I strode to their car, jammed my head through rolled-down shotgun side window and stared at Kris.

"Thank you, sir--thank you very much."
 Davis shook his future father-in-law's hand.
 "I love my daughter dearly, but she can be quite a handful.
 A lot of romantic notions in her head, you know.
 That's why I keep such a tight rein on her, and I advise you to do the same.
 Of course, I'm sure that once she's married, she'll settle down and realize that life isn't like those picture shows and books that fill her mind with wild ideas."
 "I'm sure you're right, sir."
 Davis had no intention of letting her get away with the things her father did.
 Of course, she had the old man fooled, but Davis wasn't so easily deceived.
 Marie could tell that something was in the air that day.

“Do everything you can.
 Make her listen.”
 “I don’t want to kill her,” Harruq whispered.
 “Will you if you must?”
 The half-orc did not answer.
 Qurrah stepped around and stared into his brother’s eyes.
 “If we meet her on the field of battle, if we fight her, she might attack me instead of you.
 Her or me, brother.
 Who would you choose?
 Which of us will die?”

But I could never get the courage to do that.
 1… The wind died.
 My body felt normal except it was different.
 I opened my eyes and looked over to where I just had been or still was.
 My human body slightly glowed as it sat in meditation under the tree.
 It didn’t move.
 I could see the monster clearly now that I had stepped into its world.
 It was hunched over, occasionally touching the ground with one of its curled front paws.
 Dark saliva dripped out of its mouth.
 The beady black eyes made it no less scary.

Jim – Why are you asking me that?
 I don’t know her, and to be honest women confuse the hell out of me.
 All I know is that the only way to appease them is to offer sacrifices of flowers.
 Art – The flower trick is important, but it doesn’t always work.
 You need to remember to compose poems to their great beauty.
 That usually helps at least as much as flowers.
 Jim – What if she isn’t beautiful enough to deserve a poem.
 Art – Write a haiku then.
 Or a limerick, just make sure it isn’t dirty.
 It doesn’t matter, as long as you take time to make it sound good.

A couple of hours later at lunch, Mrs. Campbell had met the appearance of Rachel, Alec, and the rest of the pack with a raised eyebrow and a disbelieving headshake, but simply motioned them all over to the other side of the room, and handed me my test.
 Despite having spent weeks preparing for my makeup exam, I was still a little nervous until I started working the first problem.
 Forty minutes later I handed Mrs. Campbell a completed test, and got the extreme pleasure of watching her grade it and write a large, crimson 'A' on the front page.
 I was so excited I nearly squealed in delight.
 I managed to restrain myself, just barely, only to giggle as Rachel dropped her lunch and squealed for me.
 Dominic's gentle smile wasn't quite as enthusiastic, but I already knew her subdued reaction wasn't any less heartfelt.
 Throw in Jasmin's congratulations, which seemed to indicate the passing grade had been nothing less than inevitable, with Alec taking my hand as soon as I sat down, and Jessica and James' lack of response didn't matter at all.
 With Isaac's reassuring presence at my side in History, I weathered the renewed gossip, apparently occasioned by the entire pack's absence during lunch for the second day in a row, and soon found myself reunited with Alec in Physics.
 As luck would have it, Mrs. Alexander was gone again, and the substitute was typically clueless about what we were supposed to be doing.
 Alec of course spent the whole class unearthing other little bits of embarrassing information.

These negative consequences are primarily due to the fact that freedom has been extended to vast sections of the population which were confined in the past by rigid social barriers and minimum expectations, so they never had need or occasion to embrace the values they now eschew.
 The earlier self-restraint has been replaced by a self-assertion that has not yet acquired the productive values needed for achievement.
 Rising expectations enhance this tendency.
 While it is true that corruption is more prevalent today than ever before, it is also true that the entire global economy functions on the basis of a faith, honesty, openness and tolerance that would have been inconceivable in the past.
 We mourn the loss of cloistered values, which were very often accompanied by narrow rigidity and provincialism, while failing to recognize the enormous growth in positive human values that has made possible the incredible progress of the past few decades.
 In past centuries cultural values were handed down to future generations through the family.
 Education, which now focuses on the transfer of information, ideas and mental skills, can also impart development-oriented values such as open-mindedness, initiative and innovation.
 Integration and tolerance of diversity are crucial values for the further development of the human community.
 Yet the increasing speed of globalization has accentuated a contrary tendency toward increasing fragmentation.
 The pull of fragmentation cannot be countered solely at the political level.

 Not long after, Harruq rose, took his swords, and left for his own meeting.

 “You’re late,” Aurelia said, stepping out from behind a tree.
 Harruq shrugged and held out two branches he had whittled into crude imitations of swords.
 “Had to make something for me to spar you with,” he said.
 “Those sticks are unnecessary,” Aurelia said as she took up her staff, the tiniest hint of a smile curling on her lips.
 “Draw your swords.”
 “Are you sure?” Harruq asked, raising an eyebrow and gesturing to her completely unarmored figure.

“Well as far behind as we are, we might not even get the chance to try to bully our way in,” Rodregas said.
 Doi’van nodded and that comment seemed to end the conversation.
 As Rodregas headed out to the sands of the Cathedral arena for the jousting match, he was relieved to see Imeralda waiting at the entrance to talk to him.
 She had been out all night on her mission.
 “Well, I have to say I am very tired of talking so I will make this quick,” she said with her normal sunny smile.
 Rodregas had to admit she did look tired.
 “First, Geriodon is much disliked.
 He is gruff, unfriendly and too serious to like.
 The squires and knights universally dislike him.
 This is his third attempt to achieve knighthood and he has gotten closer each time.

The song was repeating itself in my head, like a taunt.
 Without thinking, I aimed and shot the nearest dwarf.
 As soon as he went down, the whole camp was facing our direction.
 I was standing up now where everyone could see me.
 There was no point in hiding anymore.
 Emily stayed hidden behind the tree, and I could feel her glare trying to burn me into ashes.
 “You’ll wish you never shot one of his loyal servants.” A dwarf seemed to laugh at me.
 “Kojas will destroy you, half-ling.” “That is it, I’m sick of your riddles!
 Give me a darn straight answer or I’ll shoot every single one of you,” I spat angrily, leveling my bow.
 “Kill all you like half-ling, but that won’t help you in the end.

As his gaze reached the log that lay in front of me, it burst into an orange flame, thin branches forming a spit as he skinned and attached the animals.
 The process was so smooth, I couldn’t say exactly what had happened.
 Chevelle was changing.
 Or, more likely, he was becoming more himself.
 He wasn’t as formal.
 He seemed relaxed, and apparently magic, quick and powerful, was intertwined into his every routine.
 He didn’t need to do much by hand; I would have spent hours trying to build a spit and skin an animal.
 An old question came back to me and I asked, “How do you hunt?” “Hmm?” “You don’t have a bow,” I explained.
 “What do you use to hunt?” He hesitated, as if deciding what to tell me.
 “I use magic, Frey.” He looked like he was waiting for me to be upset.

 I think I presented them with a real interesting case, you know?
 I mean, one of the doctor’s I know, a young guy, a pretty hip cat, he knew my stuff.
 He wanted to talk about the music, nothing but the music.

His face paled, his mouth foamed, and then he died, screaming, still screaming._
 _The vision ended.
 Velixar opened his eyes._
 “What is it that I saw?” he asked.
 “The second time I ever killed,” Qurrah said.
 “I watched that wretched bully succumb to madness from the disease carried by an undead rat.
 He took something I made for my brother, and I made him pay dearly for it.”
 The man in black nodded, going over the memory in his mind.
 “Could be darker, though,” he said.
 “You need not use memories, but they are easier to project.

Another drop landed on my forehead and then on my chin.
 Then they started to pick up speed and I covered my face with my hands.
 The rain streaked through my hair, soaking it to my head.
 Seth looked extremely annoyed as he stood there, his blue hair plastered to his face.
 His eyes were half covered by his hair and his eyes locked onto mine.
 He rolled his eyes and looked away.
 Jason had his arms over his head, trying to keep the rain off his red hair but I already saw dark spots all over it where the rain had escaped his arms.
 Emily's pink hair was dry and safely under a hood.
 Wait, what?
 “Emily, how come you have a hood?” I had to shout over the rain.

“Wow how did you do that?” Emily gasped.
 “I imagined what it was like to fight that creature.
 And then my body took over.” He explained, but I don’t think he even understood.
 Then he was gone again and the real Seth stood up.
 “Try it.” I closed my eyes and thought of school and all of Ms. Stecher’s homework that I needed to do.
 Then my body was doing the rest.
 I felt hot and cold, as the winds seemed to pick up.
 I shivered and opened my eyes.
 I was lying on the ground.
 My hair brown hair flopped in my face as I sat up, seeing Emily dash over to me.

Alan hasn’t.
 Neither have I, probably for many reasons concerning craft, background, personality, genre and such.
 But I still have to wonder if God’s hand might play a role in my lack of whopping success.
 Maybe he knows lots of money would turn me from a rascal into a scoundrel, more self-absorbed than ever.
 I wonder if Brother Lawrence, had he become Pope, would have practiced the presence of God so well.
 He wasn’t even a priest or a monk.
 He was a lay brother.
 A cook in a monastery.
 Even if I can't let go of Zoë, I could more thoroughly rid myself of ambition.
 Maybe I should give up writing.

Aren’t you back?
 Where are you?” “No.” I said frustrated, “Now tell us how you got back.” He closed his eyes and sat down.
 “I imagined myself in my body, and what is was like to be back.
 And then I was back to normal.
 Wait.” The wind picked up around him and then suddenly he was back, blue hair and all, standing beside his sitting, normal body.
 “Wow how did you do that?” Emily gasped.
 “I imagined what it was like to fight that creature.

Wait a minute… How did he get the queen of England’s home phone number?
 And how did he get them to accept a long distance collect call from someone they didn’t even know?
 And how did he do it without being caught and sent over to the Brits for the butt-whupping that he deserved?
 Jim – I think he found the number on the internet.
 As for how he got them to answer, I think he told the servant who answered that the United States was calling to invite the queen to brunch or something.
 I think the Royal family has been inbreeding their servants a little too long.
 As for the rest, I’m sworn to secrecy.
 Liz – But it was all over the news!
 ‘Local mad-man harasses Queen of England over phone’.
 They were searching for weeks!

The beast’s mouth was open, not as if he was going to roar, but simply in relaxed pose.
 He looked like he had been caught stalking forward on the hunt.
 Rodregas stepped up and just stared at him.
 He was beautiful.
 “Don’t touch,” barked Doi’van.
 Rodregas nodded, he knew not to touch, but then realized that his hand was raised and had been reaching out to stroke the lion’s mane.
 He knew that this was the greater sigil that he wanted to gain.
 It was in a perfect circle.
 He had taken in the essence of the Celestial Lion back at Raven Keep, and now Rodregas would consume his own magical power with the greater sigil of a Celestial Lion and become a perfect vessel for its power.
 Rodregas forced himself to step back.

The elf twirled the bow in his hands and then charged.
 Two quick hits batted one of Harruq’s swords out and away.
 A feint, so quick Harruq blocked on instinct, took care of the other.
 His weapons gone, the half-orc was exposed.
 Dieredon wasted no time smashing the half-orc’s groin.
 As he doubled over in pain, a snap kick smacked his chin, splattering blood and forcing him to drop.
 The sharp tip of a blade pressed against Harruq’s throat before he knew what was happening.
 “Move,” Dieredon said.
 “Please, move.
 Give me an excuse to kill you.”

I didn't mean to make you nervous.
 It's just that you continue to surprise me."
 "It's more than a little creepy how you all can do that.
 Are all shape shifters born with the ability to read people's minds?"
 The smile was back, gentle and teasing.
 "Minds no, scents yes.
 The human body is quite marvelous in how many different systems it recruits to match its mood."
 The way Brandon had always known exactly the right thing to say at any given time suddenly made sense.
 Alec let me process his latest little tidbit of information, and then continued.
 "Actually, none of us are born with any unusual abilities.

We wondered why this was happening to us but at the same time we wondered if the same thing was happening in the families across the street.
 Our half-brother, Harry (named after Dino’s father) was soon born.
 Then, my stepfather had even less regard for us as we were now second-class citizens to his “real” son.
 My mother was also abused.
 She stayed, as so many abused women do, because her only options would only lead us back to poverty and uncertainty, and also because Dino threatened to take my little brother to Greece where she would never see him again.
 She protected us and herself as best as she could and she likely hoped for better days.
 Back then we didn’t have options as kids either.
 There were no toll free hotline numbers to call to safely report abuse and we knew better than to tell anyone what was happening behind closed doors.
 If we kept our mouths shut we would hopefully avoid making him even angrier.
 He weighed over 200 pounds and he could do some damage any way he beat us.

Inside he first tested out the plumbing, finding the experience both new and familiar.
 He also had a chance to examine his own plumbing, and was pleased with the results; his new body was large and powerfully built even in places that most people would not see.
 The only thing of use in the water closet was a shaving kit which Rodregas added to the trunk.
 Next he went to the study door only to find it locked.
 He looked for a key but there was nothing.
 He guessed that it was locked by magic and required a magic word or incantation to open the lock.
 He pushed and pulled on the door, but it was solidly made and there was nothing to get a good hold of to test his new strength.
 He looked around for something to use as a pry bar; next to the fireplace was a poker.
 He grabbed it and forced it into the crack were a normal door would have its catch.
 He got it wedged in good but then stopped and went over to the outside door and opening it, listened for anyone nearby before going back inside the room.

Blood ran from where Harruq had broken his nose.
 “Name a price, name it, anything, just name it!”
 Harruq glanced at Qurrah, who only chuckled louder.
 “We have little need for riches, noble.
 All we want is you.”
 The man paled.
 “Me?
 What do you want me for?
 The elves…‌they sent you to attack me, didn’t they?
 Whatever they paid you, I can double it.

And since I suffered and recovered from panic attacks, I feel qualified to offer a remedy.
 Back then, I often read The Daily Word, which frequently repeated the message, “Let go and let God.” What we churchgoing folk might call surrender.
 Surrender is the remedy, at least for panic attacks.
 Maybe for everything.
 As I pass the turnoff to my former home in Chico, I think, surrender must make perfect sense to anyone who adores God like Brother Lawrence did.
 When we are around someone we adore, our defenses cave in, because the only thing we fear, the only thing that needs defending, is the communion with the one we adore.
 If we adore God and live in His presence, we are in constant communion with the eternal, way beyond death.
 So, what’s left to fear.
 The enemy is truly us, in particular the defenses we have established between us and God.
 Vanquish our defensive selves, we are set free.

Besides being an alcoholic his whole life, I found out he was a first rate con-man.
 He was a womanizer, with a taste for young girls, and a big time loser.
 When I did try to let him into our lives, he was verbally abusive to me, my wife and even my children.
 The final disaster with Richard followed a family vacation.
 Richard invited himself to join our annual family beach vacation and I allowed it.
 Richard was to watch the kids, including my two boys and his boy and girl from a subsequent marriage, one night.
 They were all in about the same nine to twelve age range.
 My wife and I wanted to have a dinner alone and Richard didn’t seem to mind.
 When we returned from dinner we discovered that he drove all of the children in his car while he drank Vodka straight from a bottle.
 Once back at the beach house, he was drunk and he verbally abused my children to the point of terror, I was done.

I am a great warrior, but I like to learn new things and I would like to have sufficient magic to be able to learn spells.” Rodregas nodded.
 Doi’van’s response would have surprised him before, but he had learned much of the thoughtful Hellborn in their time together.
 When one looked at him and how powerfully built he was, it was incredible to imagine what he could do on the battlefield with a greater sigil added to his power.
 He would be a true daemon on the battlefield.
 But while Doi’van loved his strength, he also loved his intelligence.
 In comparison, Rodregas was less interested in exploring learning as he was about what he could do as a warrior and carrying out his duty.
 “Well,” Rodregas said, “I don’t think we are going to have any options for sigils for now.
 Let us continue to learn what we can of battle and of magic.
 If we are lucky we can worry about more if we survive our first strike at the Immortalists.” The next morning, during his meditation, Rodregas realized that it was time for action.
 He realized that if they continued simply to hide out in the farmhouse, winter would come and travel would be much more difficult.

Given who she'd spent the last hour being surrounded by, it was no wonder Dominic was worried she was the ugly step sister.
 She needn't have worried.
 Her features were even more exotic than Jasmin's, and Rachel had chosen bright colors that made her stand out much more than usual.
 James' macho cool really was going to finally crack tonight.
 Maybe I could pull the dress off after all.
 Everyone would be so busy looking at the other three girls that they wouldn't even notice me.
 It wasn't ideal, but it was better than nothing.
 A quiet knock brought us all around to find Jessica waiting at the door, her makeup and hair partway done, a dress bag slung over her arm.
 "Can I join you guys?"
 Her voice was scratchy, and her eyes were red from crying, but she was putting on a brave face, and Rachel didn't even hesitate.

 She was lucky everything was back to normal.
 "I believe your taste has changed, darling," Mrs. Tranton said as she watched Marie examine her latest selection in the mirror.
 "Really?
 Perhaps you're right."
 She no longer cared for the stylish clothes that had appealed to her before.
 What she had on now was a simple black dress very much like the one Rick had bought her.

The council leaders were focused on the pendant at my chest, where it lay exposed against my skin in the V of the low cut gown.
 They had ordered the guard to remove it.
 I didn’t understand why they would want my mother’s pendant, but I knew not to ask.
 I knew what happened when you spoke before being instructed.
 The guard stood, facing me, both hands poised to take the leather chain over my head as I stared on insensibly.
 His touch lingered and I glanced down, surprised to see he had a firm grip on the necklace but wasn’t lifting it, couldn’t lift it.
 I looked to the council leaders as the guard turned toward the table and decisively stepped away from me.
 “The crystal will not be removed,” he said.
 Though he spoke only to the elders, it set into motion behind us a wave of murmurs that filled the room, reverberating up the high ceiling.
 A council elder silenced the witnesses and then trained on me.

The collective progress of humankind will achieve its maximum velocity when we have discovered how to consciously accelerate the process of values acquisition.
 The role of the UNESCO Commission on Culture and Development can make a valuable contribution to our understanding of this most important issue.
 Strategies for Developing Human Resourcefulness
 The following strategies can be carried out by both govern mental and non-governmental agencies at the national and international level to achieve the goals set forth in this report:
 International level
 1.Shift resources from defence to human resource development: Worldwide, massive investment is needed to improve the quantity and quality of education and training.
 A substantial portion of these resources will have to come from reduced military spending.
 But as recent experience illustrates, savings in defence spending will not automatically go to this sector.
 The UN Social Summit should adopt specific goals for reducing military expenditure worldwide and channelling a specific percentage of the savings into education, vocational training, public information and other programmes for development of human resources.
 Each country should set similar goals.

 Jim – I’ve missed you.

 Jim – I’ve been busy, classes are a bit tougher this year.
 Liz – Finally going to graduate, you sure took your sweet time.
 Jim – I was enjoying myself, besides when in life would I ever get the chance to take a class about the history of early Mayan painting and sculpture.
 Liz – You actually took that class?

“Hadn’t pissed yet,” Harruq shouted to his brother.
 “You could be a bit kinder, you know.”
 “At least you’re awake,” Qurrah said back.
 “Now get to the castle.
 I may not approve, and I still don’t trust them, but for once we might have something worthwhile to eat.
 I won’t let a simple thing like sleep keep us from it.”

 Months later, Harruq awoke at the dawn, jerking upward and uttering a sharp gasp.

“By my mortal blood and sweat and tears do I swear my fealty to the Squire Rodregas in the name of the Father of Ocean, Sky and Earth.” Rodregas nodded and responded as was required, “As the All-Father protects and guards his people so do I swear to do my best to live up to your oath in the Name of the All-Father.” Rodregas reached down and picked up the sword across Doi’van’s arms and lifted it up.
 “As I lift your sword up, so do I lift up your honor and make it mine.” As he finished the oath he handed the sword back to Doi’van, who responded with the final, “My arm shall be your arm, my sword your sword, my honor your honor.” Rodregas had expected to have to claim his followers as Oath Bond, but a knight would never have demanded to see the oath.
 He felt guilt seize his stomach at having been mistaken and knowing Doi’van had been forced to swear the oath, due to not wanting to blow their cover.
 Rodregas swore to himself that he would lift the oath as soon as they could be free, but the fact that Doi’van had trusted him enough to say such an oath out loud, which could put his very soul in jeopardy, was a powerful statement to their growing friendship.
 Rodregas looked back at the sorcerer who actually seemed surprised at watching the oath sworn, “Satisfied, Sir?” The sorcerer waved his hand and without a word went back to his chair sitting down as a king to his throne.
 The Knight Captain called for a squire, who he commanded to find them a room.
 Rodregas sensed that the Knight Captain was not happy with what had happened, but he said no word of apology.
 As the three were led away, Rodregas asked the boy the name of the sorcerer at the table.
 “That is the Immortalist Van’dret, Ambassador to the Knights from the Guild.
 He is very powerful you know.

He had no desire to hurt them, and less to be killed by them; but was unsure of how they could share the farm with them.
 Like the barn, the house was made of perfect cut stone that looked almost new; everything else had gone back to nature.
 Rodregas circled around to the back where the stone steps led to the cellar.
 He was sure that originally that there had had doors covering the entrance, but of course, they were long gone.
 Rodregas smelled what he would find well before he came around the corner.
 Next to the entrance was the corpse of a large bear which had recently been killed and partly eaten.
 It had been a magnificent creature, the largest of the local black bears that he had ever seen.
 Rodregas realized that it had been a Dire beast, drawn here by the safe magical energies.
 Next to the dead bear were the two Dire Cats.
 Rodregas had gone around the corner thinking they were in the cellar, but instead found himself no more than twenty feet from them.

“Many years.
 Fifteen.
 Twenty.”
 “Why did you sleep with her?” Qurrah asked.
 “She filled me with drink and then tricked me,” the elven spirit said.
 “Never would I willingly have touched one of Celestia’s cursed.”
 Qurrah shook his head.
 “Answer me truthfully, you wretched spirit.

He didn’t reply and I suddenly didn’t want him to.
 We settled onto the floor of the small den, our backs against the wall, the rock overhang blocking the light of the moon.
 “That is my flame,” Chevelle said, “try to extinguish it.” And my training began.
 Chapter Nine Ruby
 Early the next morning, even before first light, Chevelle woke me for training.
 Gone were the games we had played.
 These lessons were intense and stressful.
 I’d been unable to generate magic on demand so he’d started lunging at me with weapons, sticks, fire, forcing me to respond to protect myself.
 After each attack, he would come right back at me and if I tried to repeat a tactic for defense, he would overpower my magic and push me to find a new maneuver.
 I was beat, winded, drained.

He went to get the TV guide and found the listing for Saturday evening.
 A western had come on at 9:00.
 That would be a good place to begin, since it was set before 1927.
 "I think you'll like this western," he told her, turning on the TV with the remote.
 She stared at the little box in his hand.
 "Did that box make the picture appear?"
 "Yeah."
 "How?"
 He shrugged.
 "I don't--" "Know."

His brother was his only friend.
 Velixar was his master.
 Solid ground.
 Qurrah slipped over to the window and glanced out.
 The sun hung low, its top edge barely visible above the rooftops.
 He had hoped the streets would be empty, but instead he saw a patrol of elves turn the corner, their swords drawn.
 He stepped back and hid as they passed by.
 The half-orc chewed on his fingers.
 Harruq had abandoned him, true, but perhaps he remained nearby, waiting for him.
 Then there was Velixar, no doubt furious at the elves’ victory.

Simple commercial systems need to be created to support commerce and industry as well – even such basic systems as telephone listings of sources of products and services that are found in every telephone directory in the West.
 If trade is to develop between private enter prises, credit checking agencies and collection agencies need to be established.
 For enterprises which do not qualify or cannot compete for limited bank resources, financial institutions offering hire purchase or leasing of industrial and consumer goods are necessary.
 The market reforms were expected to lead to a rapid proliferation of new small enterprises, but most of those created so far are engaged only in trading and retail sales.
 Small business development centres, business incubators, industrial estates, and venture capital funds are needed to encourage entrepreneur ship.
 Some large industrial enterprises have begun leasing portions of their space and equipment to groups of employees who form small businesses for production of equipment and components.
 This practice should be encouraged and popularized as a natural step towards privatization.
 9.Information is a stimulant and fuel for transition: The shortage of reliable in formation and of institutions to disseminate it are major constraints on the development of the market.
 In a command economy, a few people at the top receive most of the information and take most of the decisions, while the rest of the population carries them out.
 In contrast, the market is based on millions of decisions taken every day by millions of individuals in fields, factories and retail stores around the country.

You read Castaneda?
 Anyway, there standing in my way, like fucking Lot’s wife, was this raven-haired beauty, and I had this strange idea, man, that we had conjured her, that the music had brought her into being.
 You can’t understand.
 Or maybe you can.
 You know Memphis.
 I really felt like here was a woman made of soul and blood and electricity and philharmonic, eldritch diablerie, you know?
 I thought she was fucking Terpsichore, man.
 And she was so beautiful—she IS so beautiful—that I was stopped like a clock.
 I was a man hit in the heart with a sledgehammer.
 She just reached out and took my hand.

It is safe.
 They will not attack again so soon.” “When?” I could hear the worry in my tone, despite his assurance.
 “We will protect you, Frey.” Sure.
 I might have rolled my eyes.
 “We knew they were following before.
 Our mistake was in assuming they meant a physical attack.
 We will not allow them so close again.” “So they’re still following?” Panic.
 “No.
 Not now.” He paused.
 “They have accomplished what they came for.

The spirit gave Qurrah one last glare then dissipated into the fading light.
 Silence filled the room.
 “Well, what did you think?” asked Harruq.
 “I think,” Qurrah said, “that was enjoyable.”
 The two paused, each thinking the same thing.
 Finally, Harruq voiced his thoughts.
 “You think Velixar knew it when he sent us to kill him?”
 Qurrah stretched, letting out a small sigh as his back popped.
 “Yes, I do,” he said.
 “Although I don’t know why.

I was wrong on both accounts.
 The company, as Donovan had dubbed it, also included Dominic and Jasmin.
 Dominic had smiled shyly in my direction as we'd climbed into an ostentatious black Mercedes.
 Jasmin just looked like she'd rather be anywhere than on babysitting duty.
 Rachel had explained that Alec didn't want us delicate, fragile girls traveling alone, so he'd assigned us bodyguards, who happened to also be female and delicate-looking, but who weren't nearly as fragile.
 Also, it turned out we weren't going to Sanctuary, or St. George, or even anywhere in Utah, a fact I didn't realize until we'd been on the road for twenty minutes.
 "Oh, Adri, don't be silly.
 You can't do real shopping in Sanctuary.
 Besides, Alec wouldn't have let the four of us go alone if we'd been planning on staying so close to Brandon's territory.
 Vegas was definitely the best option given the time restrictions we're under."

My mind was still a little fuzzy, but it was working well enough for me to know he was wrong.
 "No.
 She's not going to be home until Sunday.
 There isn't any reason to go back there yet."
 I looked around for Rachel, but she'd disappeared sometime between when I'd started falling, and when I'd thought to thank her.
 "You mean she wasn't planning on coming back until Sunday.
 Once Brandon gets involved in things, they tend not to go as expected."
 I wanted to ask questions, but Rachel appeared from a hallway.
 "He's right, Adriana.
 You need to be home in case your mom returns sooner than expected.

Harruq chuckled.
 “He was wrong, obviously.
 Qurrah was stuck talking like that.
 Like a snake hiss or a raspy whisper.”
 “Or a dying man,” Aurelia whispered, so soft that Harruq could not make out her words.
 !
 [section break](break.png)
 The streets were all the same to him, so down them all he wandered.
 The image of Aurelia and Harruq danced in his mind, and conflicting feelings rippled through his chest.
 “She seems a kind enough elf,” Qurrah said, talking to himself since he had no company.

I tried to thrash around enough for him to put me down, but he restrained my arms with a couple of fingers.
 The motion was so casual I was pretty sure nobody even realized he'd pinned my arms to my stomach with surprising strength.
 I thought about kicking, or even screaming, but that would just leave me feeling like a child and give Alec exactly the kind of attention he was probably hoping for.
 "You hit your head pretty hard; I really think we should get you to the office.
 Sir, with your permission?"
 The comment about hitting my head settled me down.
 It wasn't until we were out in the hall that I realized my head didn't hurt.
 That was probably a really bad sign.
 "Let go of my hands."
 Alec unpinned my arms, set me down, and then chuckled as I started gingerly probing my scalp.

And the instruments sounded like giant bells, big as mountains, far away.” Eric had sat up.
 His eyes bored into mine.
 “Were you scared?
 What’s it feel like there?” “You know when you’re away from home and no matter how great a time you’re having, you’re still a bit uneasy, so when you get home you always feel relieved?
 You unwind, your heart slows.
 Nothing can hurt you now.
 That’s how it felt.” “You’re a lucky guy,” Eric said, in a more wistful tone than I had ever heard him use.

 Driving through Los Angeles, thinking is dangerous.

Two nervous days passed before I got the go-ahead and a time and location for the drug deal.
 I was instructed to call Ashley and tell her the time but not to commit to the location.
 The police wanted the time to set up the area of the bust location and they did not want the drug dealer to come early and perhaps see them preparing.
 I was instructed to meet the police over an hour before the scheduled time.
 During this entire time since Brandon was busted, my wife and I had been working to detox him.
 We had him on complete lockdown at the house with no visitors allowed.
 His room and the entire house were still searched daily, including the CD cases and every nook and cranny.
 We used the professional drug tests and we tested him randomly.
 Hopefully he hadn’t found a way to get this drug into our home (again).
 He finished the worst of the drug withdrawals a couple of days after the disastrous intervention.

The political necessity of maintaining popular support and the threat of exposure by the media force elected governments to take all necessary steps to ensure sufficient food supplies.
 Modern democracy is the political counterpart of the market economic system.
 Historically, democracy broke the monopoly of the aristocracy over governance of the people, giving freedom and rights to the individual politically.
 The market system – basing itself on property rights and self-determined initiatives of the individual producer and consumer – is an economic expression of the same principle.
 Both democracy and market-oriented economies decentralize authority and decision making, providing the essential legal and regulatory framework and empowering the individual to choose and act with minimum direction or interference from above.
 Both depend for their success on the quality of those choices, which means on the quality of education and information possessed by the mass of people, and on the freedom and dynamism of the population.
 In contrast, authoritarian systems and command economies centralize decision making, restrict the flow of information to the public, foster vast unresponsive bureaucracies, limit individual freedom and initiative within narrow bounds, and encourage obedience and conformity rather than innovation.
 The spread of education, which fosters independent thinking, and dissemination of information through the media were important factors in undermining public acceptance of communism in Eastern Europe.
 In a real sense, it was Gorbachev’s policy of glasnost that brought down the Iron Curtain.
 It opened up an insular society and exposed it to an avalanche of new information, new ideas and new possibilities, which released a fervent aspiration in the people for a better life.

And because he always put what was best for me before what he wanted.
 We would kiss and kiss and kiss, and then he'd stop and tell me we had to stop, or we'd end up making love.
 And I was never the one to stop, Mother.
 The more passionate the kisses became, the more I wanted.
 I-I really didn't understand until my last evening with him that we couldn't just kiss forever, that eventually kisses wouldn't be enough.
 If he hadn't stopped, we would have gone on and on and on until--"  She caught her breath, biting her lip and fixing her eyes on the handkerchief she was clenching.
 Mrs. Tranton leaned forward, putting a hand on her daughter's knee.
 "I understand."
 Marie glanced up.
 "I love him, Mother."

“Come on, Qurrah.
 I’m getting hungry,” Harruq said as he trudged off, his hands at his sides grabbing the air where his swords no longer were.
 !
 [section break](break.png)
 The two brothers lived in the poorest part of town, sheltered in an old building long abandoned.
 When they had first arrived, several homeless men claimed it as their own.
 Harruq had slit their throats when they slept and then Qurrah worked his art.
 The few vagabonds left in the city quickly learned to avoid the worn building marked by holes in its roof and long shadows that lingered no matter where the sun shone.
 Harruq shoved open the door and then halted as he breathed in the stuffy air.
 “Nothing like home, eh?” he said.

 He threaded his fingers into her hair, nuzzling her temple.
 "L-lose me?"
 she breathed.
 He raised his head to look at her.
 "Don't you know how I feel about you, sweetheart?
 Why I took you to Hollywood?
 Why I want to make your dreams come true?
 I love you, Marie."
 Marie's breath caught in her throat.

His scent was divine, full of subtle themes I wasn't experienced enough to pick out, all of which screamed of warm power and rock-like masculinity.
 For half a second the torrent of sensation was too strong to leave room for conscious thought.
 I realized I'd closed my eyes to better savor the experience.
 When I opened them Alec's expression had moved from annoyance to sadness.
 I had a pair of heartbeats to wonder at the strange tricks my subconscious was playing on me, and then the dream started fading away.
 The heavenly surroundings were predictably the first thing to disappear, leaving afterimages of light burned into the corners of my vision.
 Alec was the next thing to go, but the memory of his features clung to my mind long after I found myself in a featureless void.
 Stranger still, his scent stayed with me even longer.
 I was just self-aware enough to hope I'd remember it all when I awoke in the morning.
 Chapter 5 It was a good thing I'd started school in the middle of the week.

Asking Captain Poir to send up Adapt Korin had been totally unplanned.
 He had been dreaming of killing Korin for all the 18 years that he had served in the tower.
 The Sorcerer Ravenhurr had been an immoral monster that used those around him for his own selfish desires.
 But Adapt Korin was of a more casual evil; he never passed up the opportunity to hurt those around him, physically or emotionally.
 Ravenhurr had existed in the same body for the full eighteen years of Rodregas’ service, and was hundreds of years old.
 In all his years serving in the tower Ravenhurr had only tried to hold the ceremony three times, each time abandoning the attempt due to the lack of a celestial animal.
 A celestial animal was extremely rare, but required as part of the ceremony for Ravenhurr’s next step up in power.
 In contrast, his assistant, the Adapt Korin, had been going though bodies constantly.
 Worse, he seemed to take great delight in letting people know what fate awaited them.
 Rape and torture of the victims were common occurrences with Korin.

But she wanted to go back to 1927.
 So there was absolutely no point in falling in love with her.
 Marie found herself thinking about Rick all the time that week.
 He was always smiling, always kind and gentle.
 He showed her new things he thought she'd like and took her places and bought her gifts.
 But what she enjoyed most was just being with him.
 He made her feel special.
 And he was protective without making her feel confined.
 He called her every day at lunch and sometimes later in the afternoon.
 Last week he'd been concerned about her, worried about how she was getting along in a strange place.

To Marie's amazement, after her father had bathed, shaved, and dressed, he rejoined them in the living room with a cup of coffee.
 "Aren't you going to the office, Father?"
 "The day I get my daughter back?

 John stood then.
 "May I assume then that it's permissible for me to take the day off, Father?"
 Marie stared at her brother.
 "You've joined Father's company?"
 "Yes.

I felt my insides clench and knot, but this time it was happiness that brought tears to my eyes.
 My wavering vision was just up to making out the outline of Rachel's present where I'd left it on the table.
 Feeling incredibly ungrateful and thoughtless, I limped over to the table and tore open the delicate wrapping paper.
 It was a copy of the latest Les Misérables movie, complete with the score from the most recent Broadway production, and a signed picture of the entire cast.
 Mom still wasn't home by the time it got dark, but I went to bed truly happy for the first time in ages.
 Rachel was the best friend a girl could wish for, and Brandon had come through in spades.
 Chapter 18 I felt my stomach do handsprings as I walked inside the opera house.
 The week had flown by much faster than expected.
 Especially considering how slowly each individual day had dragged along.
 Most of my waking hours had been spent wondering if Saturday night was ever going to arrive.

You, me, most of the rest of the school, we survive by staying neutral.
 For better or worse, we aren't attractive, cool, or rich enough to get in with Alec or Brandon.
 Once you piss one of them off though, you'd better hope you're in with the other one, because that's the only way you've got any kind of protection."
 It was starting to sound like organized crime or something.
 Of course they could make my life miserable socially, but it wasn't like they were going to really hurt me.
 I opened my mouth to try and calm Britney down, but she cut me off.
 "You don't understand how much influence they have.
 Three years ago someone tried to start a newspaper in Sanctuary.
 Things were going along just fine until he pissed off Alec's mother.
 The city condemned the building and refused to change the zoning laws so he could get another place.

Biology?
 Character?
 It’s inexplicable, really.
 All of my roommates had dropped out of high school but somehow I continued; although my grades sucked, they were passing grades.
 In my senior year I only took classes until noon because that is all I needed to graduate.
 I got another job at a local restaurant for the lunch shift as well as any days I was off from the grocery store.
 I realized at an early age that nobody was going to give me anything and if I wanted something I would need to earn it.
 If I didn’t succeed, I wouldn’t survive!
 Somewhere around this time, I decided to try and find my biological father, Richard, a natural thing for a young man my age to want to do, right?
 So I tracked him down and called him.

I would have to ask.
 The dust must have given me courage.
 “It talked about exchange.” Still nothing.
 “About energy… life… for magic.” He cleared his throat.
 “Yes.” “Can you tell me about it?” “Today, after Anvil sparred with Steed, you saw how the strike drained him.
 This is something you’ll need to know for a group conflict.
 The tactics are different than one on one.” He hadn’t answered my question at all.
 But he was talking and I would take it.
 I nodded for him to go on.
 “A single opponent allows you to use more energy, focus only on that and let yourself…” My thoughts were wandering.

His great helm had a purple feather sticking out the top and he had a short, matching cape coming out the back.
 Rodregas decided that he would go after Nordien first.
 He would make sure the favorite of Ambassador Van’dret would not win if nothing else.
 If Geriodon became a knight at least an honorable man had the day.
 Several of the squires were being seen to by attendants making sure everything was secure, and waiting for the start of the match.
 Rodregas thought he was alone until he heard Imeralda speak from behind him, “Did you see who is watching from the Great Hall’s door?” she asked.
 Rodregas glanced over, it was Van’dret.
 He stood tall and handsome, young squires surrounding him ready to serve.
 Rodregas thought that the Immortalist was watching him.
 He would have to leave quickly after the tournament, as the man was growing suspicious of them.

For instance, increasing trade with East Asia and with low-wage developing countries is cited as a major cause of the fall in the wages of unskilled workers in the United States.
 As in the case of technology, there is evidence that free trade destroys jobs in some industries, especially unskilled or low-skilled jobs in high-wage economies.
 In some instances the devastating impact of increasing imports may justify a gradual approach to removing trade barriers.
 However, the overall impact of manufactured exports from developing countries has been vastly exaggerated.
 Exports by the Newly Industrializing Economies to the United States have risen from 1.1 to 2.1 per cent of US GNP over the past decade.
 America’s share of trade with low-wage countries represents only 3 per cent of GDP, compared to 2 per cent in 1960.
 For the OECD as a whole, imports from low-wage countries represent only 1.5 per cent of total expenditure on goods and services.
 On the other hand, there is irrefutable evidence that expanding international trade creates large numbers of jobs, even in high-wage economies.
 The real issue, therefore, is whether the overall balance favours net job creation or net job destruction for each nation and for the global economy.
 On this issue the evidence is clear.

After Rick had left for work, Marie walked on the treadmill for nearly 45 minutes and then made herself a cup of tea.
 Rested, she opened the box containing the exercise movie Rick had gotten her and with delight put it into the BCR.
 No--VCR, she corrected herself.
 She got so involved in the exercises and then exploring the house that she'd only watched one of the movies--"Gone with the Wind," which made her laugh sometimes and cry sometimes and held her spellbound the entire time--by 5:30, when Rick got home from work.
 “Would you like me to get you some more movies for tomorrow?” Rick asked Marie as they prepared dinner together.
 “I still have that other one to watch.
 ‘Casablanca.’”  She handed him the green peppers she’d just chopped.
 “What next?” “Mushrooms.”  He handed her a carton.
 Rick added some seasonings to the sauce he was stirring.
 Glancing at Marie, he saw that she had a mushroom on the cutting board but was just staring at it.

Rodregas looked for Doi’van and Imeralda and he was sad to see that they had not been there to share his moment.
 Van’dret at least had left.
 The next few hours went by quickly.
 He was introduced to many people.
 It was late as the other knights went to find sleep when both Doi’van and Imeralda suddenly both appeared.
 He could see from their body language that they were ready to do more than congratulate him.
 CHAPTER 15 DARK SHADOWS
 Doi’van led the three deeper into the great cathedral and said, “Sir Rodregas, congratulations are in order for becoming a Knight of the Soaring Heavens, but I fear Van’dret is getting suspicious.
 You now have the right to enter the Chamber that holds the greater sigils.
 I think you need to go there now.” Rodregas nodded.

"Not for a decent young woman.
 Where's your mother?"
 "At a committee meeting."
 She actually would rather go shopping with her mother than alone.
 Her mother had wonderful taste but still never tried to talk her out of some of the more outlandish items she wanted to try.
 They always had a good time together, and Marie had been disappointed to find her mother gone when she awoke.
 "Call Tom then," Mr. Tranton suggested.
 "He's playing golf.
 Really, Father, I'll be fine.
 There's nothing-" "Why don't I take you?"

I was bored again, with everyone entertaining themselves, so I leaned back against a rock and pulled my pack to my lap.
 I wrapped my cloak loosely around me and positioned my legs so I could place the book there and, hopefully, not be found out.
 I wondered how many more days of traveling we’d have.
 I didn’t see a peak—didn’t even know if we were going to the peak of the mountain we were on—but I was too cowardly to ask, to think about what had happened, so I distracted myself in the journal.
 My sister hasn’t spoken to me since our mother passed.
 I wish she was… different.
 Not merely a different personality, but different altogether.
 I can remember the stories in my mother’s journal about her own sister.
 They were so close.
 That was, of course, until my father.

I shook my head, as confused by his reaction, by how close he'd come to losing control, as I was by my not having felt threatened.
 "No, I want to stay, but how can I knowing it will mean you're going to be fighting to the death?"
 Alec tossed the branch away with a sigh.
 "I've spent years learning control, but sometimes I still forget just how breakable everything around me is.
 If you go back to Brandon, you support his claim that you belong to him, and I'd still be forced to challenge him.
 If I didn't, he would be justified in killing whichever two of my friends he wants."
 "So there's no way you can avoid fighting him?"
 Alec's smile was more bittersweet than normal.
 "No, but it's not too late to save you.
 I can have you on a flight to Paris tonight.

He struck again and I pulled the sword back, twisting to block another shot.
 I straightened and raised it back, surprised at how powerful I felt the moment before releasing my blow.
 I smiled as I swung at him, sure he would stop me but reveling in being attacker instead of victim.
 He wound his blade around mine, a metallic screech filling my ears as he knocked my strike aside before coming back at me.
 We continued, blow after blow, the repetitive clank forming a pattern in my head.
 Chevelle seemed to be enjoying himself as the exercise increased in intensity.
 I found I was as well.
 I’d taken no direct beatings like my other training and I wasn’t getting as tired.
 No magic.
 I could see why they used weapons.

No wife, no children.” “You are expected to have a wife and child after just two decades of life?” He laughed for some reason I could not see.
 “Then you have no family of your own?” “I am not expected to pair for quite some time, if ever.
 And children?
 Ha!” He was visibly perplexed so I kept talking.
 “I have a family as well, though my mother died recently.” Sadness washed his features.
 “I’m sorry.
 Was it an imp?” “No.” I laughed at the strange idea.
 And for no apparent reason, I told him the truth.
 “She died of sorrow.” His brow furrowed.
 We shared the boar and talked further, casually, as if we were old friends.

It was like keeping so many secrets for her brother had made her especially sensitive to other people's secrets.
 Another few steps brought us to the door, and I held it open for Rachel to follow me outside.
 The intense heat felt like a physical blow.
 I could almost feel my pores open up in an effort to keep me from overheating.
 The sensory overload as my eyes tried to adjust to the unfiltered afternoon sun momentarily distracted me.
 It wasn't until I heard the other door swing shut that I realized James had followed us through, but he'd taken the door on the right instead of the one of the left that I'd been holding open for him.
 Wow, talk about a chauvinistic pig.
 It wasn't worth getting bent out of shape.
 I let my door swing shut, and walked over to Rachel's side so that I could see the entire parking lot.
 Empty as it was, it didn't take very long to realize Britney's little white Saturn was gone.

I almost choked when warm wine hit my throat.
 He leaned forward to get a better look at me as I lowered the container.
 He looked as if he thought I might spook, otherwise I guessed he had plenty to say hidden beneath that smirk.
 It didn’t stop him from moving uncomfortably close, though, or eyeing me with what I was certain was the same look I’d just given my meal.
 I cleared my throat, thinking I’d made my sense of discomfort clear when he started to move, but he only stood, which brought him even closer.
 Well, parts of him.
 I turned toward the fire, tugging the pack tight against my shoulder as I prepared for a graceful exit.
 For departure from food and warmth.
 I jumped a little when the first tree uprooted across the clearing.
 It was only a sapling, but the second and third tree followed.

Marie would be embarrassed if she thought Teri and Jeremy had seen them kissing.
 "Mmm."
 She kissed him again.
 Rick returned her kiss and then gently disengaged her arms.
 "It's getting late.
 We need to get home."
 He helped her into the car.
 "I think I like 1927 cars better than 2011 cars," Marie said as Rick slid behind the wheel.
 "Why?"
 "I could sit right beside you in a 1927 car."

Alec of course spent the whole class unearthing other little bits of embarrassing information.
 I'd never experienced anything like it, every question I answered spawned two more, and he invariably seemed to figure out the underlying reasons I'd done a given thing, or reacted a certain way.
 I'd just finished describing my failed tryout for the school's production of To Kill a Mockingbird, when he hit me with a completely unexpected question.
 "So tell me about both your best date and your worst date before you came here."
 I felt my skin instantly heat up, and looked down, unable to meet his gaze.
 He let me sit there for a couple of seconds, and then reached out and used one gentle finger to nudge my chin up.
 "What's the matter, afraid I'll be jealous?"
 I shook my head, fighting the urge to look back down.
 "No, there isn't anything to be jealous of.
 I'd never been on a single date before Sanctuary, and you know all about what's happened since I arrived."

I'd explain the unexplainable later.
 “Aim for the neck!” I shouted to the both of them.
 “It's their weak point.” They both nodded in agreement.
 Jason spun around and began to stab them as I suggested.
 He ducked and I say their number start to drop because of his quick reflexes.
 The swarm's size was reduced to half.
 The syphons were starting to look uneasy, hesitating before they flung themselves at us.
 It didn't matter to me.
 “Retreat!” one of the voices yelled.
 “Fall back!” They gave one more angry hiss at us and disappeared into the woods.

I forced a chuckle.
 "Please, Mom.
 Where else would I be?
 Saturdays are one of my only two chances all week to actually sleep in.
 It isn't like I'm going to climb out of bed at the crack of dawn and go hiking or something."
 Mom's chuckle was almost genuine.
 If Alec hadn't implied she was going to suspect I'd been up to no good, I probably wouldn't have even noticed how off she sounded.
 "You're right, dear.
 I shouldn't have doubted you.
 I just had a few kids come hiking past this morning talking about this massive party the entire school was at last night.

 So what are you two talking about?

 At least as far as I know.
 I guess there isn’t much else to talk about.
 (To Jim) So you know that Art isn’t allowed to adopt him.

He hates the bootlegs, for good reason.
 If he’d wanted The Basement stuff out there, you know.
 But, I did get involved.
 At least it gives Pete something to do.
 There’s nothing more dangerous than a lawyer with time on his hands.
 Lessee, the other two cuts, are “Laurie Had Thighs Like Opinici” and “Melody Came as a Lichtenstein Painting.”  Two originals that I’ve never used.
 “Laurie” is a blues—a beat I stole from Fred McDowell—that almost makes it.
 The lyrics didn’t gel, I don’t think.
 Written from pain, written in dread—so, well, it ain’t exactly art.
 “Melody” is something altogether different.

I worked my jaw, tugged at the lobe of my ear.
 The stranger’s lips moved, apparently able to speak again, and Anvil approached him, dwarfing the captive with his mass.
 Anvil exhibited remarkable menace when he addressed the frozen councilman, who mouthed another reply.
 Through ringing ears I couldn’t decipher their words, but somehow I did hear the breaking bones.
 A grotesque crunch accompanied the snapping of the councilman’s thigh, and he dropped nearly to the ground.
 Anvil leaned over him, somehow even more intimidating as he spoke directly to the man, as if they were the only two here, as if he hadn’t just suffered a traumatic injury.
 And, evidently, Anvil didn’t like the answers he received, because the councilman’s other leg snapped, dropping him to rest on the stumps of his broken, mangled thighs.
 I should have turned at the sight, but I couldn’t keep from wondering how it was possible he remained upright at all.
 Anvil bent down to keep his stare close, threatening, and the broken man looked at me.
 His glare turned accusing, his mouth suddenly moving with heated, determined words, but my ears only rang louder, engulfing all other sound.

No naughtiness.” And then, under her breath, “On my part.” “No qualifications, Ruby.” “Just teasing.
 Now go, we have stuff to do.” My stomach knotted.
 Stuff.
 Chevelle appeared reluctant to get up.
 For a moment, I thought he might reach out to me, but he only stood and left without another word.
 It ached.
 I didn’t want him to hate me.
 Ruby whirled into the room and grabbed me around the waist from behind, spinning me up, over the back of the seat, and through her door before I could process what was happening.
 She plopped me down in the center of her bed and swung around to sit in front of me.
 My head was reeling from the spin as she smiled at me, waving her hands and bringing a plethora of bottles and canisters flying toward us to drop on the bed.

He fired two arrows, one for each eye.
 They shattered into fire, and finally blood did flow.
 It ran down the dead flesh and bone that was his face, over his black robes, and pooled in the grass below.
 He fell prone, still screaming his anger and fury.
 For five hundred years he had walked the land of Dezrel.
 All that time, all those killings, and this was how he would fail.
 “Karak!” he shouted, all his power fleeing him.
 His undead minions collapsed, their souls released.
 The gates to the abyss opened before his eyes, and he felt the pull on his soul.
 The dark fire already burned.

My mother had tried to warn me, but I wanted and needed to know for myself.
 My mom’s warnings could not deter me as I was a teenager and we all know teenagers are smarter than everyone else.
 I have a theory about teenagers; basically they could be walking off a cliff towards a canyon and you could yell and scream warnings all you want but your time would be better spent packing them a lunch so they could eat it on the way down.
 Numerous attempts to let Richard in our lives always ended in disaster.
 I know it is natural to want to know who your father is.
 Unfortunately sometimes he is a complete jerk.
 Richard is just not a good person; actually he is quite the opposite.
 It was difficult for me to discover that my father’s lifelong friends didn’t even know he had sons.
 Besides being an alcoholic his whole life, I found out he was a first rate con-man.
 He was a womanizer, with a taste for young girls, and a big time loser.

"I'm not washing my car again."
 I expected Rachel to back down as soon as she realized he was spoiling for a fight, but if anything she looked more determined.
 It was hard to believe this was the same person I'd had to rescue from Cassie so recently.
 I stopped Rachel just before she could put the impressive lungful of air she'd just taken in to whatever use she'd planned.
 "It's okay.
 I'm better.
 The lane's dusty and exercise would do me good."
 She hesitated, obviously torn, but my fumbling fingers finally found the unfamiliar door release and I made the decision for her.
 I swung the door open and slipped out of the car before she could respond.
 I waved goodbye with a cheery casualness I thought did a pretty good job of hiding my desire to break into tears.

"I can't sleep.
 I've been trying, but I'm too wound up to do anything but just lie there.
 I thought I'd come downstairs and talk to you instead.
 I mean, unless it's bothering you.
 You know, keeping you from patrolling or something."
 That last bit hadn't really been planned.
 I'd wanted to come downstairs and talk to him, but wouldn't have dreamt of just saying it outright.
 Maybe it was the natural high I got simply from being around him.
 Alec's smile was brief, but it felt like the first one I'd seen since he'd been forced to save me.
 I couldn't blame him for being worried about how this was going to further strain already tense relations with Brandon's pack.

Obviously you couldn't spend your whole afternoon tutoring, as that would negatively affect your efforts to catch up.
 I'm thinking just an hour or so per night.
 It would just be minimum wage, but I think you'll find you quite enjoy teaching."
 Still at a loss for words, I just nodded.
 I started towards the door as soon as I was dismissed, but stopped at the threshold.
 "Is everything okay Mrs. Campbell?
 I mean it seemed like you were really worried when you left."
 I trailed off, worried by the measuring look that she gave me.
 "I don't suppose you're one of the gossipers, and I guess it wouldn't really matter if you were.
 I got a call that my daughter had been in a car accident.

Eugene – Yeah, I guess.
 Jim – Besides, Art said you had promised to give all that troublemaking up anyhow.
 Eugene – I know.
 Jim – You’re not going to break your promise are you?
 Eugene – No.
 Liz – Then why so gloomy?
 Eugene – For once I would have liked something to go my way.
 Then at least I wouldn’t have gotten teased about it when I told you the story.
 I wanted to scare these people, and I failed.
 Once again I’ve returned as Eugene the failure.

When they saw us appear, both dropped their weapons and smiled at us.
 Typical cover up.
 “Hey Seth, it looks like Jazell didn’t kill you after all,” Emily said and flashed me a grin.
 “What was that all about anyway, Jazell?” I opened my mouth to spill the whole truth when Seth glanced at me.
 I sighed at his expression, knowing that I couldn’t tell anyone if Seth didn’t want me to.
 I didn’t want to make it worse by revealing what I knew.
 When I didn’t reply, she covered her mouth with her hand to try to cover her chuckles.
 “Oh then,” she giggled, “I hope you two had a nice chat.” “Stop it Emily!” I snapped and felt my face burn.
 She snickered.
 “Okay whatever you say, Jazell.” “We have to tell you guys something,” I told her and Jason about how the dwarf had showed up and what he said about Igneeria.

she asked, turning slowly in front of him.
 "Very nice."
 "But do you really like it?
 I don't have anything this color, but I like it."
 It was called blue lotus and was the predominant color in an Egyptian motif.
 She and her mother had attended a fashion show two weeks ago, and she'd loved the Egyptian patterns on the mannequins who'd modeled them.
 But the mannequins were thin women, and although she was slender, she had too many curves to be fashionable.
 Binding her breasts helped a little, but it was hard to hide her hips and derriere.
 And she was rather petite, which didn’t help matters.
 Davis smiled at her in the ugly, shapeless dress.

It was entirely my fault.
 I shouldn't have tried to squeeze past you like that."
 The smile was still there.
 That had to be a good sign.
 Usually when people said something nice and didn't mean it their smiles only lasted as long as they were speaking.
 I tried a tentative smile in return and his widened slightly.
 "I'm Brandon."
 Feeling more than a little nervous, I allowed him to capture my right hand in his.
 "I'm Adr...Adriana."
 Our handshake had ended, but my hand was tingling slightly.

Lor, have you heard from him, from Oy?
 She took a lot from him.
 Though I think she’s gone off in her own direction.
 There’s a cartoonist’s simplicity there, those lines, that is both childlike and very sophisticated.
 CM:  	Does she show her stuff?
 BG:  	Shit, I’m lucky if she shows me.
 Once I told her she was like Twombly but with a better sense of humor.
 She sulked for a week.
 Don’t really know why.
 So, I just tell her, man, I love this.

"I'll have enough to explain as it is."
 Inspired by the way he was toying with her hair, she asked, "Would you like to have a lock of my hair?"
 "That's a great idea."
 He bent to inhale its fragrance.
 She took scissors from a drawer and reached for a lock on the back of her head.
 She snipped one off and handed it to Rick.
 "We should find a ribbon to tie it so that the strands won't come lose."
 He fingered the silky lock.
 This was all he'd have left of her.
 Swallowing, he nodded.

I'd pretty much forgotten about the tourism brochure for the city.
 It'd sounded like the perfect job for Mom, albeit a short term one.
 Now it was sounding like it'd been too good to be true.
 The move had been something I'd opposed and then ignored when my opposition hadn't made any difference.
 I didn't know anything about grown-up things like mortgages.
 I'd been too self-absorbed to learn.
 For the first time I felt guilty about making things harder for Mom.
 Surely there was something I could have done to help out, even considering the attacks.
 "They can't do that, can they?
 I mean, if they told you that you had the job they can't take it away, can they?"

Britney was almost jumping up and down.
 "Oh, don't worry, Brandon, I'll give Adri a ride home.
 The poor thing lives all the way out in the Anderson home.
 I've been giving her a ride into school and home almost every day since she moved."
 Brandon was still smiling, but I got the feeling that it was a little more forced.
 "Perfect.
 I'm going to go take care of some stuff then, but I'll see you both tomorrow."
 Mrs. Campbell looked up from the plant she was watering as we walked into the tutoring room.
 "Ah, there you two are.
 Britney, you'll be sitting over there from now on.

Mom's chuckle was almost genuine.
 If Alec hadn't implied she was going to suspect I'd been up to no good, I probably wouldn't have even noticed how off she sounded.
 "You're right, dear.
 I shouldn't have doubted you.
 I just had a few kids come hiking past this morning talking about this massive party the entire school was at last night.
 I know it's completely irrational, but I kept thinking about you there with all that alcohol."
 I was so nervous about answering her question that I didn't realize she was headed over to shut my window until she was already so close that there was no hope of intercepting her.
 Hopefully Alec had kept moving after he'd jumped.
 Otherwise Mom's questions were about to get a bit more pointed.
 "Mom, how could you think that?

He wasn't excited that he had to stay here instead of leading the tracking group.
 I personally was glad he couldn't go along, and not just because it was dangerous work.
 I wasn't positive he'd really come to terms with having killed Brandon.
 "They'll be fine.
 You need to worry about getting better, and nothing else."
 My pout met with just as much success as it usually did.
 After a second or two I gave up and nodded.
 "Okay, I promise to be good and concentrate on getting better, if you'll come keep me company."
 The flash of emotion, barely visible in Alec's eyes, was a source of hope and despair all at once.
 Eagerness, desire.

Rick was stretched out on the bed watching TV when she returned to his room.
 "I'm exhausted," she told him, dropping onto the bed.
 "So am I."
 He took her wrist.
 "Lie down here with me and watch this `Mad About You' rerun."
 His arms went around her when she settled down beside him.
 She sighed and was instantly asleep.
 The last thing Rick remembered was Murray, the dog, drinking out of a toilet.
 When he opened his eyes again, the news was on.
 He yawned, wanting to stretch but finding that Marie lay on one arm.

He hadn't even bothered to consult with me before typing up an answer that was probably completely off base.
 I pulled out my shabbier, but correct, answer and mirrored his action, tossing my bundle on his desk before looking down at his report.
 I skimmed through Alec's answer and felt my anger joined by surprise and just the slightest touch of admiration.
 He struck on exactly the same theory as I had, and done at least as good of job explaining it.
 Maybe even better considering that he took the time to review some of the underlying theory we'd been taught in class.
 I'd just jumped right into the answer.
 "You're right.
 You never even came to class, and you got the right answer.
 Did you cheat?
 Is the answer to this problem out there somewhere on the Internet?"

Ashley takes my temperature on fronting her some of the drugs if they can’t get all the cash, and I can hear Steve coaching her in the background.
 I tell her this is unacceptable.
 She says she’ll get all the money and see me shortly.
 What will happen next with these flakes?
 Do they intend on solving their cash problem by robbing me?
 Will I be pistol whipped, threatened, or shot?
 I’m not some stoned teenager in Waikiki.
 I’m too old for this shit.

I could clearly hear as Principal Gossil cleared his throat and continued.
 "The fifth winner is Ms. Adriana Paige."
 The cheer from my classmates wasn't nearly as loud as the one for Pam, but it didn't matter.
 I'd won a ticket.
 Me, the person who never won anything, was going to get to see the greatest musical of all time.
 I smiled and thanked everyone who yelled back congratulations, and then turned to find Alec staring at me.
 "Congratulations, Adriana.
 Les Misérables is one of the best.
 I hope you enjoy it."
 I thanked him sweetly, and even managed a smile, but I wanted to tell him he was a jerk.

The horse snorted, banked around, and dove straight for the approaching hands.
 A quick spiral avoided the first wave.
 Dieredon clutched his bow and held on for dear life, his eyes locking on the man in black who stood perfectly still, his arms at downward angles from his body.
 The rest of the elves were in full retreat.
 He was the only one left.
 Qurrah watched Dieredon’s approach with a gnawing fear in his chest.
 It seemed no hand could touch this one, the horse possessing dexterity beyond what any creature that size should have.
 Velixar showed no sign of being aware of their approach.
 His eyes had rolled back into his head as he controlled the multitude of magical hands.
 “Be gone,” Qurrah said, firing several pieces of bone.

It didn’t go far, but I hadn’t needed much.
 I reached down and drew out a small leather pouch, its bronzed decorations weathered and worn.
 I laid it aside, reaching back in.
 My fingers closed around a tube, probably a scroll case.
 I had started to take it out when I heard the wheezing growl behind me.
 I froze.
 The stream of profanities that followed was long and harsh; part sounded like it was in another tongue.
 I released the tube and turned slowly toward Fannie.
 She was livid, red-faced and shaking.
 She stepped toward me, and I slid the pouch that lay against my leg behind my sash.

She went up to her room soon after Tom left.
 She hadn't bought a stuffed animal for Rick's t-shirt, so she spread the shirt over a pillow.
 After she'd changed into a nightgown, she clutched his handkerchief in her fist and sat down in the rocking chair by her bed.
 She wished she'd gone to the library today--she'd like to have something to occupy her mind.
 She-- There was a tap at her door.
 "Marie?"
 "Come in."
 Her mother opened the door.
 "Are you feeling all right?"
 "Yes.

The Sorcerer Ravenhurr had been an immoral monster that used those around him for his own selfish desires.
 But Adapt Korin was of a more casual evil; he never passed up the opportunity to hurt those around him, physically or emotionally.
 Ravenhurr had existed in the same body for the full eighteen years of Rodregas’ service, and was hundreds of years old.
 In all his years serving in the tower Ravenhurr had only tried to hold the ceremony three times, each time abandoning the attempt due to the lack of a celestial animal.
 A celestial animal was extremely rare, but required as part of the ceremony for Ravenhurr’s next step up in power.
 In contrast, his assistant, the Adapt Korin, had been going though bodies constantly.
 Worse, he seemed to take great delight in letting people know what fate awaited them.
 Rape and torture of the victims were common occurrences with Korin.
 And Rodregas had dreamed of killing him almost from the start.
 Rodregas had hated Ravenhurr and knew that his Master could have stopped his assistant’s actions with a word.

He swung for her face, turning the blade at the last moment so the flat side struck her.
 The sword smacked off Aurelia’s cheek as if she were made of stone.
 The clear noise rang throughout the forest.
 “What the abyss was that?” Harruq asked.
 Aurelia laughed.
 “I’ve cast an enchantment that protects me from your blades.”
 Harruq looked at his weapons and then shrugged.
 “Interesting.
 Do I get one too?”
 In answer, Aurelia smacked her staff against Harruq’s shin.

I couldn’t tell if the pledge was meant for me or himself.
 The others.
 I had forgotten, lost for so long in my dreams, the bonds I’d hoped would break, the councilmen we’d need to free me.
 I wished I could think clearly.
 I tried to remember what had happened, but could only see flames.
 A flicker of movement caught my eye and I turned to find a hawk perched on the ledge of a balcony.
 Suddenly, I needed fresh air more than anything.
 Chevelle helped me to my feet and I walked, a little wobbly, to the door.
 I had been dressed in a vest of dark leather and slim pants, carved medallions adorning my chest, but my feet were bare as they crossed the polished stone floor of the bedroom, at ease in a place they seemed to know.
 I stepped out into the sun, and I had to steady myself on the stone ledge.

Rodregas started to get up, but quickly decided it was smarter to stay lying down for now.
 “Where did we finish?” he asked.
 “Actually we did pretty good.
 There were more than a few that cannot go on, even if you had won.
 You finished eighth overall in the tournament, with a second place white ribbon for the joust.
 Several of those who would now be higher are too injured to continue.
 So you are now in fourth place overall.
 Geriodon and Nordien were the top two finishers,” said Doi’van.
 Rodregas nodded.
 The pain was easier to manage knowing that at least he was still in the running for the tournament championship.

What had the Council member told Fannie?
 He must have known I was a witness, why else would he have been there?
 I could still see the anger on her face.
 She would accuse me, I was sure.
 Somehow, Evelyn would make this my fault.
 “Well?” Fannie hissed, leaning over to glare at me.
 I jerked back to reality, no idea what she’d been saying.
 “Where were you during the commotion?” she repeated.
 “I’d think if you were at Junnie’s, you’d have known all about it.
 Why didn’t you warn me?” My mouth opened and closed.

Drugs were everywhere.
 In the air.
 When the Beatles dropped acid, when Leary made his famous pronouncement, I mean it was so public.
 Blame it, LSD, on Cary Grant.
 (laughs) At first legal—when I started, Dad, though soon illegal, which is weird.
 I think acid was illegal.
 Is it legal now?
 No, no, it’s not.
 LSD-25, specifically, you know, I mean, everyone had it—it came to Memphis from Frisco on sugar cubes, I think.
 It was at the Bitter Lemon, you know, and I’d go there—I was, shit, I don’t know, 16 or something.

Rachel handed me my last book, and waved to Isaac, who was just now getting up from his table.
 "Hello, Adriana.
 I assume you'll need a ride home today?"
 It was the first time Isaac had actually spoken to me, and I was surprised at how well-spoken he was.
 His voice sounded like a superbly-tuned cello.
 I filed the information away as further evidence he wasn't really our age.
 "Yes please, Brandon can only take me home on Tuesdays and Thursdays."
 It wasn't my imagination; Isaac flinched slightly, and Rachel's smile momentarily turned plastic.
 I mentally kicked myself for having once again stepped squarely between the Capulets and Montagues.
 Isaac recovered with admirable speed, smiling as he gestured us forward.

I hurried back to the kitchen counter and tore a piece of paper off of the tablet I'd been drawing on.
 Whoever you are thank you so much for what you've done.
 Not just for the job, but for smoothing things over with the bank as well.
 I wish there was some way I could repay you for everything.
 --Adriana Chapter 7 My alarm clock jerked me out of a thankfully dream-free slumber.
 Actually, as I pulled myself out of bed I realized I'd had a virtual torrent of dreams, but none of them had been possessed of the strange vividness that'd begun haunting my waking moments.
 I hadn't had one of the special dreams, ergo I hadn't had any dreams last night.
 I really needed to get out of this town before whatever was in the water drove me completely crazy.
 Actually, I probably didn't have much time in which to affect my escape.
 When it came to craziness I was already halfway there.

“You think your sword will do any more than the pathetic archer girl’s arrow?” “Hey,” I shouted, “I’m not a pathetic archer girl!” Oh course, the two ignored me.
 I swear the air sizzled with the tension between Kojas and Seth.
 Seth stood ridged and I was pretty sure that it was taking all of his will power not to jump at Kojas, sword flying.
 “I believe it will,” Seth said through gritted teeth.
 Kojas laughed again but I don’t think any of us saw what was so funny.
 Emily leaned towards me.
 “I think you were right, when you said that I wouldn’t want to meet Kojas.” “Uh-huh,” I said but didn’t really pay attention.
 “I would like to see you try with that sword of yours,” Kojas said and smiled wickedly at Seth.
 I knew he was baiting him.
 Seth narrowed his eyes.

If you would like to share this book with another person, please purchase an additional copy for each recipient.
 Thank you for respecting the hard work of this author.
 Dedication I dedicate this book to my wife Lisa, the one person who has been with me through more ups and downs than anyone could ever imagine.
 You never know when or if the perfect person will appear.
 The fateful night I set eyes on her set in motion everything that would happen to me for the rest of my life.
 I couldn’t be happier that I was fortunate enough to be in the right place at the perfect time to meet my soul mate.
 She is the most beautiful person, both inside and out.
 She has been an inspiration for me and making her happy is the goal of my life.
 We are best friends, confidants, partners, and true lovers and together we are one.
 I can’t imagine my existence without her, and I know that everything I am and all I will become is shaped by her genuine kindness.

Jim – Since you don’t get to make the choice, it doesn’t matter much does it?
 Eugene – No, the only choice you have is whether or not to keep going forward with life after you’re born, and whether or not to have children, well assuming you can find someone to have kids with that is.
 It’s not like we had any choice in the matter.
 We have as much choice in that as we have in who our parents would be.
 We might as well be discussing when and where we were born.
 Johnny – Why are we talking about this?
 Jim – Why not?
 Johnny – Because it’s depressing.
 Eugene – Do you have something you’d rather talk about that isn’t depressing?
 Jim - This ought to be good.

I could see why they used weapons.
 Chevelle pushed harder, assaulting me with faster and stronger swings.
 I was able to defend myself if I focused.
 Murmurs of approval floated in from our audience.
 I enjoyed that more than I probably should have.
 I concentrated hard and began throwing a few good hits of my own in with the blocks.
 Our swords clashed repeatedly, neither of us hitting the mark.
 I was certain he could have, but confident I was blocking well.
 We continued until I became winded, then Chevelle lowered his blade, smiling with approval.
 Our audience commented on the show, and I glanced around to see it was evening already, the sun beginning to set.

With the knowledge the world possesses today, with the example of many successful nations over the last four decades, and with its highly educated and motivated people, surely the nations of Eastern Europe and Central Asia can abridge the time required and the hardship of lessons learned by trial and error to a few years.
 But this cannot be accomplished by sweeping remedies or hastened by over-eagerness or impatience.
 It will require application of a profound understanding of the process of development and transition.
 We believe that a properly conceived effort to draw on the best available knowledge and experience of other countries can generate a transition strategy that avoids the dangers and pitfalls of the initial approach to reform and puts in place the essential foundations for the new system to function effectively and generate benefits for the people before the dawn of the new century.
 In the preceding chapters we have tried to draw attention to the uncommon opportunities that the world presents at the dawn of a new millennium for the abolition of war and the eradication of poverty.
 None will question the desirability of achieving peace, democratic freedoms and prosperity for all.
 But many may doubt the practical feasibility of accomplishing these necessary goals.
 Every great endeavour requires a proportionate investment of energy and resources for its accomplishment.
 The realization of peace and prosperity is no exception.
 What, then, are the resources required for this achievement and where are we to find them?

A wolf.
 He let out a deep breath and it tickled my nose.
 Oh.
 Oh, no.
 No, no, no.
 My head cleared, but Chevelle still held me around the arms.
 My neck flushed, my eyes shooting to my lap.
 I couldn’t look at him.
 What am I doing?
 The door opened and Chevelle’s hands dropped as he stood to face the newcomer.

You know Memphis.
 I really felt like here was a woman made of soul and blood and electricity and philharmonic, eldritch diablerie, you know?
 I thought she was fucking Terpsichore, man.
 And she was so beautiful—she IS so beautiful—that I was stopped like a clock.
 I was a man hit in the heart with a sledgehammer.
 She just reached out and took my hand.
 It was that simple, that profound.
 She was looking right into me, like I was a sideshow mirror, and maybe I was, man.
 Distorting images, throwing off suncats.
 She saw it all, clear as crystal.

When I decided to kill Ravenhurr, I promised the gods that if they let me survive, I would take on the duty of killing the Immortalists.
 It is a duty that I know will end in my death.
 There are hundreds of Immortalists.
 Some almost as powerful as gods, but it is a good death and one I have chosen.” Rodregas paused and looked at Doi’van’s features.
 They were brutish and rough by human standards, but his instincts said that this man was honest, and he added, “If for a while you wish to share my duty and fight at my side, then we walk a path bathed in the Celestial light.” Rodregas had spoken slowly and clearly so Doi’van would understand the depth of what he said.
 They stood there gripping each other’s forearms and then Doi’van nodded and replied, “Then let us walk this path together.” He was speaking in that deep voice; his statement had finality about it.
 It was a good moment, one of those moments when two people realize that they are going to share the path of life and possibly death.
 It did not last long for as they broke their grip Imeralda said, “All right, you two are pretty tough and all, but don’t expect me to join in this crazy crusade.
 Do you know how many thousands  of wannabe heroes have died over the years trying to stop the Immortalist’s preying on the rest of us?” She seemed to shiver for a second and then took a breath and said, “I won’t join you in your crusade, but I will try to help you as I can.” Rodregas nodded and said “Fair enough,” and then reached out to her with the same grip; the grip of one equal warrior to another.
 She seemed surprised at his gesture.

I will pack the extra with me.” I managed a sheepish smile.
 It seemed like I needed things explained a lot lately.
 “Where will you go?” “Back to the village.” “To council?” I breathed.
 “They sent you to find me?” Her bright blue eyes flicked to Chevelle and back.
 “No, Freya.
 They will not know I saw you.” “They are looking for me?” Terror crept into my voice.
 I was Chevelle’s captive, but he’d given me some sort of reprieve.
 The thought of council brought the danger of my situation to the forefront.
 “No.
 They will not risk it.” “They are afraid,” Chevelle said from his spot by the fire.

Our mother was intelligent, at least for an orc, but was she smart enough to leave us clues within our own names?”
 “Well, he’s dead now, so we’ll never know,” Harruq said, tossing the blade onto the floor.
 Qurrah, however, was far from dismayed.
 He grinned at his brother and then spoke in his hissing voice.
 “Would you like to have a conversation with our dear old dad?” he asked.

 The body of Ahrqur Tun’del lay atop several strange markings and shapes drawn in the dirt.
 He remained wrapped in the blankets and sheets the two half-orcs had used to smuggle him out of his house.

Do you need something?"
 "Donovan, Alec said I could go watch them work out.
 Will you take me to wherever they are?"
 He dried his hands on a blisteringly white towel, and nodded.
 "Of course.
 I believe they are in the north end of the valley.
 Right this way."
 We made good time, even with Donovan's jerky, oftentimes painful gait, but the estate was even bigger than I'd realized.
 We walked for several minutes before rounding a corner and finding the entrance to a hedge maze.
 "We're very nearly there.

Few have been able to ignite the aspiration for continuous learning and the capacity for original creativity that are the most profound characteristics of human consciousness.
 Measured in these terms, even the most developed nations still have a long way to go and much that can be done to further the development of their people.
 To sum up, 10 years ago when we presented the report of the International Commission on Peace and Food, we were optimistic that humankind will grasp the uncommon opportunities provided by democratic systems of governance and technological and knowledge revolutions for achieving a world without hunger and where every individual has an opportunity for a productive and healthy life.
 The onward march of technology is still in full swing, but the political commitment to foster cooperative human security worldwide is yet to emerge.
 The Information Age has given meaning and content to the concept of a global village.
 The threats associated with climate change and biodiversity loss also underline the fact that while humankind may be segregated by political frontiers, our fates are intertwined ecologically.
 Economically also, islands of prosperity cannot co-exist forever in the midst of oceans of poverty.
 Both unsustainable lifestyles and unacceptable poverty must become features of the past, if we are to curb the growing violence in the human heart.
 Ten years after presentation of our report, we remain convinced that universal health, harmony and happiness are still within our reach, if only we imbibe the eternal truth contained in the following message of Lord Krishna delivered on the battlefield of life called Kurukshetra:
 We human beings can become whatever we sincerely aspire to become.

Qurrah inhaled deeply and began casting his spell.
 The words of magic were similar to those when he raised the eight corpses back in Cornrows.
 The bigger half-orc was aware of subtle differences, but had little clue to what they were.
 Words of power were beyond his understanding.
 The body quivered, but it was not a physical quiver.
 Translucent silver crept about the wraps.
 Blue smoke floated into the air.
 The blue and silver grew thicker and thicker.
 Qurrah’s words grew louder, more powerful, and then Ahrqur’s spirit ripped into the air, a glowing blue-silver form of insanity.
 The spirit looked much as he did in life, except his clothes were different.

He kept walking as he looked my direction, surveying the damage from the fire.
 I was convinced he would know it had been me, but he didn’t stop or even slow.
 It made no sense.
 Why hadn’t he investigated further?
 Was he not here looking for me?
 He was my watcher and I was missing.
 So where else would he be going?
 Before I had, regrettably, torched the documents, I had seen Junnie noted as his contact.
 My pulse sped at the idea that he might be going to her, to get her help in finding me.
 If he was my watcher, I’d be his responsibility, and she was the only one who knew me at all aside from Fannie.

Then, softer, “We won’t even tell Junnie.” I didn’t understand.
 The cold, wet ground seeped through the material covering my legs, and I shifted, fidgeting as I looked up at him.
 “I mean I can’t do magic, just useless stuff… lighting candles…” “Then we start with fire,” he said.
 Chevelle lowered his hand to mine and stood, pulling me up and toward the center of the clearing.
 When we’d distanced ourselves from the tree line, he stopped and turned back to me, still holding my right hand.
 My eyes followed his as he looked down at our clasped hands and a cool blue flame lit on my right sleeve.
 Immediately, my free hand jerked up to extinguish it.
 Chevelle took it to keep me from smacking at the flame, which had already disappeared.
 “No,” he said, “use the magic.
 Feel it.” I nodded and he returned his gaze to our hands, now both connected.

It didn’t make sense.
 I knew I had been assigned a watcher.
 From the North.
 “No one?” I asked.
 “No.
 Council does not attempt to rule the North.” I considered that, considered my watcher.
 He was a volunteer.
 I seethed for a moment, but flashes of my mother and council cloaks flooded my thoughts and I had to block them.
 “So the North… has no council at all?” His answer was uncomfortable.
 “No.

The cheerleader types.
 I think my first blowjob was on the school playground, off in a corner, where there was this big bush.
 Cathy Ceccerelli.
 Man, she was hot, I mean for a thirteen year old.
 Great braids that hung on either side of her face.
 And the first girl in our class to get tits.
 She was something else—she let me touch her naked ass, showed me it right before she unzipped me and took me into her mouth.
 (laughs) I didn’t even know what was happening.
 I kept thinking, is this right?
 Is this something humans are supposed to do?

The stinging, however, paled compared to the previous night.
 He sat up, cradling his right arm.
 A look around showed no sign of Velixar or his undead.
 The morning continued to be full of delightful surprises.
 The elf pulled out a roll of thick cloth from a knapsack and began bandaging his wounds.
 “Aurelia, we need to talk,” Dieredon said while fashioning a sling for his right arm.
 “Those half-orcs have some very interesting friends.”
 He stood, tested the tightness of his bandages, took up his bow, and then headed for town.

His brother heard and obeyed.
 The two met at the edge of town.
 They saw scattered groups of families not far in the distance.
 “Get them, my brother,” Qurrah ordered.
 “None may live or they will tell of the half-orcs who destroyed their town.”
 “Then they’re dead,” Harruq said, clanging his swords together.
 Power crackled through them.
 He took up the chase.

I was afraid to scare him too much, so I decided on a small gesture.
 I held my hand out in front of me, emphasizing the action as I twisted my wrist in the air, the boar’s head spinning, the sound of its neck cracking in tandem with my movement.
 He gasped and stepped back from me.
 I was afraid for a moment I’d shown him too much.
 He looked at my face, searching, and finally let out a breathless, “Magic.” His face was filled with wonder.
 I had seen many impressed with my talents, but never with such an effortless show.
 I laughed to myself.
 It was refreshing to have someone so genuinely awed.
 He didn’t ask to see what else I could do; he wasn’t sizing me up for battle.
 I smiled at him and he seemed to think that alone a reward.

Peace was accompanied by partial economic collapse in Eastern Europe.
 It was evident from the outset that the transition in these countries would not be smooth or easy and that the destiny of the world in the twenty-first century would be influenced decisively by the outcome.
 Severe food shortages in the Soviet Union, which angered the long-suppressed population and compelled the government to take radical action, once again highlighted the linkages between peace and food.
 Production dropped precipitously as frantic efforts were made to reverse economic decline by radical measures.
 Although these events were closely observed and strongly assisted by top international experts, the world lacked both the conceptual knowledge and the practical experience needed to guide these nations through their crisis.
 At the invitation of the Soviet Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Commission's next meeting, in November 1990, was held in Moscow: it would examine the challenges facing the USSR during the shift to democracy and a civilian market economy, and identify steps to improve the food supply, speed military conversion and ease the economic transition.
 The immediate euphoria over the rapid reduction in tensions between East and West freed public attention to focus on other pressing problems and generated great expectations that a 'peace dividend' would usher in a period of rapid economic progress for developing countries.
 Yet, despite a remarkable one-third reduction in worldwide defence spending from peak levels in the 1980s, foreign aid budgets continued to shrink.
 This prompted us to examine the potential benefits that could be derived from transferring or redirecting scientific, technological, educational and productive resources from military applications to support development and the environment.
 At the same time, increasing pressure was mounted by donors on aid-dependent developing countries to reduce their own defence spending, often with out consideration for the genuine security concerns of these countries.

Guess asking you to stop wouldn’t work for me after all.
 Liz – I told you that you should start lifting weights, besides you might look cute in a leather jacket.
 Jim – I think it’s easier not to piss large men off, then they have no reason to hurt me, and I have no reason to life weights, so I don’t need large muscles.
 Unless you count the appeal to chicks.
 Besides working out would require going out in that hot weather under that big hot shiny bright thing.
 Liz – A little exercise out in the sunshine won’t hurt you.
 Jim – Maybe, maybe not, but it would cut into my video game time.
 In the end that’s all that really matters.
 Eugene – Hello?

Another graceful gesture flipped on the set of soft lights surrounding its border.
 As always with Alec's paintings, it took me a second before I could shift my perspective enough to translate the beautiful formations of light into something I could tie to the drab, dreary world I inhabited.
 It was the same grotto where we now stood.
 The warm glow from the climbing ivory and roses formed a backdrop awash in the silvery light of a full moon.
 Just visible off to one side was the pool, alive with enough microscopic life to give it a pale glow of its own to compliment the off-center reflection of a hundred tiny lights.
 A few seconds later I finally recognized that the subject of the piece was a female, reaching out towards the point of view with glowing hands.
 "She's beautiful.
 It's how I always imagined an angel would appear."
 Alec was silent for so long I finally tore my gaze from his masterpiece long enough to find that he was staring at me with surprise.
 "It's you, Adri.

I attempted patience, since I was their guest and because I remembered Tony’s stories that placed him in the low range of this crowd’s toughness.
 But at last I mouthed a comeback.
 The Polish fellow threw a punch that landed square on my jaw.
 I staggered.
 He tackled me.
 I fell and my head whacked the concrete floor.
 The next I knew, several guys were pounding various parts of me.
 I couldn’t seem to move from the waist up.
 Maybe one or more of them held me down.
 But I threw a few kicks.

 Cindy:  the great one himself, Ronald McDonald!
 He is an inspiration to clowns everywhere.

“Are you okay?” She nodded vigorously.
 “Yes, it’s just hard work to use my magic.
 I need a lot of concentration.” We all ducked behind a half-dead tree to escape from the swarms of monsters.
 We were breathing heavily.
 I leaned my head against the tree’s cold bark, wanting to disappear from it all.
 “Where’s Seth?” Emily asked.
 I raised my head.
 “We haven’t found him yet.” Her eyes widened.
 “What do you mean, you haven’t found him yet?” “I crashed into Jazell, who was doing, like, forty,” Jason pointed to me.
 “Then we both found you fighting beasts with your fiery fingertips of death.” She raised an eyebrow.

You get where I am going with this.
 I always found it ignorant when someone would advise me how to raise my child when they had no children at all or they had children younger than mine.
 The most absurd statements begin with the words “my children will never."
 I never offered advice to any parent, and I never welcomed a statement about raising my children that began with the words “you should.” I have always tried to be the best dad I could be, because it was up to me to make their upbringing different than mine.
 I coached their soccer, baseball and football teams for many seasons.
 I walked my boys to school, helped with their homework (as much as I could) and I tried to be an important part of their lives as well as a positive influence.
 As I continued to succeed in business, our lifestyle improved.
 Throughout their childhoods, we’ve had a good life and a beautiful home, nice cars, good communities, and the best of schools.
 I encouraged their interests by making sure they had the equipment they needed to pursue them.
 For instance, when Brandon showed a real interest in and talent for photography, he received his dream camera for Christmas.

Jim – Put the worse possible face on things, all while managing to scare me to the point that I fear for my life.
 Art- I don’t always do it.
 Only when it would be really funny.
 Jim – How does now make it really funny?
 Art – It’s about time I passed on my extensive knowledge about women.
 Jim – (nearly dies laughing) Right.
 Art – I was speaking in relative terms.
 Jim – Relative to what?
 Art – Relative to your understanding of women.
 Jim – But I don’t understand them what-so-ever.

He glanced back to the shed, cursing his idiocy for not retrieving his weapons while he had the chance.
 “The coin,” demanded a guard to their right.
 “Hand it over.”
 “No,” Harruq said.
 The leader rammed his fist into the half-orc’s face.
 Harruq staggered but held his ground.
 Blood ran down his face, and he spat some away from his mouth.
 He waited for another punch, but nothing came.
 The man was staring in total disbelief at the weapon he held.
 As he had stepped closer to punch, the gem at the end had shimmered a soft green.

“Although I don’t know why.

 “Getting tired of tests,” Harruq said.
 “Keep such thoughts buried and dead.” Qurrah pointed to the door.
 The cloud of darkness waited.

Lor and I rented a cabin up on the White River and we just hid away.
 I didn’t write a fucking thing, didn’t even read the newspapers.
 I don’t mean to imply that I could have done something, that I had any more power than the Pope or The Beatles or, you know, fucking McNamara.
 I mean, though, that I wanted to know, I wanted to understand.
 I wanted the information that Walter Cronkite or Eric Sevareid had, the insider stuff, so that I wasn’t just up there entertaining the fuel for the fire, you know, like the orchestras that played as the Jews were led into the ovens.
 I started to feel like that, that I was a chimp, a dancing fool.
 This was like before The Moratorium, right?
 Before we really all felt the power.
 The War was just this endless one-note playing over and over and driving us insane—me insane, sorry, driving me insane.
 And, like, I know that a song is just a song—yet, I have to believe there is something there, an element, a catalytically charged element.

“Stop, you cannot defeat him,” she shouted.
 None listened.
 “Felewen, please!”
 Felewen glanced back to her, and that small pause saved her life.
 The man in black had made no threatening move as the other two charged.
 They were almost upon him when he cast aside his hood to reveal his ever-changing face, his deep red eyes, and his horrible smile.
 His hands lunged forward, the floodgates opened, and all his power came rushing forth.
 A wall of black magic rolled like a tidal wave conjured from his fingertips.
 The elven brothers tumbled through and vanished.
 Felewen leapt back when she saw the attack coming.

This is still the hour in which anything can happen, provided we are determined to make it happen.
 It is not a question of possibility or prediction, but of decision and determination to walk the talk.
 Peace & Security
 Nuclear Disarmament: The threat of a nuclear holocaust remains very real so long as stockpiles of these weapons remain in existence – their very existence constitutes a threat – and so long as nations or groups insist on the prerogative of manufacturing, possessing and using them.
 While the number of nuclear missiles and bombs has been dramatically reduced, both the USA and Russia retain thousands of such weapons.
 The number of nuclear weapons states has increased and the threat of first use has been extended to Israel, the Indian subcontinent and the Korean peninsula.
 South Africa and some former Soviet republics have voluntarily relinquished their claims as nuclear weapons states.
 Few realize that the catastrophic damage caused by the atomic bombing of Japan at the end of World War II dwindles into insignificance when compared with the destructive power and radioactive fall-out that would result from the explosion of even the smallest nuclear device today.
 Until the last nuclear weapon has been destroyed, the threat of accidental or intentional usage remains very real and very serious.
 The nuclear weapon states must come forward to fulfil the commitments made in the non-proliferation treaties by taking active and immediate steps leading to total nuclear disarmament by all powers within the shortest possible time.

But it didn’t matter now.
 I walked forward, resigned to my fate.
 What I didn’t expect was their response.
 The throne room was full.
 And not one of them did not gasp when comprehension hit.
 But my father, and each of those present, seemed… pleased when they saw me.
 They had no idea there was a… human… growing in the belly my hands now cradled.
 I listened as their voices began, and then rose, clamorously discussing the news and what it could bring.
 I cringed as their words turned to the possibilities, the power I might pass down, the strength the new one might bring.
 “We will leave at daybreak,” Grey informed Ruby as I read.

 He hasn’t bothered to get in the way for the last hour or so.
 Jim – How long did it take you to notice that dad?
 He’s almost always in the way when it comes to Thanksgiving dinner.
 Karen – He said he had some things to do before dinner.
 Art – Did he say when he would be back?
 Karen – Just later.
 Jim – He’ll be here, its his favorite holiday.
 Karen – I didn’t know that Johnny was so sentimental.
 Art – He isn’t, he just likes the food.

“Stronger,” he said.
 “Tougher.
 Whatever work you got two men doing, I can do alone.
 Whatever hours you got them working, I can do double.”
 “A large boast,” Alvrik said.
 He took the bone out of his mouth and pointed at Harruq’s ears.
 “You got orc blood in you.”
 “I do.”
 “Will that be a problem?” Alvrik asked.
 “Up to all the others you hire,” Harruq said.

I wasn't particularly hungry, but I couldn't lose much more weight without Mom dragging me into a doctor.
 Besides, it gave me an excuse to try and ignore the fact that half of the people in the room seemed to be staring at me when they thought I wasn't looking.
 I finally worked up enough courage to look across the cafeteria as I peeled the label off of the can.
 Alec wasn't at his usual place, but Brandon was at his normal table, surrounded by a smaller than normal group.
 The discussion looked way more intense than normal, and seemed to center around him and Cassie.
 It was all so crazy.
 Two weeks ago my life had revolved around my inability to think of certain things without collapsing.
 That hadn't changed, but now there was a distinct possibility Jasmin was going to hurt me just to ensure I stayed silent.
 Oh, and I was actually considering opening myself up for some very nasty ridicule, just on the infinitesimally slim chance a boy who was so popular, rich, and gorgeous that he shouldn't even know my name might be interested in me.
 Life was supposed to get better as you got older, but it was starting to look like it just got more complicated.

“I do not fear you,” she hissed through clenched teeth.
 A wall of water swirled about her, flowing from the otherwise dry dirt street.
 She sent it forward, just as tall and high as Velixar’s.
 The two met in a thunderous roar, intermixing in a maelstrom of darkness, water, and air.
 Then they both dissolved, their magic spent.
 Aurelia held back tears.
 Velixar’s magic had peeled the flesh from the elves’ bodies.
 Blood leaked through muscle and tendon, and their innards spilled from their abdomens.
 She hoped they died instantly, but she knew better.
 They had suffered tremendously.

So, he had to use brute strength to shatter the doors one by one.
 Several of the books fell during his struggles with the cabinet.
 Rodregas reached down and grabbed a couple of them, and then dropped them right back to the ground in shock as evil licked his hand.
 He shook the feeling off his hand and went back to the water closet and washed it in the water basin.
 Of course he knew there was nothing physically on his hand, but he also knew that water was a natural purifier and disrupted many magical influences.
 What he had felt was simply disgusting.
 Why would a book, no matter what its contents, have such a feel to it?
 He walked back to the book and got down on the ground.
 Without actually touching it, Rodregas slowly ran his fingertips along the binder of the book.
 While the feeling was not as strong as when he had held it, clearly the feeling of what could only be described as evil emanated from the book.

 “Wake up, Qurrah.”
 The half-orc lifted his eyelids to see the thoroughly unwelcoming sight of Velixar frowning down at him.
 “Yes, master?” he asked, puzzled, for it was still before dawn.
 He had slept no more than a few hours, he figured.
 “Who is it your brother travels with now?” Velixar asked.
 “You say he has abandoned you, but to whom?”
 “An elf named Aurelia,” Qurrah said as he sat up.
 He rubbed his eyes, still feeling groggy.

My pulse was already almost twice as fast as normal, and the room was just starting to wobble from side to side.
 Rachel was saying something, but I couldn't really hear her.
 The void was gaping below me, when something grabbed my shoulder and shook me surprisingly hard.
 I opened my eyes to see Rachel looking at me.
 "I'm sorry I had to do that, Adriana, but you need to hear what I have to say."
 Half of me wanted to be angry, but the other half just wanted to collapse into the void.
 Force of habit won over anger and I passively let my defenses crumble, but apparently being shocked out of a collapse functioned much the same as having just come out of an attack.
 For the next few seconds at least I was safe, could think about anything I wanted without fear of the repercussions.
 Only Rachel was talking, ruining my concentration, so the only thing I could focus on was her words.
 "The rumor revolves around the fact that you tragically lost your boyfriend in a vicious car wreck."

It should've terrified me that something new was bringing on an episode, but it was like there was so much else going wrong I couldn't spare any more emotional energy.
 I came out of the attack and remained on the floor thinking about all of the good times I'd had with Dad and Cindi.
 The memories should have made me feel better, but they had the opposite effect.
 I felt the tears start again as I realized all that goodness and joy was gone from my life forever.
 As my immunity started to wear off, I gratefully surrendered to the next attack, and the blissful relief it represented.
 I knew I was on track to drop back into the funk that'd robbed me of the weeks immediately after they died, but I was still strangely numb in the parts that should have cared.
 It seemed like I was on my third iteration, but it might have been the fourth or fifth.
 I was too detached to care.
 The knock on the door at least brought me back to myself enough to wonder how long I'd been on the floor.
 My ankle hurt so bad, it was all I could do to get myself standing and then hobble the fifteen feet to the door.

The upward job displacement that earlier shifted job opportunities from agriculture to industry now shifts them to higher-skilled jobs in manufacturing and services.
 The negative side-effects of this process on some sections of the population alert us to areas where society must make special efforts to speed their development.
 As in the case of technology, research is needed to document this complex process across industries, between countries and over time.
 One product of these studies could be the development of specific job coefficients measuring the impact of growth in trade in different industries on overall employment.
 Trade becomes of even greater potential benefit to industrial nations during the coming decade when economic growth in these countries is expected to be significantly slower than in the developing world.
 The pent-up demand generated by the destruction of Europe during the Second World War, the rapid expansion of population during the baby boom generation, and the explosion of new technologies in the past few decades, all generated strong internal demand in the OECD countries, resulting in steady economic growth.
 The slow growth of population and productivity in more recent years means that these factors cannot be expected to drive further economic expansion at the same rate.
 In contrast, average growth rates in developing countries are expected to be two to three times higher than in the industrial nations.
 The increase in the dollar output of developing countries was actually bigger than that of the most economically advanced nations in 1992 and 1993, and this trend is expected to continue.
 Measured in terms of purchasing power parity, developing countries now represent more than one-third of the world economy.

"Won't you consider staying here with me?
 Marrying me?"
 Her throat tightened, and she pulled her chin free, shaking her head.
 "I can't."
 She gripped his hands.
 "It's like a lifeline.
 I love you, and I love 2011, but if I let go of my home, I'd be lost."
 Rick reached into his pocket, taking out his handkerchief and handing it to her.
 She started to wipe her face with it but then stopped.
 Rick frowned as she stared at it.

A careful analysis of the relationship between culture and development reveals that cultural values are the essential foundation for all lasting social achievement.
 The security, stability, productivity, growth and sustainability of society are determined by its values.
 This report calls upon nations and the international community to make a conscious shift to values that can generate greater domestic and international security, higher rates of sustainable growth, and more equitable distribution of benefits for all.
 The insistence on immediate abolition of war, eradication of poverty, democratic human rights and full employment expresses a commitment to the pre-eminent values of human life, social and economic as well as political freedom, and the development of the full potential of the individual.
 The achievement of these high human values also requires the achievement of a large number of physical, organizational, social and psychological values: higher productivity, better quality, more efficient utilization of resources, faster speed, more systematic functioning, improved coordination and cooperation, punctuality, cleanliness, open-mindedness, tolerance, harmony and a host of other values essential for high achievement in any field.
 Therefore, we have stressed repeatedly the importance of the value of integration in the formulation of strategies, of maximum utilization of human and social as well as material and technological resources, of greater speed and organization, and other values.
 Values are a powerful instrument to spur development.
 They are goals or standards that set the direction and mobilize the collective cultural energies of the society for great accomplishment.
 They prompt us to strive for the maximum that is conceivable, rather than the mini mum that is achievable.
 Values form the basis for the tremendous developmental achievements of the past two hundred years, such as the Japanese commitment to teamwork and consensus, the American devotion to enterprise and innovation, the German dedication to quality, and the Dutch commitment to partnership with other people, rather than exploitation.

If only he could convince her to stay here with him.
 He was sure that she'd eventually come to accept the fact that she wasn't going to be able to get back home, but he was afraid they'd end up making love before she'd reached that point.
 And while making love on their wedding night would be a wonderful, earth-shattering experience for them both, he knew that making love before marriage would probably have disastrous results for her--and therefore for him.
 So he had to convince her to stay.
 And to marry him.
 Sighing, Rick rose and went to take a cold shower.
 Marie's door was closed, and the light was off, so he assumed she'd done as he'd suggested and gone to bed.
 Marie was in bed.
 Quietly crying into her pillow.

My attention should be entirely on the task at hand and not the events in my life that lead me here, but my mind hiccoughs.
 I am here because this is where the drug dealers will meet me.
 They have $2500 in cash in exchange for the one hundred 80 milligram Oxycontin tablets which are in a small plastic bottle, tucked away into my jacket pocket.
 I have just turned fifty years old, which is older than the combined age of the young couple who will be meeting me.
 It is early 2009, and the drug I have in my pocket was not even available when I was a teenager.
 In my younger days the contents in my pocket would have been cocaine or marijuana, but times have changed.
 The eventual recipients of these pills will be the addicts who crave them more than a next meal or the love of their family, or anything for that matter.
 The pills are small, round and an odd green color—a powerful prescription drug manufactured to relieve severe pain.
 They are essentially synthetic heroin, and much sought after by the drug addicts who litter your streets, work alongside you and perhaps sit next to you at a family dinner.
 They are daughters or sons or parents.

 .” Whereas Don Merritt thinks I’m crazy, I prefer the word loco, which in my vocabulary means something less judgmental.
 More like wacky.
 Still, if don't write and share these loco thoughts of mine, not as many people will get to know about Eric, and Olga.
 No doubt Don will read my vision of Eric’s death as sacrifice and consider it a symptom of a narcissistic belief that the world revolves around me.
 The problem I find with such an explanation is, it wouldn’t answer a single question about why Eric knew all he did.
 So I’ll risk having friends like Don intervene to get me committed.
 Because, even if I only saw a long shot chance that Eric died to rescue me, from death, from perdition, from a wasted life, or from a danger I can’t imagine, consider what a cold-blooded wretch I would have to be if I failed to give him his due.
 And Olga was so beautiful, I won't allow her to be forgotten.

 They sat close together holding hands as they listened to a mystery program.
 Marie wasn't paying attention.
 She was trying to think of a way to get Davis' arm around her.
 Or her head on his shoulder.
 Preferably both.
 Maybe .
 .
 .
 She yawned.

He had expected death.
 He had also expected darkness.
 Instead, the welcoming light of morning met his eyes when he leaned up and looked around.
 The elf smiled, then laughed.
 They had walked right over him but not seen him.
 “Thank you, Celestia,” he said, his smile remaining even as the pain in his ribs and shoulder reawakened.
 The stinging, however, paled compared to the previous night.
 He sat up, cradling his right arm.
 A look around showed no sign of Velixar or his undead.
 The morning continued to be full of delightful surprises.

He whipped out his sword and slashed the arrow in half right before it hit him.
 The pieces fell on the ground.
 Holy tamale.
 I stared at the cracked pieces of my arrow and my flare of determination went out with a poof.
 Great, now what do I do?
 That was a fail, I scolded myself.
 A FAIL!
 “Nice try,” Seth whispered and I think he really meant it.
 Or maybe he was teasing me.
 It’s hard to tell in these situations.

I want more direct contact.
 I wanna sit down with you and talk about life, man, because it’s hard, you know?
 In the dark, in our closed rooms, it’s hard.
 That’s what I’m saying.
 Lonely’s ok when you’re seventeen, but, man, we’re not seventeen anymore.
 I wanna talk about that.
 I mean, I love performing, but I also gotta spend time just playing for me, just me and the guitar, so I learn the message, so I understand.
 CM:  	Let’s backtrack a little.
 I wanna talk about “Turntable Poison,” in particular some of the things that have been written about it.
 Some analysts of the record see things in it, which I’ve heard you deny, yet, there does seem to be something underneath the surface of these songs, something darker.

Art – Has he shot himself yet?
 Or someone else?
 Karen – Not yet.
 Actually last I heard he was married again and they have two kids.
 Art – Well he seems to have bounced back from all the pain and humiliation, he must be a resilient young man.
 Karen – Well, he did leave the home first.
 He had to get away from not only the family, but the community.
 He comes from a small town, and everyone knew what happened.
 I think he married a girl from Russia, one of those mail-order brides.
 I think that she was desperate to get out of Russia.

I should have been surprised when we rounded a corner to find Brandon casually leaning against the wall, obviously waiting for us, for me.
 "You still okay to go home with Brit today?"
 He acted like it was all my choice.
 It gave me goose bumps.
 Britney almost tripped over herself assuring Brandon that we were still the best of friends, and she wouldn't even think of leaving me without a ride.
 Obviously if it wasn't convenient for him to take me, she would love to make sure I got home okay.
 Brandon's face remained serious through Britney's torrent of words, but he winked at me when she looked down to catch her breath.
 "Perfect.
 I'll go take care of some stuff then.
 You two enjoy all of that math, and I'll see you tomorrow morning.

I still can’t make sense of it.
 Eugene – Nobody else could either.
 Art – He was doing so well.
 Jim – Wait a minute that’s an ‘f’.
 Liz – He was doing a lot better.
 Eugene – He had actually been smiling the last couple months.
 Jim – Hmmmmm…
 Art – That damn kid.
 Why did he do it?
 Jim – Didn’t say.

It was in a perfect circle.
 He had taken in the essence of the Celestial Lion back at Raven Keep, and now Rodregas would consume his own magical power with the greater sigil of a Celestial Lion and become a perfect vessel for its power.
 Rodregas forced himself to step back.
 This was their chance for Doi’van, and he would get a second chance if needed.
 He looked over at the other two.
 Once Rodregas had turned around from the lion, Doi’van started to walk between the pedestals joining Imeralda at looking around.
 He stood in front of the great six-legged stallion, the kind of steed the Gods themselves ride, and then walked over to the Great White Stag of the forest and then to the giant eagle that guarded the Celestial sky.
 It was a sight to take the breath from any mortal, a score of beasts that appeared to have been taken right from the heavens.
 “How were the greater sigils created?” Rodregas wondered.
 While the leaser sigils appeared to be simple sculpture empowered by magic, these truly appeared real.

"Why is that selfish?
 Most people would think you were being quite charitable taking the new girl to the big dance when you could have your pick of anyone in the school and half the females in the state."
 Alec slowly reached over and took my hand for the first time since we'd sat down.
 The sudden surge of tingly, pleasant energy nearly distracted me from the fact he was very carefully not meeting my eyes.
 "Can you feel that?
 I mean, it feels good, doesn't it?"
 I felt smiles tug at the corner of my lips as a giggle bubbled in my chest.
 "I think it's supposed to feel good, silly."
 My laughter died at his lack of matching mirth.
 "Have you ever wondered about my mom?

He slipped some money to the cashier while I was still trying to come up with a response that didn't sound stupid.
 "Um, yeah.
 We just got into town last night."
 He handed me the bottle of water.
 "Well I hope you'll like it here."
 "Wait, what's this for?"
 The grin was back, and his teeth were still perfect.
 "I just made you spill yours, it's only fair."
 Brandon nodded at Britney, who stood there with her mouth slightly open, as he walked away.
 After a second or two of both of us staring blankly after Brandon, Britney grabbed me by the hand, the one holding the new, unopened water bottle, and pulled me over to a table in the corner.

The pages directly from the record-keeper’s report all included the same Council mark plus a string of characters.
 Trying to decode them, I realized one of the symbols might simply be a page number.
 And the others, they were probably locators.
 I felt like a fool.
 They were just like the codes used in the library, only more elaborate.
 No one really used the ciphers, you didn’t need them with magic, but they had been added to many of the pages when the fairies had started tracking clan histories.
 I was holding in my hand the information I needed to find the northern clans in the Council’s library.
 My stomach tightened, but I found myself getting up and heading toward the village, regardless of the consequence.
 I argued with that impulsive part of me the entire way to town.
 I shouldn’t do it.

Liz – He’s right, you would have been teased no matter, this way you at least showed some profit.
 Eugene – The out-pouring of love is overwhelming.
 Jim – I know I know, with friends like us, who needs mobs of angry prank victims.
 Liz – Could be worse.
 Eugene – Yes it could.
 And before you decide that it would be funny to make it so, I’m going home.
 Jim – But Godzilla, we have so much to ask about.
 Gene – Like what?
 Jim – Will you take this stuff home with you?

So what are you two talking about?
 Jim & Johnny – Eugene.
 Liz – The legal problems?
 Johnny – What else.
 Liz – Good point, he has been well behaved lately.
 At least as far as I know.
 I guess there isn’t much else to talk about.
 (To Jim) So you know that Art isn’t allowed to adopt him.
 Jim – That’s what Johnny was saying.
 How is Gene taking it all?

"I'm fine, Mom.
 I just got a little dizzy."
 I didn't want to talk to her.
 What I really wanted to do was enjoy the short immunity fainting usually granted me.
 For a minute or so I could think about Dad and Cindi with impunity.
 I think Mom had figured that out though.
 Nothing I'd tried recently had been equal to the task of getting her to leave me alone, or at least in silence, right after an episode.
 She was probably worried I'd go back to how I was immediately after it all happened.
 I'd lost a couple of weeks there, alternately triggering a panic attack and then thinking about Dad or Cindi until the immunity wore off and another attack ensued.
 Mom had flipped out.

“Do not lie to me.
 I have watched you two slaughter my brethren.
 I have seen much of your handiwork.” The elf glared at him, ugly hatred skewing his handsome features.
 “By now your brother is dead.
 Three of my best warriors await him around that corner.
 I thought it appropriate you knew this before I took your life.”
 “Do not talk to me of what is appropriate,” Qurrah said.
 “Kill me, if you will, but do not bore me with your chatter.
 I have suffered beyond anything you can do to me.”
 A firestorm of anger overwhelmed the elf’s features.

I fumbled, for the latch, but Rachel put a hand on my arm before I could get the door open.
 She handed me a white-wrapped package with a shy smile.
 "Hang in there.
 Oh, and happy birthday.
 Don't open it now, but I hope you like it."
 I whispered thanks as I hugged her goodbye, and then made my halting, limping way into the house.
 I was only in the house for fifteen minutes before I realized being all by myself was a terrible idea.
 At some point I transitioned from just crying to having a full-blown panic attack.
 It should've terrified me that something new was bringing on an episode, but it was like there was so much else going wrong I couldn't spare any more emotional energy.
 I came out of the attack and remained on the floor thinking about all of the good times I'd had with Dad and Cindi.

Her hatred of their unknown master grew.
 He was a puppet-master, and her dear friend was one of his puppets.
 If they still doubted, even for a moment, perhaps she could save them.
 Perhaps there was still time to pull them from the necromancer’s cold fingers.
 Aurelia turned and ran for the forest.
 Dieredon had not known of her spying, but she would tell him everything.
 If there was any hope, it was in his skill with blade and bow.
 To free the puppets, one must cut the strings.
 It was time for Dieredon to slay the man in black.
