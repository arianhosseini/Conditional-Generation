I like some of the lyrics, which are a little plain, despite the ornate title of the song.
 CM:  	And, that’s just you and your guitar.
 BG:  	Right.
 Actually, recorded here at home, right over there, in the corner by the bookcases.
 I set up a mike in the corner, turned my back to the room, and used the wall of books as organic echo, a trick, I’m sure you know, that Robert Johnson employed to get his idiosyncratic vocal style.
 CM: 	No, I didn’t know that.
 BG:  	Oh, yeah.
 That’s the story, anyway,  He turned away from the engineer in the studio there and faced the corner, like Little Jack Horner—as a matter of fact, I almost called this “Little Jack Horner,” but it didn’t make much sense.
 Anyway, everyone thought the poor guy was just shy, or hiding his idiosyncratic playing style—which may be partly true—but the real reason, so I’ve read, is that he could get an interesting “bounce” from the corner, sort of double-tracking his voice before that was ever heard of.
 So, I laid it down first just on this cassette player—really—and then dumped it to a 16-track, played through a little reverb amp I had at the house.

If I asked about the existence of God, or the origin of the universe, or whether or not Twinkies lasted forever, I would expect you to say ‘maybe’ but not for ‘will your mom leave me alone?’
 Liz – We got sidetracked.
 So I’m not quite sure how she answered.
 Jim – What didja get side-tracked to?
 Liz – Just female troubles, you wouldn’t understand.
 Jim – You mean like…
 Liz - …Could be…
 Jim – Question withdrawn.
 (puts his Groucho glasses back on)
 Liz – What are you doing?

BG: 	Well, you know, Lennon’s “Norwegian Wood?” Yeah, man, that’s about some affair he had, right?
 But, he couldn’t talk about it because of Cynthia.
 So, he writes this piece of surrealistic poetry and he sings it, man, in this voice as old as the shepherds.
 Well, “Hell in Denmark” started that way.
 It’s code, man.
 But, you know, I don’t hide anything from my Love.
 I don’t know, I started out writing this song because I had fucked this chick, see, when I was on tour, when Lor was back here.
 And she sort of followed me around for a couple of gigs, and it was like a lost week, there, I was all screwed up.
 I wasn’t thinking about Lorelei or what this would mean to her, if anything.
 I just wanted to keep balling this chick, right?

When his eyes showed surprise, she told him, "I know I'm naive, Rick, but I'm not totally stupid.
 After all, you stared at me all morning."
 "That's different," he muttered, glancing away.
 "Why?"
 When he didn't answer, she took his hand, lacing her fingers with his.
 "They tried to make a game of picking me up and throwing me into the waves, but I wouldn't let them.
 I didn't let them touch me.
 Not even to help me up."
 She played with a damp, curling lock of his hair.
 "I'm still a woman of the '20s.

Who will they marry one day, how many children will they have, will I be a grandpa or a memory?
 Too many thoughts are packed in my head as I realize this is my life and my family’s life passing before me as the moment of truth approaches.
 Perhaps all this worrying is for nothing or perhaps the worst is about to happen.
 I must cleanse my mind of this sudden bombardment of thoughts and I must focus!
 I pull into the parking lot of the Starbucks just as my crack-berry rings.
 I see Ashley standing inside the coffee shop with her cell phone up to her ear.
 I answer the phone as I notice a space directly facing the front door of Starbucks is opening up as a car begins to back out.
 She asks me where I am and I tell her I am looking at her from in the truck waiting for that front spot to open.
 She sees me, and as we talk I can see her lips move slightly ahead of the sound of her voice.
 I didn’t see the red Dodge Charger anywhere when I was pulling in and I don’t see it now.

Mrs. Campbell was the only teacher who'd taken an active interest in my wellbeing, but I could see his point.
 I managed to do at least a passable job hiding my near frown as I nodded in acceptance.
 "Can I have just a few minutes today after school to tell her?"
 Alec's hand was warm on my face as he nodded.
 "You're amazing.
 All the things being taken away from you just because you got involved with the wrong crowd, and you just do what has to be done.
 Of course you can have a few minutes.
 I'm sorry to make you do this."
 I wanted to tell him it was less than he was doing.
 To say it was the least I could do considering this was all my fault, but the unabashed bliss of having him touch me was overwhelming.

“You can’t change something’s makeup, but you can change the way it appears.
 You can move it, but only if you’re near.
 You can stop someone’s heart, but you can’t make them feel happy about it.” He hesitated after that last part, contemplating, and then continued, “You can manipulate the elements, move water, draw it from the ground, but you cannot easily make it appear from nothing… though one can usually collect moisture from the air.
 Fire is easier.
 It spreads so fast.
 You can pull a small spark from anywhere to create a flame, fueled by the air and…” He trailed off as I leaned closer to him, listening intently.
 Chevelle looked into my eyes, words forgotten.
 I didn’t know what he had seen there, but he blinked, shaking his head.
 “Let’s keep working.” He stepped a few paces away as he spoke.
 “You’ll need to think clearly and stay calm.

 “Behind you, master,” Qurrah said.
 He hurried the words of a spell as Velixar turned.
 An incorporeal hand shot from Qurrah’s own, flying across the battlefield to where an elf dove toward them, arrows flashing two at a time in the starlight.
 The hand struck the elf in the chest, freezing flesh and eviscerating his insides with ice.
 The flying horse banked upward as its master fell limp into the fog.
 “Beautiful, Qurrah,” Velixar said, bloodlust burning in his red eyes.
 His precious undead were being massacred.
 He could feel their numbers dwindling in his mind, now but a third of what his glorious army had been.

She saved my life, and she’s also been teaching me to read.”
 “How did she save your life?” Qurrah asked.
 “Remember a few months back when I came home beaten, bloody, and blue?” he asked.
 “Guards caught me trying to sneak inside Maggie’s Tavern.
 They attacked me, said they were going to arrest me as the Forest Butcher.
 Aurelia stopped them.”
 Qurrah rubbed his chin, lost in thought.
 He glanced at Harruq, a tiny smile forming on his face.
 “May I meet her?”
 Harruq immediately began blubbering.

Based on our past history, it's only a matter of time before one of us runs into the other, and I'm afraid of what my Mustang might do to you when that happens."
 Brandon's voice washed over me like silk, carrying away any desires I might have had to walk all the way home just to prove a point.
 Not trusting my voice, I nodded and took the couple of steps needed to reach his passenger door.
 "I wanted to apologize for what happened earlier today.
 Cassie can be a real jerk sometimes."
 It was too good to be true.
 I almost looked over at him, but I knew I'd lose myself in a pair of soft, gray eyes.
 Brandon seemed to understand that my silence meant I wasn't convinced.
 "You wouldn't believe how relieved I was when you stepped forward and stopped her before things got out of hand."
 My natural pessimism reasserted itself, undaunted by the fact that I could just see Brandon's exquisitely-muscled arm out of the corner of my eye.

Hello earth to Seth,” I repeated.
 No answer again.
 “Seth is there something wrong?” I whispered.
 He didn’t answer me again.
 He continued to stare at the woods as if he expected a flying deer to leap out, wearing pink socks.
 “What the heck Seth, are you deaf now?” I waited for a sign that he heard me to appear on his face, but it remained blank.
 Emily huffed loudly, “Expect something from Jazell and me soon Jason.
 We’re out of here.
 See you around.” She grabbed my hand and pulled me away.
 Seth turned to see me leave and the look gave me a dark feeling inside.

And that was saying a lot.
 He hated having to go to work this morning.
 What if, now that he was trying so hard not to think about anything in 1927, his mind wandered to it?
 He knew he wouldn't be able to bear it if he went home and found that she had disappeared.
 After nearly four hours of trying to concentrate on his work, he gave up and told his secretary that he wasn't feeling well and was going home.
 On his way there, a shop window caught his eye, and he slammed on his brakes, causing the driver behind him to lean on his horn.
 He circled around and dashed into the store.
 Marie had just sat down in front of the TV with a dish of ice cream when she heard the garage door open.
 How odd--why would Rick come home in the middle of the day?
 Remembering how he'd seemed to feel ill yesterday, she set her ice cream down and ran to meet him.

His arms whipped around her.
 "Then don't leave me."
 She looked up at him, her eyes filling with tears.
 "I have to.
 I-I just have to.
 I have to go home."
 They stayed locked in each other's arms, her tears soaking into his shirt, his tears dripping into her hair.
 At last, Rick, feeling weak and shaky, took Marie's hand and led her to the living room.
 They sat down on the sofa, and he drew her close.
 "I love you more than anything in the world," he whispered into her hair.

Chevelle’s furious gaze flicked to my cloak piled on the floor before returning to us.
 Us.
 I was curled in Steed’s lap.
 Chevelle stormed toward us.
 The arm wrapped around my back loosened but Steed’s body didn’t seem to tense.
 His body.
 I giggled a little for no apparent reason and then tried to straighten myself so I wasn’t cuddling with him.
 Chevelle held his arm out and I wondered foggily if he intended to strike one of us, which made me laugh again.
 He shook his head, plainly disapproving, and a flagon landed in his open palm.
 He knelt in front of us.

One by one, the skulls’ fire went out and they fell like morbid hail upon the city.
 “Limitless,” Qurrah said, his smile trembling.
 Blood ran from his nose, and his skin was so pale Harruq could see his veins.
 “The well is limitless.”
 His eyes rolled into his head.
 Without another word, he collapsed.
 He dreamt of fire poured into flesh and a man whose eyes were glass.

 “Qurrah!” Harruq shouted when his brother finally opened his eyes.

“I don’t know Jazell, they aren’t here.
 They’re just gone.” My stomach twisted into a knot.
 We had always been a group of four and now it was just the two of us.
 The ghost girl’s words came back to me.
 The four of you were chosen because of your unbreakable bond, but even that can be broken.
 You are strongest when you are together, but don’t let yourselves be separated.
 Kojas had separated us because he already knew that.
 The girl had warned us for a reason.
 She had known that Kojas was going to try to split us up into groups so that we would be weak.
 I watched Seth pace back and forth, nervously running his fingers through his hair and drumming the hilt of his sword.

Mrs. Alexander was looking down at me, concern etched into her features, and the beginnings of a crowd was starting to form as the rest of the students came over to look at the freak.
 Only something wasn't right.
 They weren't towering enough.
 When you pass out on a regular basis, you get used to finding yourself on the floor surrounded by concerned-looking people, but none of these people were looming properly.
 Everyone else having somehow gotten too short suddenly wasn't as important.
 The room was still swinging around, only now it wasn't moving, I was.
 A pair of muscular arms encircled my tingling waist and legs, holding me tightly to a near rock-hard chest as Alec deftly weaved through the approaching crowd of students.
 I closed my eyes as a wave of heat started at my collarbones and rushed up to the tips of my ears.
 I wanted to throw up, except that would be even more embarrassing than being carried out of class by the most popular boy in school.
 I opened my eyes and found we were already out in the hall.

 The time for questioning is over.

 _Love me, Harruq Tun.

 Amid the haze of red and black, he heard the cries of battle urging him on, offering him a future he had always feared and desired.
 A life of killing and battle.
 A life given to Karak.
 An orcish life.

Drawing the snake close with magic, I took it in my hand, its thin green body writhing over my left palm, the sword grasped in my right.
 The prisoner watched me, almost smug.
 It was a small snake, its white belly confirming it was nonvenomous, its frame no thicker than my pinkie, but it would do.
 I slid the tip of the sword across the skin above the man’s knee, making a narrow incision.
 His expression did change then, giving way to uncertainty.
 I smiled at him as the sword tip rested against his leg.
 In measured movements, I placed the snake on the base of the blade, letting it slide toward its mark.
 I closed my eyes to relax, settle into the snake as I had the bird.
 My knees buckled as I released too much and I had to back off, giving myself just enough to control it.
 As it entered the wound, the tracker gasped and my smile stretched wickedly.

Isaac was the first one through the door, looking particularly 007 in a tux that amazingly enough had the occasional silver thread that matched perfectly with Jessica's dress.
 I looked up from his outfit just in time to see a flash of concern melt away into relief.
 I had just a moment to wonder at the novelty of Isaac showing that much emotion all at one time, and then James stalked through the door in a tux that was so cutting edge, that I wasn't sure if there was anything else like it anywhere in the States.
 The shimmery nature of the fabric combined with an unusually angular, sharp cut to make it different than anything else I'd ever seen.
 I worked my way up from the blindingly-polished black shoes, to the splash of deep red peeking out of his chest pocket, and somewhere along the way decided I loved the tux.
 As amazing as James' and Isaac's tuxes were, I was already looking past them, craning my neck to see down the hall in a vain effort to catch a glimpse of Alec.
 There was no reason for my heart to be pounding away so furiously in my chest, but unlikely or not, my body at least seemed convinced he was going to change his mind and leave me standing here by myself.
 Rachel looked up from her conversation with Jasmin just long enough to give me a reassuring smile, and then I heard the barest whisper of sound.
 I spun around with a speed that gave lie to all of my pathetic attempts to pretend like I hadn't been worried.
 Alec was standing in the doorway, having crossed the distance down the hall faster than I would've believed possible, appearing almost as if by sorcery.

Me of all people in this horrible world.
 He smiled in triumph.
 Seth stared stone faced at Kojas as he slowly walked towards us.
 With every step, Seth’s hand inched closer to his sword.
 Emily cracked her knuckles quietly and held them stiff at her sides.
 Her face was determined, but I saw her eyes flicker.
 Jason flicked out his knives and held them so tightly that his knuckles were white.
 If he gripped any harder, I was afraid he would snap his fingers off.
 And, me?
 I pulled an arrow out faster than you could say oh-my-god-there’s-a-hideous-monster-coming-to-whip-our-butts.

 An elderly man and woman, propping each other up as they ran side by side, refused to turn when Harruq barreled toward them.
 Salvation took the woman’s life, Condemnation the man’s.
 The two bodies collapsed, their lifeless limbs entangled.
 Not far ahead of them, a woman ran in only her shift, a child clutched to her breast.
 “Why do you flee?” Harruq roared when her crying eyes glanced back at him.
 “This life is pain, suffering!
 I’m here to end it, end it all!”
 The woman ran faster and her child cried louder.

The elf released his own arrow, but Qurrah was faster.
 He dove to the side as the arrow clacked against the stone.
 The elf tried batting the bones away, but he was a fool, unaware of the strength guiding them.
 They shattered his bow, crashed into his slender form, and tore flesh and armor.
 “Kill him,” Qurrah said to the bones.
 They swirled in the air above the elf like a tornado, and all at once they plunged downward, deep into his flesh.
 More shouts.
 He turned north and ran deeper into Singhelm.
 He doubted any humans patrolled the area, not after the defeat of their army.
 If he was to find safety, it would be there.

 "You need to come to the party Friday night."
 "You mean the monthly kegger?"
 Brandon shook his head, still flashing the grin that made it almost impossible to remain mad at him.
 "No, the monthly full moon 'kegger' happened last weekend.
 This is just a party to blow off some steam.
 We have them sometimes to celebrate things."
 "Like what?"
 Brandon shook his head as he pulled me back down into my seat.
 "Nope, if you want to find out, you'll have to come to it with me."

What is needed is not another job generation programme, but a change in social values that will accelerate the natural and inevitable evolution of society, from one in which labour is regarded as a dispensable resource to one based on full human rights and the enormous productive potential of the human being.
 The type and magnitude of change needed today is comparable to that embodied in President Roosevelt’s New Deal for the American people during the Great Depression, at a time when 25 per cent of the workforce was unemployed: to the Indian government’s decision to launch the Green Revolution in the mid-1960s to achieve self-sufficiency in foodgrains, at a time when the country was highly dependent on imported food to stave off famine: and to Mikhail Gorbachev’s initiatives late in the 1980s to end the Cold War and transform Soviet society.
 Is Full Employment Possible?
 Few will argue with the compelling logic, justice and idealism of this view, but many will question the feasibility of practically implementing it.
 As long as we continue to believe that society is truly helpless to manage job growth, there will be strong resistance to the full employment goal.
 We must recognize that the present status and functioning of our economies is the result of specific choices that have been made in the past, based on priorities and values that were relevant or dominant at the time, but which we certainly are not obliged to live with indefinitely and, in fact, are continuously in the process of discarding in favour of new values and priorities.
 The rapid adoption of environmentally friendly policies around the world is positive proof of how quickly the rules, even economic rules, can change when there is a concerted will for a breakthrough.
 So too, the welfare policies of the European Union that have resulted in a 70 per cent rise in national income over the past two decades, but only a 9 per cent increase in the number of jobs, were due to conscious choices that favoured the employed over the unemployed, not the inevitability of the market.
 Recent economic debate in the United States has brought this truth to the fore.
 At a time of historically low levels of inflation and high levels of unemployment, the US Federal Reserve has pursued a policy of raising interest rates in order to prevent a potential rise in inflation at some time in the future, which has had the immediate effect of dampening growth and slowing job creation, just at the time unemploy ment rates were beginning to fall towards normal levels.

Eugene – Ummm….
 Cleo – Those teams sound wonderful.
 Liz – It sounds like fun.
 Jim – I guess that means that I’m playing.
 But if you start getting bad we’re putting the board away.
 You in Karen?
 Karen – Sure.
 I haven’t  played Scrabble in years, hope I remember the rules.
 Jim – Well dad is a rules lawyer so he’ll let you know if you step wrong.
 Art – Ok, lets get dinner cleared away so the crushing of your egos can begin.

And it wasn’t just that, but the thistle.
 I needed to see Junnie.
 The door was partially open when I reached Junnie’s house, so I peeked my head in and called for her.
 When she didn’t answer, I slipped in to check the back room.
 As I walked through the sparsely decorated living area, I passed a carved mirror on the wall and noticed something off in my reflection.
 I knew I was flushed, I could feel the frustration and worry, but I stopped to get a closer look.
 There was something not right with my complexion, but what was really off was just above my face.
 I squinted, leaning toward the mirror as my hands reached up of their own accord.
 The first quarter inch of my hair was blackened.
 I parted my hair in a different area and then again, but the base of my hair was dark over my entire scalp.

What milligram size I should say I have?
 Brandon told me that the easiest way to buy pills is from people who are prescribed them for chronic pain and intentionally demand more than they need from their doctors so they can resell them at an enormous profit.
 Brandon told me that the Holy Grail for an Oxy dealer was to find an “old guy with a script” (prescription); so I decided this would be who I would become.
 I went to a Wal-Mart and purchased a pre-paid cellular phone that I would use as my undercover phone.
 I didn’t need my last name popping up on a caller I.D.
 I nicknamed the phone my “crack-berry.” After getting crucial information and doing a bit of research, I found the Craigslist classified advertisement with a picture of a young blond girl offering massages with a contact phone number that matched the drug dealer Steve’s number.
 The pictures in the ad were racy and the price per session was about twice the normal cost for such services.
 I called to set up a “massage.” I told her I got massages often for my ailing back but I thought it would be fun to get a massage from a pretty young lady.
 We scheduled an appointment for later that same day.
 I’ve had back problems in the past, as many 50 year olds do, so I dug up a back support and I wore it to the appointment.

“Maybe we should see what your strong suit is,” she said and motioned me to follow her as she walked to the rock ridge and jumped over, hurrying down to the men.
 “Sorry to interrupt, gentlemen,” she announced.
 “I was wondering if you’d mind a little demonstration?” They broke their circle to give her their attention.
 “Frey here hasn’t found her rhythm yet,” she explained.
 They seemed to understand and she bounded back over to me and drew me to sit beside her on a large rock facing the men before cueing them to begin.
 The largest stepped forward, boasting deep brown hair and eyes.
 He wore plain clothing but his broad shoulders and massive size made him seem regal.
 “They name me Anvil but I am Reed, of Keithar Peak.” His voice was thick, though it was impossible to tell whether it was an accent or he had difficulty speaking.
 He was huge, frighteningly so, but something about him drew me in.
 I wanted to be his friend for no reason I could rationalize.

If you are going into the most dangerous part of the competition to be injured or killed and you have only one or two points, why bother?” Doi’van said.
 “To be honest, I am surprised how many are left.
 There are still quite a few young fools out there.” “So how many are left now?” Rodregas asked.
 “Fifty-four, on my last count,” Doi’van said.
 Rodregas was a little worried about his shield and wondered if he should jump in and rescue it from the powerful grip of the Hellborn, but he held his tongue and let Doi’van handle the equipment.
 “I see you are employing the forces of the Infernal Realm to aid you in the joust,” said a voice behind Rodregas.
 Rodregas unfortunately recognized the voice as that of Ambassador Van’dret even before he turned and saw him standing there.
 Two nervous looking squires were standing behind him, one holding a glass and a bottle of wine.
 The tall graceful Immortalist had dark robes of deepest black with swirling gold patterns sewn on it.
 His hair was pulled back and to the side in an unusual looking style.

Famine attracts media coverage, political and public attention, but chronic hunger does not.
 With global food surpluses accumulating, an organized effort can ensure food security for people everywhere.
 The challenge of achieving food security for all human beings is complex, for it depends on the interaction between multiple factors – technological initiatives to produce sufficient food; economic initiatives to stimulate sufficient employment opportunities and increase purchasing power; political initiatives to maintain a peaceful and stable environment, undisturbed by war or social unrest that can interfere with food distribution; and administrative initiatives to provide for those who are unable to provide for themselves due to poverty or during times of emergency.
 Peace, democracy, employment and food security are mutually interdependent.
 The efforts proposed to promote peace, democracy and employment generation will mitigate the problem of food security to a considerable extent.
 In addition, Chapter Five of the Commission’s report highlights direct interventions that are needed to address the problem at the level of agricultural productivity, among which the following are particularly relevant in the present context:
 Farm Productivity: The attraction of high technology service industries should not blind us to the fact that a large section of humanity still depends on agriculture as its main source of income and livelihood.
 Farm productivity in these countries is typically less than a fourth or fifth the average attained by other countries.
 Low agricultural productivity results in high cost food, low rural incomes and limited employment opportunities, both on farm and in downstream industries.
 As a revolution in agricultural productivity provided the impetus for rapid industrialization in Britain and later USA in the 19th Century, rapid modernization of agricultural technology, a shift to commercial crops, improved linkages for credit, marketing and processing can act as a catalyst for employment generation and economic growth in many developing countries today.

It wasn't until I'd returned Mrs. Alexander's reference book to its shelf and sat down at my desk that I remembered I'd had to do the entire 'group' project by myself.
 Alec hadn't even bothered to come to Physics since the assignment had been given.
 My entire life I'd had people try and sponge off of my work, and I was way beyond sick and tired of it.
 By the time Alec strode into class looking like the inspiration for every romance novel ever written, I was really mad.
 I hardly waited for him to sit down before I pulled my desk a little closer and hissed at him.
 "So very nice of you to come to class on the day our stupid assignment is due."
 Alec's expression was remarkable in that I'd never seen anyone look so full of life while simultaneously failing to betray even the slightest hint of emotion.
 He didn't even open his mouth as he reached into his bag and pulled out a bundle of densely-packed typewritten pages.
 The arrogance of it all.
 He hadn't even bothered to consult with me before typing up an answer that was probably completely off base.

Their noses were flaring, and he had to pull them almost to the opening.
 As soon as they got close they both went charging in; they sensed the barn was shelter to keep them safe from the Dire Cats.
 Like the farmhouse, the barn was also built of the same impressive large cut stone.
 However, while the stone was in great shape, all other materials seemed to have fallen apart.
 There were several small trees and bushes growing in the barn.
 The floor was also stone, and there was not enough dirt and debris for them to grow very large.
 They had to clear a path to get the wagon in.
 Imeralda ran her hand over the stone with a surprisingly gentle caress.
 “It is Nymph stone, right?” Rodregas asked.
 She nodded and said, “Yes, I am half Forest Nymph and half AElf and this is beautiful work.” All Nymphs have a specific attachment to nature such as forest, stone or water.

Human beings are our most creative, productive and precious resource.
 Human capacity increases the more it is drawn upon.
 It can never be exhausted.
 Developing the human resource should be the centrepiece of all development strategy.
 We can solve today’s most pressing problems if we adopt a total approach which takes into account all the interrelated factors – political, economic, technological, social and environmental – rather than relying on partial strategies.
 Partial remedies, however welcome or desirable, can always generate side-effects – such as the increase in social tensions and violence observed when increasing political and social freedom are not matched by increasing economic opportunity, or the rise in unemployment and arms exports that accompany a reduction in defence expenditure.
 The success of the Green Revolution was due to its integration of technological, institutional, commercial and public policy measures, while its short comings arose from its failure to integrate environmental factors, which are now being incorporated in agricultural development strategies.
 Comprehensive measures can eliminate the side-effects of partial progress.
 The progress of the whole depends on the progress of all its parts.
 Humankind is infinitely enriched by the qualitative diversity of culture and individual expression, but it is immeasurably impoverished by the quantitative abyss which separates the more fortunate from the rest of humanity.

“Touch that book and you die,” I hissed.
 He froze, staring me straight in the eyes.
 I was fighting for control, struggling to find my thoughts.
 Then I saw it.
 He flicked a glance at Ruby and I knew.
 They knew.
 And it was all true.
 Suddenly, I couldn’t catch my breath.
 “Please, Freya, stay calm,” Ruby pleaded.
 They were circling me, their arms outstretched as if to catch me… or cage me.

I tapped Cliff and we followed the kid.
 He looked about sixteen.
 His haircut might have come from a Marine base.
 He wore glasses and a smile I interpreted as phony.
 He passed out a Bible tract, a directory of churches, and a card with his name and phone number.
 I thought, call you for what?
 This kid, I believed, had spent more time in church than outside in the real world.
 He hadn’t attended a dozen funerals, known anyone like Eric, read Nietzsche or Dostoyevski.
 Most of all, he wasn’t Billy Graham.
 Besides, I glanced to the right of the kid and saw the babe with auburn curls.

 Dirk hit the ball.
 "Kim who?"
 Rick had to run to get it.
 Dirk missed it.

Qurrah ignored him, knowing he would soon be dead.
 The other guard charged Qurrah and swung his longsword.
 The necromancer smirked, preparing another lashing.
 The flaming leather wrapped around the guard’s sword hand, charring flesh to bone as he screamed.
 The blade dropped as the guard held his blackened hand before him, bits of white bone catching the moonlight.
 “Mercy,” he begged, falling to his knees as the necromancer approached.
 “There is no such thing,” Qurrah said before magically hurling two pieces of bone through the man’s eyes.
 He turned to the other guard, who still gasped in vain for air.
 He watched until death claimed him.

“If you’re gonna fight me, fight me!” he yelled.
 He ignored several strikes, accepting the cuts so he could close the distance between him and his opponent.
 The sound of steel was quick and brutal, but after the humiliation against Dieredon, Harruq felt as if his opponent moved through sand.
 At the end of three seconds, both of his blades had found flesh.
 The guard fell at his feet, bleeding from a severed arm and a gutted belly.
 Soaked in blood, Harruq turned to the remaining guards and bellowed like the mad beast he was.
 The remaining two facing him were trained well.
 They held firm when Harruq charged, and stayed close together.
 Because of this, they managed to survive the initial onslaught.

Before he got help now, he would need to hit rock bottom.
 Hopefully he’d survive it.
 Then, one day Thomas called.
 Brandon just contacted him from some street corner in a bad part of town outside of San Diego.
 Brandon said he was broke, addicted, alone and ready to commit himself to rehab.
 Thomas said he had dropped what he was doing and was driving directly to find him, as he knew Brandon might change his mind.
 Thomas said that most drug addicts would take every drug they could get their hands on if they knew they were going to rehab, and this was dangerous.
 He was off to the rescue!
 Thomas called again when he had Brandon in his car, saying while Brandon looked horrible, he was alive and on his way to a detox center, which would be followed by rehab—hopefully.
 My brother had connections at this rehab center.

Up until the last couple of weeks, he'd almost always been sweet and considerate.
 He had never been unkind to her before they'd become betrothed.
 Of course, both times before when he'd shouted at her, he'd come to her to-- "Marie?"
 Davis called as he tapped on her door.
 "Darling, I'm sorry.
 Please come out for a minute."
 She went to open the door.
 "You hurt my feelings.
 And you hurt my arm."
 "I'm sorry.

The old kitchen drudge was still peeling the same potato when he left the kitchen.
 Freshly fed and feeling better for it, Rodregas went across the main hall and entered the door opposite the kitchen into the barracks section of the keep.
 The place was about as messy as he had ever seen it; the normal tidiness demanded by Captain Poir had apparently been put aside in excitement over the chance to take some time off for the celebration.
 His personal bunk and trunk were a mess.
 His good blanket was missing, as was his spare pair of boots and most of his other belongings.
 Clearly, the rest of the guards had thought him dead and made free with his stuff.
 Rodregas reached into the trunk but all that was left in there were a few bits of trash, a few candle stubs, some scraps of paper and a bit of cloth.
 He reached down and picked up the small piece of cloth and held it up.
 He stared for some time at the design sewn into it, and then stuck it into his outer purse.
 He had a strong urge to clean up his bunk and leave the area in the order it deserved, but that would be too big of a hint of what had happened.

When we stopped for the evening, the men quietly set up a perimeter.
 Except for Chevelle.
 He was watching me as I glared back at him.
 Why had I expected more from him?
 He was my watcher.
 He’d volunteered to help council bind me.
 But it didn’t stop the hostile stare I was sending his way.
 Ruby stepped in front of him.
 “I’ll stay with her.” He didn’t reply; he merely turned from her to walk into the haze.
 I was still fuming when she faced me, wearing a self-satisfied smile.

We swapped out our books and were halfway to Spanish when Vincent and Brandon strode into view.
 Moving so smoothly I was positive that nobody else even realized anything was wrong, Alec swung me around so he was between them and me.
 The tension ratcheted up in step with the rolling waves of energy, as Brandon and Vincent drew nearer.
 They split up when they saw us, casually positioning themselves so Alec couldn't protect me from both of them.
 I felt my knees stop working as I took in Brandon's lazy, confident smile, and Vincent's sick, eager expression, but the gentle pressure of Alec's grasp on my hand kept me from falling down.
 I looked up at Alec, hoping for a reassuring smile, but his face had taken on the expressionless mask he used to guard his thoughts.
 I tried to slow down, but Alec kept moving forward, never altering his speed in the slightest as he pulled me directly towards Vincent.
 It seemed incredible that the few other people still in the hall couldn't feel the surge of energy as Vincent stepped directly in front of us and placed his hand on Alec's chest.
 The sudden spike was enough to make my hair stand on end, but Jim Hansen hurried by without any indication there was something out of the ordinary.
 "You're in our way, half-breed."

They stayed locked in each other's arms, her tears soaking into his shirt, his tears dripping into her hair.
 At last, Rick, feeling weak and shaky, took Marie's hand and led her to the living room.
 They sat down on the sofa, and he drew her close.
 "I love you more than anything in the world," he whispered into her hair.
 "I love you too.
 But Rick--" "I understand.
 But I don't know how I'm going to bear it."
 They were quiet for several minutes.
 Playing with Rick's fingers, Marie tried to grasp what was happening.
 She was going home.

"I just made you spill yours, it's only fair."
 Brandon nodded at Britney, who stood there with her mouth slightly open, as he walked away.
 After a second or two of both of us staring blankly after Brandon, Britney grabbed me by the hand, the one holding the new, unopened water bottle, and pulled me over to a table in the corner.
 "Oh my gosh, you just poured water all over Brandon Worthingfield the Third.
 And then he talked to you.
 This is so incredible."
 I more or less fell into my seat, staring at my new bottle of water as Britney's chatter poured over me.
 It was pointless to try and pay attention to anything she was saying.
 It was all I could do to remember to nod when she paused and looked at me expectantly.
 Lunch passed all too quickly.

After rehab when his head was clear, and he knew how close he came to dying or going to prison, I think he respected what the police were doing.
 By then, several more of his friends had died from an OD or were in rehab or prison.
 We chatted and the officers said that they called Brandon the “one percent kid” due to his progress through recovery.
 They also joked about how I was still the talk of the narcotics and uniform officers as this crazy father who went undercover to save his son’s ass.
 It was an odd gathering but I know the officers enjoyed it and I know they appreciated that their efforts had a positive result on someone.
 While we had Brandon home for this brief time we also attended a family wedding.
 The four of us, Brandon, Bryce, Lisa and myself, drove together several hours north to a coastal town in northern California.
 We all stayed in the same quaint roadside motel near a popular camping spot called Patrick’s Point.
 It was woodsy and cool and we shared a two-bedroom unit with a common kitchen and a family room with a fireplace.
 It wasn’t much but it was everything to my wife and me.

 My world is full of playing with electricity while trying not to get electrocuted.
 But for you, I’ll do my best and try to be helpful.

 Not necessarily in that order.
 See you later Jim.

With global food surpluses accumulating, an organized effort can ensure food security for people everywhere.
 The challenge of achieving food security for all human beings is complex, for it depends on the interaction between multiple factors – technological initiatives to produce sufficient food; economic initiatives to stimulate sufficient employment opportunities and increase purchasing power; political initiatives to maintain a peaceful and stable environment, undisturbed by war or social unrest that can interfere with food distribution; and administrative initiatives to provide for those who are unable to provide for themselves due to poverty or during times of emergency.
 Peace, democracy, employment and food security are mutually interdependent.
 The efforts proposed to promote peace, democracy and employment generation will mitigate the problem of food security to a considerable extent.
 In addition, Chapter Five of the Commission’s report highlights direct interventions that are needed to address the problem at the level of agricultural productivity, among which the following are particularly relevant in the present context:
 Farm Productivity: The attraction of high technology service industries should not blind us to the fact that a large section of humanity still depends on agriculture as its main source of income and livelihood.
 Farm productivity in these countries is typically less than a fourth or fifth the average attained by other countries.
 Low agricultural productivity results in high cost food, low rural incomes and limited employment opportunities, both on farm and in downstream industries.
 As a revolution in agricultural productivity provided the impetus for rapid industrialization in Britain and later USA in the 19th Century, rapid modernization of agricultural technology, a shift to commercial crops, improved linkages for credit, marketing and processing can act as a catalyst for employment generation and economic growth in many developing countries today.
 As some countries have already proven, high productivity does not necessarily require large tracks of land or high levels of mechanization, but it does require quality inputs, adoption of advanced cultivation practices, efforts to improve the productivity of water, access to credit, infrastructure for storage, producer-oriented marketing and industries for processing.

My ears heard nothing and I didn’t see any movement but my hands shook slightly as I typed, Nothing, I’m fine.
 I didn’t open his reply because I knew what it would say.
 I already knew that it was strangely quiet.
 Maybe I could stay home and sleep one night.
 Or maybe I could finish a painting tonight and watch Mom do origami.
 I turned the corner, and my house came into view.
 I started to climb the hill when I froze.
 Out of my left eye I saw the outline of a creature.
 It was heading through the woods in the direction of my house.
 I swore under my breath and took off for the woods.

Not just for the pretty faces or figures, but for their gentler natures.
 Aside from my father and son, I can’t think of a man I have adored except Eric Curtis.
 Love?
 The heart of the Shema, Deuteronomy 6:5, commands Israel to: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.” Jesus agrees, in Matthew 22: "’Teacher,’ a disciple asks,  ‘which is the greatest commandment in the Law?’ Jesus replies: 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.
 This is the first and greatest commandment.’” The word "love" has dozens of meanings, and the one that rings truest to me involves action and will rather than feeling.
 In M. Scott Peck’s definition, "Love is the willingness to sacrifice for the sake of someone else's spiritual growth."
 Since God hardly needs spiritual growth, let’s define loving God as the willingness to sacrifice when God calls us to.
 And at the very least, he calls us to obey his commandments.
 Meaning we face yet another problem.
 In churches that preach seeking relationship rather than religion, we're told that lacking a relationship with God, we’ll have at best a heck of a time trying to obey.

Life couldn't get much better than this.
 Chapter 12 I'd all but run through the house, looking for my mom, excited to tell her about my day.
 Instead I'd been greeted by nothing but half-filled boxes and silence.
 I didn't really want to unpack, but it was long past needing to be done and I knew if I left it to Mom that we'd never really get moved in.
 If I'd had anything even remotely better to do with my Friday night, I would have done it.
 I didn't, so I started with the stuff that we'd piled in the living room because it was marginally cooler downstairs.
 I got into a decent rhythm, opening boxes, pulling out the stuff that I could easily put away, and then consolidating what was left into fewer boxes.
 I was on my fourth box when it happened.
 Mom's jewelry box had somehow got packed into a box labeled 'old photography gear'.
 As I pulled it out to set it to one side, it slipped from my hands.

The bushes and trees rattled and then the woods were silent.
 I could hear everyone's heavy breaths as we turned to face each other.
 Well, actually everyone turned to me.
 “So,” I said and wiped the sweat off my knife's handle, “that was something, wasn't it?” Emily put her hands on her hips.
 “Jazell, how the heck did you know how to kill those things?” She shook her head.
 “What were those things?” “Syphons,” I said.
 “I don't know how I knew where to stab them.
 I just did, alright?
 It was weird.” Seth shook his head and leaned against a tree.
 “How come you get some random power when the rest of us don't?” He gave me a fake pout.

"In your wave oven?"
 "Microwave oven."
 He smiled.
 "It depends on what you want."
 He made them a salad and put two frozen lasagna dinners in the microwave.
 It wasn't the best lunch he could offer a guest from the 1920s, but it was the only thing he could think of to prepare in the microwave.
 Marie seemed fascinated by it.
 "Lasagna in ten minutes.
 Incredible."
 She touched a forkful to her tongue, finding that it was too hot.

I watched Britney's little white Saturn disappear down the lane with a complex set of feelings that included a bit of loneliness and more than a little relief.
 After a minute or two spent staring off into space, I finally decided the discomfort in my stomach was sharp enough to justify the effort of eating.
 Given the ridiculous heat, studying was the last thing I wanted to do, but there wasn't really anything else to do so I changed into cooler clothes and made the best of it.
 Three hours later my brain felt like it was going to run out of my nose, so I wandered upstairs.
 It was still too hot for comfort in my room, but unpacking in the heat was better than facing the math problems waiting for me downstairs.
 We'd partially unpacked things to get my bedspread out, so everything else went pretty quickly.
 My room wasn't particularly large, but someone had put a long shelf around the top of the room, and the closet had more storage space than my room back home.
 My meager belongings quickly found new homes.
 I looked one last time at the box holding my clothes, and then sighed and shoved it under the bed.
 My unpacking was all done, which meant I had to go back to my homework.

“Of course, but let’s get something just a bit more hardy in you and maybe we can move you around a bit.
 Your body has sat still too long.
 Then, you will take a nap.
 “When you awake I will get you Imeralda.
 Doi’van is doing better than you, but I don’t think he is up to doing any visiting yet.” Rodregas nodded in relief at his words and soon enough he was once again sleeping.
 The next day, sometime around midmorning judging from the light coming in through the opening that seemed to function like a window, Imeralda entered along with a young handsome Nymph.
 He was tall with green hair and with a confident bearing to his presence.
 He greeted Rodregas with a very bright smile.
 “I see that you are looking much better,” said the unknown Nymph.
 Imeralda gave the young Nymph a big hug, one that looked far more intimate than Rodregas was comfortable with and she said, “Rodregas, we are so lucky that I was able to get Jordaan to come.

He turned the weapon over in his hands, marveling at the swimming colors of dark green and black.
 He paused when he found a name written in gold near the hilt.
 “Tun’del,” Harruq read aloud, slowly and carefully.
 “He even has his name on his sword.”
 “Did I not say he was arrogant?”
 Harruq stared at the name on the scabbard, mesmerized by the beauty of the writing.
 He ran his fingers over it, enjoying the feeling of pure gold.
 When he covered the second half, he paused.
 “Qurrah,” Harruq said.
 “Look at this.”

This was a convenient way to pass a joint around the room without ever leaving your chair.
 The clip swung from smoker to smoker.
 I got up and went to school early the next day, and then my daily routine would repeat itself.
 Somehow I willed myself to stick it out at school despite my surroundings and the influences of my peers.
 I don’t know what it was that enabled me to do this, to not fall entirely into the wasteland of addiction and entitlement.
 Biology?
 Character?
 It’s inexplicable, really.
 All of my roommates had dropped out of high school but somehow I continued; although my grades sucked, they were passing grades.
 In my senior year I only took classes until noon because that is all I needed to graduate.

As winter approached, we sat by the fireplace and took turns reading out loud.
 We admired Russell’s smug attitude, the gall of a fellow who accused Christ of utter arrogance for counting people vipers simply because they disapproved of his preaching.
 We delighted in Russell's arguments that Christianity was the principal enemy of moral progress in the world.
 Dismiss Christ, trust ourselves, we would discover the solution.
 Simple.
 After a couple of Russell’s books, Eric brought home Thus Spoke Zarathustra, by Friedrich Nietzsche, a strangely enchanting poet.
 Zarathustra claimed that some of us could become supermen.
 First, our spirits would need to brave the desert like camels, forsaking our past, our heritage, all the values of common people.
 Once we had finished forsaking, we would metamorphose into lions and proceed to slay the dragon called "Thou Shalt".
 After burying the dragon, the lion would die and resurrect as a child, the infant superman, innocent and forgiving, a new beginning, a sacred Yes.

He wasn’t smiling, his face unreadable.
 “I am an old friend of Junnie.
 I saw her at Council this morning.
 She was disappointed she has been too occupied by clan business of late to guide you.
 I offered to help her.
 To help you.” The stranger I had been obsessed with was going to help me with my studies.
 I melted, sliding down into my chair.
 He was still holding his hand out to me.
 My back pressed against the wall, and as he took a step forward I became wholly aware of how small and isolated the library space I had chosen was.
 He turned the outstretched hand palm up, indicating the stool beside me, as if that had been his intention all along.

It seemed like it was just too much for all of us to take in.
 All of a sudden Seth spoke up.
 “Why are you wearing sun-tanning penguin pajamas, Emily?” Emily glared at him, “What do you have against penguins?
 And why can’t I wear pajamas?
 It’s the middle of the night you know.” Seth wasn’t bothered by her glare.
 “So it wouldn’t have been hard to change.” Seth should have realized that he was pushing Emily’s limited patience too far and that he should shut up.
 She reached down and grabbed a small stick.
 Then she smacked Seth across the head with it.
 “Live with it Seth.” Emily said every word apart and wacked him again.
 Seth made a small, “Ow.” Every time she hit him.

“You’re the one who comes up with plans.” Emily paced back and forth, trying to think.
 Where were Seth and Jazell?
 Were they okay?
 More importantly, where were they?
 “I don’t know,” she said finally.
 “I just don’t know.” “Oh no,” Jason said nervously.
 “When Emily doesn’t know, the world ends.
 Do you wish now that you were at home, curled up with a book?” “Yes.” *** “Seth,” I said, “calm down and think.
 We can’t stay here forever, and pace.”Seth didn’t stop and he started mumbling under his breath.
 I walked up and pushed him around.

When, after a few seconds, he didn't end the kiss, her heartbeat sped up.
 He'd never kissed her this long before.
 But her eyes flew open when she felt his hand slide under her skirt to squeeze her thigh.
 Panicking, she tried to push him away.
 But he pinned her against the back of the sofa, his mouth becoming rough.
 She tried to break away from him because he was kissing her so hard that her teeth were cutting into her lips; she could taste the blood.
 But he wouldn't let her go.
 And then he pushed his tongue into her mouth, and shock and disgust fused with the pain to give her the strength to shove him away.
 Marie could only stare at him as she raised trembling fingers to her bruised and bleeding lips.
 Davis was breathing hard.

They left us in the field and all we knew to do was to walk back the way we came.
 We hitchhiked to the airport and stood outside where the planes were de-boarding.
 We hustled an unsuspecting tourist into buying our surfboards so we could return to California.
 I collect-called my mother from Waikiki once we knew what flight we would be on and she was surprised to hear my voice since we hadn’t talked in months.
 She picked us up at the airport and I think her head almost turned in a circle when she saw us.
 Our hair was down to the middle of our backs and we were as dark as natives.
 It was crazy times then.
 Chapter 9: Times They Are a Changing Back in Sacramento, freebasing and disco were big.
 Before long, one of my roommates was busted with an abundance of cocaine and I narrowly missed the arrest.
 I was literally driving away from the house and saw cop cars coming down the street toward it.

 Guard captain Antonil marched through the street, leading fifty of his men marching in perfect union.
 His face was a portrait of stoic calm, but it was all a lie.
 His heart was troubled and he had not a soul to tell why.
 He held a proclamation of King Vaelor to the entire nation of Neldar.
 He had argued as best he could, but his words meant little.
 When Antonil asked that someone else deliver the proclamation, a frown had crossed the king’s smooth face and he had slammed his lotioned hand against a table.
 “It will mean more coming from you!” the king had shouted.
 “They will know the seriousness of my order.

The only thing of use in the water closet was a shaving kit which Rodregas added to the trunk.
 Next he went to the study door only to find it locked.
 He looked for a key but there was nothing.
 He guessed that it was locked by magic and required a magic word or incantation to open the lock.
 He pushed and pulled on the door, but it was solidly made and there was nothing to get a good hold of to test his new strength.
 He looked around for something to use as a pry bar; next to the fireplace was a poker.
 He grabbed it and forced it into the crack were a normal door would have its catch.
 He got it wedged in good but then stopped and went over to the outside door and opening it, listened for anyone nearby before going back inside the room.
 He carefully closed the door behind him; the sound of him breaking down the study door would ring loud in the predawn silence, but his need for money was too great.
 What he had found would be worth some good coin but finding a trader that would give him its worth would take time.

Rodregas would like to have tried to take on one of the Immortal Guards, but he had already noticed that the slaver with the mace was a little too close and a little too far away from his nearest companion.
 He was a skinny man with dirty hair and seemed to be having trouble holding his heavy weapon.
 Rodregas stepped in close and the slaver swung the mace with surprising force, but he met it with the shield and knocked it aside.
 Rodregas moved with simply too much speed to be blocked.
 He slid the short sword into the slaver’s stomach and gutted him in a quick and vicious move.
 Doi’van immediately launched himself at the next slaver, and followed suit, slamming his opponent’s sword away and gutting him before he had a chance to move.
 Rodregas then went for the nearest Immortal Guard.
 Once again he followed up with the same move, stepping forward and slamming his shield forward to either knock his opponent’s weapon or knock the guard himself down.
 Unfortunately, when Rodregas hit this guard he matched his every move for move.
 The guard responded, slamming shield against shield.

The smell of real food was consuming, and I was watching the cooked meat roll over the flame as I moved again.
 A dry leaf crushed beneath my foot.
 “Come then, there’s plenty for both of us,” the figure called.
 I cursed.
 Caught, I walked cautiously out of the trees.
 He turned, tossing the cloak aside as he propped one leg onto a rock.
 I had the strangest notion he was posing.
 He scrutinized me, and I resisted the urge to straighten my hair and brush the dirt from my clothes.
 “Don’t be shy.” The stranger beckoned, gesturing to an upturned log beside the fire.
 The meat sizzled and popped as I crossed to him and sat obediently.

That wasn't the kind of person who'd take advantage of my human weakness to seduce me.
 In fact, it was all too likely he was going to fight my every effort to bring us closer together precisely because he didn't want to take advantage of me.
 I was suddenly very certain though that I was going to wage that war.
 I couldn't not want him, not love him, any more than he could do less than his best to keep his family from harm.
 Chapter 28 Alec was completely drenched in sweat, and I still wanted to throw myself at him so badly my teeth hurt.
 It shouldn't be possible for someone to look so good dressed in what amounted to little more than loose, extra-stretchy sweatpants.
 "How was training?"
 It was hard to sound casual.
 The urge to kiss him had become almost overpowering in the last few days.
 He knew me better on every level imaginable than anyone outside my immediate family ever had, and all I could think about right now was how much I wanted to touch him.

I am safe but I still can’t call my wife because I am wired and those were part of my many instructions.
 I wait silently by myself wondering if this bust will count for my son or whether there was even a bust at all.
 Over thirty minutes of silence passes and Officer White pulls up and I ready myself because I now have a million questions.
 As he gets out of his car, I begin to blurt out my questions and he tells me he must disconnect the wire before we can talk.
 I reach for my waist and pull the wire off before he can help me.
 I hold it out to him, he takes it from me and turns it off, and he says, “We got them.” I am so relieved but that is only one answer to one question and I have many.
 The deal was done and I was so relieved that it was over.
 I then called my wife who was so wound up from the lack of communication over such a long period of time.
 She sobbed uncontrollably as I told her I was unharmed, headed home, the ordeal was over and we busted the drug dealers.
 A hero’s welcome awaited me, as my son was so thankful for what I had done for him.

It is in this context that the European Union, the United States and other Western governments have been considering ambitious proposals for addressing this issue.
 The Australian government has unveiled a $4.6 billion jobs package to reduce unemployment from 10 per cent to 5 per cent by the end of the decade by encouraging training for the young, the unskilled and the long-term unemployed.
 Recently the OECD has presented the main planks of an employment strategy to stimulate economic growth in the industrial nations, make labour markets more flexible, increase productivity, and revamp employment and unemployment security provisions.
 The relative success of the US economy in creating jobs during the past decade has prompted other countries to emphasize the importance of policies to increase the flexibility of wage rates and bring down the price of labour by reductions in the statutory minimum wage.
 The main effect of this policy is likely to be a movement of jobs between nations, however, not a significant increase in the total number of jobs available.
 In fact, measures which reduce wage incomes could have the perverse effect of reducing aggregate purchasing power and employment.
 Economic growth is recognized as an essential, though not sufficient, condition for higher rates of job growth – but fears of inflation constrain industrial countries from trying to stimulate faster expansion of their economies.
 The primary impact of moderate levels of inflation would be to encourage an outflow of investment to more stable currencies.
 How ever, if the industrial nations all agreed to relax their monetary policies, this effect could be minimized.
 The real constraint on job creation in the industrial nations is not the price of labour, but the need for increased capital investment, partly to counter the effects of reduced military spending and the drastic fall in output and demand in Eastern Europe.

He was my watcher and I was missing.
 So where else would he be going?
 Before I had, regrettably, torched the documents, I had seen Junnie noted as his contact.
 My pulse sped at the idea that he might be going to her, to get her help in finding me.
 If he was my watcher, I’d be his responsibility, and she was the only one who knew me at all aside from Fannie.
 He was a good fifty yards farther as I considered.
 My feet were moving before I’d actually decided to follow him.
 My determination faltered.
 How far should I go?
 What if he wasn’t going to find Junnie?

Only after he saw her eyes make a decision, did he slide his hands down her body and cup the small of her back and pull her into a kiss, but this time he let more of his passion and need show.
 With his kiss her resistance evaporated and she went from hesitant to eager.
 Her hands started pulling at his leather armor, eager to get him naked and feel his skin.
 At her action Rodregas felt awkward.
 This was not really his body that she wanted to touch; he was not really this young handsome man that she felt attracted to.
 He wanted to pull away, but did not let himself.
 He had initiated the intimacy, and it would not be fair of him to pull away because of his personal doubts.
 “Easy,” Rodregas said, “I want to go nice and slow and enjoy every step.” They kissed again, this time eagerly exploring each other’s mouth and lips.
 He ran his lips down the line of her chin.
 Though he was trying to go slowly, they quickly found themselves naked.

I wrote the songs, I played those hot licks, I sang the fucking songs, right?
 You can dig that.
 It’s not ego, man, it’s just what was.
 That’s what’s so sad about Crafty—I mean, what would he be doing if I hadn’t formed Black Lung?
 He’d be fucking pumping gas, man, he’d be dealing.
 He’d be selling Krystals.
 Because he ain’t that smart.
 But, yeah, we were cracking up even as we rose.
 Maybe rising causes dissolution, right, you can dig that.
 Like Icarus.

Eugene – Hey, that’s a good idea, I would never have thought of using a name of a mythological monster.
 Thanks Liz.
 Jim – Most of those names aren’t well known, and the people who do know them would die of laughter rather than of fear.
 Liz – Use a modern monster name then, like King Kong or Dracula or something.
 Eugene – Hey great!
 I know, Godzilla.
 It’s perfect.
 GODZILLA!
 Jim – Godzilla is just a guy in a dinosaur costume.
 You’d do about as well taking the name Barney.

Then I realized what Ruby had said and I wondered if my brain would ever be quick enough to keep up.
 “Guests?” He hesitated before answering.
 “We will be traveling with some friends.” He was so vague.
 A formless irritation started to crawl its way to the surface, but I had to remember I had no right to ask.
 These were my captors.
 My fingernails cut into the palm of my hand where the map had been.
 We’d be traveling to the peak, they’d said.
 I couldn’t guess what waited there, but that didn’t stop the hope that it was something of my mother, my family.
 But even if it wasn’t, I’d be that much farther away from the village and council.
 The second bit of Ruby’s parting comment registered, so I excused myself to her room with a yawn and a short good night.

“Or maybe it’ll be terrible.
 All I know is, it’ll make getting expelled and the rest look like kid stuff.” The next day, Saturday, according to Sylvia, he spent reading Heart of Darkness for the second straight time.
 On breaks from the story, he returned to his winnowing.
 He loaded a garbage can with old board games and school papers and gave a couple of pairs of jeans to a neighbor boy.
 He even tossed out the charred and bent pan he used to make popcorn since he had grown tall enough to reach the stovetop.
 That evening, when I called to ask if he wanted to go to the cut-rate movies or shoot pool with Billy and me, he was probably home.
 But Sylvia had gone out with Richard, and nobody answered the phone.
 Billy spent the night at my place.
 We had plans for the next day.
 Billy and I, Eric, and Kenny were going to drive up the coast to Laguna Beach, for the annual sidewalk art festival.

As many lords only allowed swords to be for their soldiers and nobility.
 Farmers and crafts people were not allowed to own edged weapons of war.
 Though Rodregas had known such rules to be broken by non-noble families, it was done discretely, usually for keeping a family heirloom.
 During the fairs that most rural areas had fighting contests were common, but they were always matches of wrestling or bare knuckle fighting.
 The only weapons allowed the local workers were the staff and sometimes the bow.
 Rodregas had always regarded the staff as a primitive weapon which no true warrior would bother with, but to watch Doi’van with it was breathtaking.
 The staff whirled around him a blur, and the length of the weapon made full use of his height and size.
 But he also had complete control of the weapon as he highlighted that morning by whizzing past Rodregas’ clumsy blocks and bruising every part of his body until even the smallest movement hurt.
 Rodregas was used to being better trained than others, but with the staff he was starting from scratch; even holding it properly was new to him.
 Doi’van showed him to keep one hand at the center of the staff and one hand between the center and the end.

And no, disregard for the consequences of my actions isn't typical.
 In fact I've spent nearly a decade weighing almost every word."
 "So dashing off to rescue an admittedly stupid teenage girl and landing yourself in a fight to the death that you probably can't win isn't how you normally run your life.
 Why did you do it then?"
 Again the silence, but this time, more completely enveloped as I was by the tingly warmth that seemed synonymous with being in his presence, I was content to wait.
 "Apparently Isaac's decided there are a few things you should know.
 Don't try and tell me it wasn't him, you didn't know that particular piece of information an hour ago, and nobody else has had the opportunity to tell secrets."
 I felt myself tense up in worry, but he waved my worries away.
 "In answer to the core of your question, Jasmin thinks it's because I've finally gone over the edge, that in essence I've snapped due to the stress, and this, 'obsession,' as she terms it, is merely a novel way of committing suicide."
 My heart started racing again, but he wasn't done.

It jerked and coiled free of the wound, flicking blood over the tracker’s pristine white robe.
 Behind me, a low voice ordered, “Kill him.” I glanced down at the sword, still in my hand.
 The sword I was supposed to take someone’s head off with.
 I didn’t know who the order had been intended for, but it wasn’t me.
 This man was going to die.
 I knew he didn’t have more than a moment before their magic broke him.
 They would take his life because he was after us.
 After me.
 I didn’t hesitate, just pulled my arm up and swung hard, backhand.
 The blade cut clean and his head rolled backward, hitting the ground with a sickening thud.

“Which explains so much.”
 Murmuring a few words, he smashed his hands together.
 Fire burst to life in the center of the stones.
 Harruq grabbed a small pot and brought it to the fire, but Qurrah stopped him.
 “There is no need,” he said.
 “How come?” Harruq asked.
 Qurrah narrowed his eyes and stared at the meat in his hands.
 “I have something I wish to try.”
 The bigger half-orc stepped back, willing to watch his brother work.
 While Harruq was skilled in swords and had all the muscle, Qurrah possessed far more interesting talents.

That captured my imagination, I guess, and I was sitting in the garden drinking tea and thinking about you, imagining what you were like and what your life must have been like before your marriage.
 And then-and then you walked into my garden.” “Incredible.”  She stared up at him.
 “But how?
 I mean, how did that .
 .
 .
 open the door or whatever?
 Had you ever done that before?” “No.”  He shrugged.
 “I was really lonely and falling in love with a girl in a book.
 Maybe God decided to take mercy on me.” “Oh, Rick.”  Her eyes filled with tears.

First she loaded the dishwasher while Rick supervised, and she poured in the soap and started the machine herself.
 After a shower, she had lessons on the use of the food processor, the blender, and--delight of delights--the microwave oven.
 "I can make lunch now," she proclaimed happily.
 "Do you like to cook?"
 "Yes."
 But her face fell.
 "To be honest, I don't know how.
 We have a cook.
 But I'd like to try."
 "OK.

So outside of things.
 I was floundering.
 I was lost.
 Only Lor knows this.
 I went into seclusion, I hid from the world, man.
 And, really, I think, that was the end of Black Lung.
 My black period, my darkest days.
 Lor and I rented a cabin up on the White River and we just hid away.
 I didn’t write a fucking thing, didn’t even read the newspapers.
 I don’t mean to imply that I could have done something, that I had any more power than the Pope or The Beatles or, you know, fucking McNamara.

Then a girl passed along a rumor that Liz Pence wanted to go out with me.
 Liz was a beauty.
 We dated a few times before the prom, and she would've preferred that I give Karen notice and take her instead.
 But I was neither that cold-blooded nor that stuck on Liz.
 She might be as pretty, but if she possessed any goodness like what I saw in Karen, she hid it deep.
 Prom night, for reasons more complicated than I can remember so long, Cliff was driving a '49 Ford convertible that belonged to Bob Williams, whom I will visit in Portland a few days from now.
 Cliff's date was Chris Latin.
 Karen and I rode in the back seat.
 Karen had a cold.
 Maybe her reason for keeping her distance, physical and otherwise, was hygienic concern for my health.

“You’ll need to think clearly and stay calm.
 The best fighters are the best thinkers.” “Fighters?” I asked, confused.
 He shook his head again, as if clearing it.
 There was a long pause as I waited for his answer.
 “I’d like you to practice just for protection.” “I have fire.” He picked up a fallen branch, long and jagged, and snapped the smaller twigs from its side.
 “Yes, but you should learn to think more openly.
 It is an important resource and should be familiar to you.
 You should have years of experience by now.” “Why don’t I?” He stopped.
 I could tell by his expression he hadn’t meant to say so.
 “Why can’t I use magic?” I clarified.

And it's because of Rick that I know."
 "Rick?
 That's your friend's name?"
 "Yes.
 Mother, he's wonderful.
 We were attracted to each other almost immediately, but the first two times he tried to kiss me, I pulled away.
 And he let me.
 He even apologized the first time.
 And when I did let him kiss me, he said he'd rather die than ever hurt me."
 Mrs. Tranton reached out to play with a lock of her daughter's hair.

I don’t want to fight you.”
 “I didn’t want you to fight either,” Harruq said, his eyes leaving hers for an instant.
 He took a step toward her and raised his swords, just as when they sparred.
 “Stop this,” Aurelia said.
 Her staff remained at her side.
 “Will you kill me, too?”
 “I asked you not to fight, but here you are.
 Qurrah made it simple, Aurry.
 Either I love you or I kill you.”
 Sparks rained down as he clanged his swords together.

I had so many questions I still wanted answered, but it didn't seem fair to get Isaac in any more trouble than he was already in.
 "Will you be okay?
 I mean with Alec.
 He's not going to torture you or anything for telling me, is he?"
 Isaac's smile somehow completed his face.
 Funny how I'd never thought there was anything wrong with it before, but after finally being rewarded with something more than his normal, serious countenance, I had the first hint why he was one of Rachel's favorites among the pack.
 "It's likely I'll be exceedingly sore for the next few days, and my ego, such as it is, will likely take quite the beating, but our Kir'shan, our Alpha as you would say, isn't a bad sort."
 That was a relief.
 It also meant I knew exactly what I was going to do when I saw Alec next.
 Half an hour later, I was following him down the hall towards Physics and wishing I'd had more time to prepare.

Forgive me for hoping you could trust me.”
 The vines released, freeing the half-orc who smacked against the ground.
 By the time he picked himself up, the vines had pulled into the dirt.
 “I have something new planned for tomorrow,” she said.
 “Don’t be late.”
 “You’re going to pay for that,” he grumbled, rubbing his sore wrists after she was gone.
 His heart was not in it, though.
 More than anything, he was embarrassed and frightened about losing control.

I walked up and pushed him around.
 “Seth, you have to think.
 Kojas did this on purpose, he’s trying to weaken us by splitting us up.
 He wants us to go running to him.” “I know what he’s trying to do, it’s driving me crazy.
 The nerve of this guy.” “Faery,” I corrected him.
 “He’s not a ‘guy’, he’s some demon faery.
 Calling him ‘guy’ makes it sound like he’s just a normal human.” “Does it matter right now?” he asked, through clenched teeth.
 I looked away.
 “I guess not.” “We should move,” he said.
 “I want to find out where we are and where the others are.

“That you will die last,” Qurrah said before casting his first spell.
 The fire in the center of the camp flickered and then died.
 The half-orcs, through their mixed blood, could see well in the darkness.
 The humans had no such natural ability.
 Until their eyes adjusted to the moonlight, the only thing they could see was their burning red eyes, the demonic glow of Harruq’s blades, and the fire that burned but did not consume Qurrah’s whip.
 In that darkness, they were demons of another plane, furious and merciless.
 The men fought but their hearts were afraid.
 Qurrah could sense it and knew the battle was already theirs.
 Harruq bellowed a battle cry, clanging his swords together for effect.
 The guards gathered as best they could, forming a wall in front of the noble.

Her hand formed the wildlife, and to tend her creation she created elves.
 The goddess gave them long life and abundant land so quarrels within their race were of the petty sort.
 Then the brother gods came.
 Ashhur of Justice, Karak of Order.
 There are many worlds beyond our own, Qurrah.
 I have seen fleeting glimpses of them in my dreams.
 Karak and Ashhur came from one of those worlds, and Celestia welcomed them.
 To them she gave the grasslands and rolling hills.
 “These brother gods did not make their own creation.
 Instead, they made man, much the same as man existed in their former world.

She slid the false wall back in place and grabbed my arm again, our heavy cloaks moving like shadows as we ran from the village.
 We didn’t go far before she stopped and jerked me into a squat beside her.
 There was movement a brief distance ahead, a rabbit weaving from the cover of one rock to the next.
 As I watched, a stick shot from the ground and speared the animal through the chest, killing it instantly.
 I gasped.
 Ruby giggled at me.
 She grabbed her quarry and we rushed back to the house.
 We went to the main room and she started a fire as she easily skinned and gutted the animal.
 The entrails went into an urn beside the fire and I wondered what she used them for before remembering all the containers on her bedroom shelf with a shudder.
 She stretched the pelt to dry while the meat cooked.

 Eugene – Which would you choose?
 Jim – (to Eugene) Which would you choose?
 Eugene – I already chose life.

But he hadn’t the heart to destroy his crop.
 He simply left.” I felt the tug in my chest at her story, but Ruby’s eyes were dry and clear.
 I wondered how many times she’d told it.
 “I hear he wanders the mountain.
 Probably killing fairies.” Ruby laughed again.
 This time it sounded like genuine humor.
 The tension in the room eased a bit.
 “Ruby.” Chevelle’s tone was respectful as he turned from the window.
 “They’re here?” she asked.
 He nodded and she rose gracefully from her seat.

It was what we were made for.
 What other purpose do you see for your life?”
 Harruq shrugged.
 “I said it before.
 I’m here to protect you.”
 “Then kill those that seek to kill me,” Qurrah said, a bit of his sleepiness leaving him.
 “Our master has given us so much.
 Power.
 Weapons.
 A purpose.

Isaac, James and Jasmin were trying to track down the worst of the lot, the ones who'd taken an active part in Brandon's atrocities, but it was slow going.
 Part of the job had been resolved when Cassie and two other wolves had tried to circle around and attack the estate.
 Luckily Isaac and the others had stumbled onto them.
 The fight had been brief and bloody.
 None of our guys had escaped unharmed, but they were all going to make a full recovery, and the same couldn't be said for Cassie or the others.
 I shivered a little at the thought, and Alec looked up with concern on his face.
 "Do you need another blanket?"
 "No, I'm fine, just a little worried about Jasmin and the boys."
 Now he did frown.
 He wasn't excited that he had to stay here instead of leading the tracking group.

 Johnny – It drove her nuts that you would spend so much time reading “that filth”.
 Jim – Mom didn’t need much to get her going.
 Johnny – No she didn’t.
 Jim – No.
 Johnny – (after a pause) Jim?
 Jim – Yeah?
 Johnny – What do you think happened to her?
 Jim – What do you mean?
 Johnny – I mean to make he do all of that.

I started to pull away from the guard but he didn’t release me.
 I realized then I hadn’t been dismissed.
 It had been a direction for the guard.
 He wrenched me beside him, jerking unnecessarily, and then shoved me through the door to my room.
 I listened, but his steps did not recede.
 I tried the door; it was already bound.
 I threw myself onto the bed.
 I felt absolutely wretched.
 Actually, I felt worse than that.
 I felt as if I’d been poisoned.

Smiling smugly, he turned to leave, but not before I could grab at the sleeve of his sport coat.
 "Wait.
 Who is it?
 Who's helping us?"
 The smirk hadn't left.
 "No, he was very clear on that point.
 You're not to know.
 That's the one thing guaranteed to make him go through with his threats.
 You'll just have to be satisfied with the fact that you'll both continue to be able to live in our fine city."
 Normally I would have just acquiesced, but I couldn't bear the thought of letting him leave, taking with him the identity of the only person besides my mom who really cared what happened to me.

The requirements of the state and the market must eventually give way to the needs of people.
 The values of authority and money must be supplanted by acceptance of the fundamental value of the human being.
 Human welfare and well-being must become the central determinants of social policy, in place of the compulsions of the centrally controlled state bureaucracy and the decentralized market pricing mechanism.
 The first essential step in that direction is a commitment by market economies to guarantee the right of every citizen to employment.
 Neither the mechanism of state planning and control nor the mechanism of market prices can accomplish this on their own.
 A blending of their values and methods – freed from the blinkers of dogma and the determinism of limited imagination – can lead us to the answer.
 Wider Perspective on Transitions
 The outcome of all great social transformations – of which the present instance ranks in magnitude and importance with that of the French Revolution and the movement which freed India and so many other former colonies from imperialism, economic exploitation and cultural domination – depends on the degree to which individuals and institutions within the society have been prepared to understand, accept and respond to the new environment ushered in by the transition.
 Two hundred years ago the people of France were ready to overthrow the old order but ill-prepared to create anything new, with the result that the old soon re-established itself and lived on for another century.
 It took India’s leaders more than four decades to prepare their people for freedom and it has taken another four to overcome the vestiges of colonial rule that prevented the country from releasing its energies for prosperity.

He had sworn his entire life to them.
 What else did he know?
 What else could he be?
 He thought of Aurelia only once before he spoke.
 Her face was a white knife in the darkness of his mind, and he buried her deep within his heart as he yielded to the wisdom of his brother.
 “Yeah,” Harruq said.
 “I understand.”
 “Good.
 Now come.” The two resumed traveling up the small hill.
 They stopped again, however, for from their vantage point they could see the village.

Especially since it was pretty obvious that he himself had something to gain by convincing her that she shouldn’t marry Davis.
 His sister had once told him that a girl usually wouldn’t even believe her best friend if she told her that her boyfriend was cheating on her.
 He went back to his office and read the article again.
 He should have shown it to Marie before he’d fallen in love with her.
 But he was afraid to tell her he’d known of her before she’d walked into the garden.
 What if she thought he’d done something to cause it?
 Marie was growing increasingly frustrated with the books she was reading.
 There were all kinds of theories about how to travel through time, but there was absolutely nothing that could explain how she’d traveled through time.
 She hadn’t gotten in a time machine, hadn’t been near a dead star, hadn’t been thinking about 2011.
 That was another thing—most of the articles talked about traveling back in time, not forward.

Ruby sat beside him, a warm smile on her face as if we were old friends.
 Chevelle was near a window on the front wall, leaning on one shoulder, his body turned toward me, expression impossible to read.
 “Better?” Ruby asked.
 “Yes, thank you.” I was polite, but it burned a little to thank her after what she’d done.
 Steed smiled, shaking his head from side to side with exaggerated slowness.
 “Some night.” He looked like he was trying to keep a secret.
 Heat crawled up my neck as I remembered climbing into his lap, and then again the second time I’d gotten out of bed.
 Ruby grinned at him conspiratorially.
 “Yes, so educational.” Had I talked in my sleep?
 Could this get any worse?

Without establishing a stable climate of peace, human rights cannot be safeguarded, democratic institutions cannot function effectively, prosperity cannot flourish, and human beings cannot discover their higher capacities for external achievement and inner fulfilment.
 Peace is imperative for a thriving democracy.
 A comprehensive perspective and integrated approach to these inter-related issues can lead to a major breakthrough on multiple fronts.
 We are poised at what can become a turning point in the role of war in human affairs.
 The momentous consequences at stake call for decisive action.
 Historically, war has been a means of territorial expansion and economic conquest that strengthened and enriched the conqueror while draining the energy and diminishing the wealth of the conquered.
 War and economic development co-existed and sometimes complemented each other.
 Technological progress increased defensive and offensive capabilities.
 The demands of war and the associated destruction stimulated greater economic activity and spurred organizational innovation, especially for the benefit of those not directly engaged in the conflict.
 Guns were one of the first products of mass production.

We said our goodbyes to our sobbing grandmother and to all our friends and entered a new chapter in our lives.
 I was in the fifth grade; Thomas was in sixth.
 Chapter 5: Connections My disposable cell phone rings and it is Ashley.
 She tries to get me to change my location and meet her at her apartment across town.
 “I am waiting where I fucking told you I would wait.
 I am not moving anywhere,” I hissed into the crack-berry—my nickname for the phone.
 The thought of walking into some apartment and getting clunked over the head for drugs is not an option.
 This is the second time Steve and Ashley are supposed to meet me for this buy, and the last time they decided not to show after I wasted hours listening to their phone calls buying more time or trying to get me to drive somewhere else.
 “I have no intention of moving anywhere, so get your shit together or this deal is off.” I tell her this is her last chance to get the Oxy and I will be waiting in the spot I told her.
 “Hurry up, or I will sell the drugs to someone else, just like I did the last time you flaked!” I push the end call button on this cheap pre-paid cell phone that I purchased just to do this deal and I toss it onto the console of the truck.

"Lovely, lovely."
 It was a large sapphire encircled by tiny diamonds.
 "I pay you a rather generous salary, eh?"
 "You're very generous indeed, sir.
 And Marie deserves the best."
 "Are you referring to the ring or yourself?
 No, no--just a joke, son."
 He returned the box to Davis.
 "My permission is a foregone conclusion.
 I'd dismiss you from the company if you didn't marry her."

“Well, we also have elven blood in us.
 Our mum said she bedded an elf before she was thrown out of town.
 So guess what?
 I’m thinking we’re the children you sired with that orc lady so many years ago.”
 The glow of the spirit faded.
 It looked back and forth, shaking and moaning.
 “You cannot be bastard children of mine,” Ahrqur said, his voice weak and distant.
 “Celestia cannot hate me so.”
 “Celestia has nothing to do with this,” Qurrah said.
 “It is truth.”

I thought about asking for more details, but it felt wrong, like reading someone else's e-mail.
 Besides, I was pretty sure Rachel would tell me it was Jasmin's story, and I'd just have to go to her with my questions.
 The music picked up slightly, and Jasmin and Alec sped up with it.
 They were moving so quickly now it almost seemed they were better than Isaac and Jessica.
 A quick visual search laid that question to rest though.
 I could just make out Isaac's towering form across the pavilion in the corner where they'd apparently gone to find room for some of their more impressive moves.
 It seemed amazing to me that they were willing to move so quickly around normal, uninformed humans, but apparently they figured professional dancers were at least as quick.
 I shook my head and turned back to Rachel, only to feel my throat constrict as I saw Britney.
 Not only was she wearing a tight, black dress that made her look at least twice as hot as me, she also happened to be draped across Brandon's arm.
 I was so caught up watching Britney that it took me several seconds to notice the differences in her date.

I started to grab my phone but stopped.
 I didn’t need to tell the others, it was just one.
 And if I was lucky, it would be an easy take down.
 I closed my eyes and began my mental countdown.
 The wind picked up around me, as if a wind current had just appeared out of nowhere.
 5… My body started to feel hot, like I was being hugged by the sun.
 I hated this part.
 4… Power surged through me as I was freed from my human self.
 Shivers ran down my spine.
 3… I felt cold, like being dipped in ice water.

As we trailed the other students out of the class, I wasn't so sure I was equally enthused.
 Nobody had said anything to either of us.
 It was starting to look like Britney was receiving just as much of a cold shoulder as I was.
 And she'd been here an entire year.
 It was bad enough not fitting in because you preferred your own company over that of your peers.
 It sucked a lot more when you didn't have a choice.
 I tried to amuse myself by people-watching with the half of my mind that wasn't paying attention to Britney's chatter as we went back to our lockers.
 We passed one of those gorgeous, skinny redheads who always look good without looking like they spent much time in front of the mirror, then Britney exchanged smiles with a couple of artificial blondes.
 I'd seen the type before in Minnesota, girls who have a perfectly acceptable figure, but who throw money into their wardrobes, makeovers and accessories in an effort to achieve the cutting-edge look, when they'd be much better off just picking outfits that didn't try to compete with the anorexic-looking beauty queens.
 A surprisingly adorable-looking nerd in jeans and a tee-shirt ducked out of our way, and I felt a pang of sympathy.

He will usher in a new age to this world.
 Of this I have no doubt.” He shouted an order to Qurrah’s undead.
 The eight obeyed, marching out of town to join the rest of Velixar’s army.
 “I will take control now,” he said to his disciple.
 “In time, the burden of sustaining life in them will seem weightless.
 Until then, let me bear it.
 Look at me.”
 Qurrah did, his eyes red and his face wet.
 “Yes master?” he asked.
 No weakness tainted his voice.

He’s a softie at times, and this is one of them times.”
 Aurelia smoothed his hair in her fingers, frowned, and then sliced off a large chunk with the incredibly sharp dagger.
 Brown hair fell in clumps at Harruq’s feet.
 “You’re going to leave me some up there, right?” he asked.
 “Don’t make me cut your ears,” Aurelia warned.
 Harruq began his story.
 He told her of a gift from his brother, a tiny sword Qurrah had whittled from bone.
 A bully had stolen it, but then Qurrah used a dead rat under his control to steal it back while they slept.
 The haircut and the story ended at the same time.
 Dirty hair was strewn over the grass.

 "What do you think about a September wedding, Mother?"
 Marie asked as they had lunch alone together Friday.
 Mrs. Tranton looked up in surprise.

 "No, of course not--you know that I would have come screaming to you right away."
 She smiled at her mother over her teacup.
 "Then why are you considering a September wedding?"
 "I think he'll propose soon.

If the death is fresh, the power should still linger.”
 Harruq reached out, grabbed his brother’s wrist, and clasped his hands in his.
 “I won’t like it,” he said.
 “But I’ll do it for you.”
 “We are better than them,” Qurrah said, standing so he could look through the cracks of the boards across the broken door.
 “Stronger.
 Life is for those who take it.
 I need you to understand this, brother.
 Together, we can become something great.”
 “Like what?” Harruq asked.

My mother insisted that Thomas’s last rehab stint at Narconon had worked for Thomas and she knew he had strong ties there and perhaps he could get Brandon in for treatment.
 She told us that Thomas was doing work for the rehab in the form of interventions and getting drug addicts into treatment and that was what Brandon needed.
 But at what price?
 I wasn’t as worried about the financial price at this point, but rather the thought of owing Thomas after all that he had perpetrated against us was almost as unpalatable as Brandon’s Oxy addiction.
 This was all unchartered territory.
 It was all uncomfortable.
 It all sucked big time.
 My pride would take a back seat to Brandon’s needs.
 His drug problem was more important than the grudge I was holding over my brother’s drug-induced antics.
 I felt like I was selling out.

Emily listened quietly but when I got to the part that we were supposed to go there, her mouth fell open.
 “That’s completely crazy!” Emily gasped.
 “We’re supposed to just leave and go there?
 What about our parents?” “He told me, and I quote, ‘Miss did you not think that her majesty would have this all planned out?
 You don’t have to worry.’ I personally think it’s all a little skeptical, don’t you?” “Yes,” she said, digging for a pencil and paper from my bag, “I do.
 We don’t even know who this ‘majesty’ is and if this information is reliable.
 I understand the Half-way part, that makes sense, but the destiny part doesn’t.” I sighed and sat down on the log.
 “The dwarf said to meet him tomorrow morning near ‘the thorn that reaches the sky.’ What does that mean anyway?” Jason stepped over and spoke instead of Emily, who was furiously writing everything down, as if she’d forget in a couple of seconds, “It could be a description of something in town, maybe a building or a landmark.” I suddenly got an idea and took another piece of paper out.
 “Hey Jason maybe you could draw what you think it might be and that would help us.” “I’ll try my best, Jazell,” he said.
 I knew that his drawing would probably help us.

Any amount of ridicule would be worthwhile if it meant being able to stay with Alec.
 He obviously still wasn't convinced though.
 "Adri, you don't understand.
 This is the only way to keep you safe.
 I can't protect you here.
 I can't even protect my own family."
 He was still trying to disengage my arms from around his neck, but it was obvious he didn't want to hurt me, and I was holding on with everything I had.
 "No, you don't understand.
 This whole time I thought I was in love with Brandon, I didn't even know him.
 You did so much for us and didn't even hate me when I was so rude.

And there was the real rub.
 Alec was well on his way to being fully healed, while I still had fits of dizziness every time I tried to stand.
 I even had to have Jasmin or Dom help me to the bathroom.
 There was no good way to know how long I'd lain there with a branch stuck through my back, but it'd been long enough for even a relatively small wound to result in near fatal blood loss.
 I'd been nearly unconscious from the pain, so I didn't remember any of what had happened next, but Alec had reluctantly filled in most of the details.
 Apparently the stress of the fight had finally awakened his potential, and his power was a real humdinger.
 The metaphysical hurricane that'd knocked me to the ground had actually been Alec pulling power from all of the shape shifters and humans in the area.
 The experience had been nearly as overwhelming for Alec as it had been for the rest of us.
 He'd recovered just in time to find Brandon grimly pulling himself along on all fours.
 Luckily Alec had recovered more quickly, and once Brandon was deprived of the strength and speed his power had bestowed upon him, Alec had been more than a match for him, even wounded and exhausted.

You’ve been there?
 Ok, it’s ground zero, as far as I’m concerned.
 I’m just a student of that place, of Larry, right?
 I’m still learning.
 Anyway, we all went to McClure’s for coffee and sat around the whole fucking afternoon talking about anything and everything.
 Dylan, you know, he was in, what they were calling a down phase—like they fucking know—and we talked about that, and about how I was being called a sell-out.
 And, I remember, Ferlinghetti said this wonderful thing, he said, “You know what Durrell says, Buddy?
 ‘In the end everything will be true of everybody.’  And, man, I thought, yeah, that’s salvation, that’s true.
 I tried to capture that in the song.
 I probably missed the mark—you had to be there (laughs)—but I tried, you know?

 If anyone complains feel free to suggest that they don't leave it until the last minute next time."
 There was plenty of grumbling when I announced that the lab was over, but nobody actually said anything.
 Rachel was waiting for me at the door as everyone else filed out.
 She looked up guiltily as I made my way over to her.
 "Did you have a good day?
 I haven't seen that many people here ever."
 If there was one thing that'd always pissed me off, it was people who refused to own up to their mistakes.
 In my mind not being where you said you were going to be, especially after being so jazzed about it previously, fit into that category.

"I can't do it, Dad.
 Missy Jeffrys already did the entire assignment before we even got out of class, and I can't even figure out one problem.
 I'm not good enough; I'm never good enough."
 Rough fingers had appeared from outside my peripheral vision, gently smoothing away tears.
 "Come on honey, you really can't expect to do everything by yourself.
 Let's take a break for dinner, and then I'll help you."
 He'd forestalled my next excuse as if reading my mind.
 "There isn't anything wrong with letting someone help you.
 Sometimes a helping hand is exactly what's called for."
 The memory had a vividness that'd been lacking lately.

She'd had several of the heart-to-heart talks with her mother that she'd longed for.
 She should be happier than she had ever been in her life.
 But she wasn't.
 She was more miserable than she had ever been in her life.
 All she could think about was Rick.
 As hard as it was to admit, she missed him more than she'd missed her family.
 When she'd walked into 2011, she'd been frightened out of her mind.
 It had been so fantastic, so strange and sudden.
 She’d needed to make everything right, to make her life .

A footstep fell beside his head.
 His heart and lungs halted.
 The pain had diminished his skills.
 They were atop him, but he dared not move.
 He sent a silent prayer to Celestia as more footfalls clomped all around him.
 He guessed at least ten.
 Soft clacking sounds of bone, swinging metal, and crushed grass erased the silence of the night.
 Dieredon’s heart resumed.
 His breathing continued, slow and steady.
 He fought down a laugh, despite all his training.

From her expression she meant what she said, but Rodregas did not think she was happy to say it.
 Doi’van just looked at Rodregas for a moment with a thoughtful expression; he was clearly thinking it out carefully.
 “I am not sorry for my actions last night,” he said.
 “We did what we thought was right.
 You appeared to be an Immortalist Sorcerer and I have grown to hate the Immortalists.
 When it became clear that you were not, I stopped trying to kill you.” He paused at this, and then Rodregas could tell he made a decision.
 “You have given me a sword, if a small one, and among my people that is a powerful gesture.
 I will not lie to you, I have left my old life behind and the last few years I have learned to truly hate the Immortalists.
 I travel with you only because the others were going to go back to their homes, and I have no home to go back to,” he seemed to finish, but then added, “Last night you pointed out that the forces of the Immortalists would be after you and you would fight them.
 And you also proved that you can fight.” Once again he paused.

Eugene – I did manage to make some cash, so it’s not a complete loss.
 Jim – You didn’t rob them did you?
 That’ll cause one helluva international incident.
 Eugene – No, I didn’t steal anything.

 Eugene – I posed for pictures.

A single elf approached.
 He was dressed in a long green cloak, silvery armor, and he bore his bow openly.
 Antonil could barely make out his features, since he was so far down the street.
 The elf halted, drew an arrow, and fired it into the air.
 It smacked the dirt an inch from Antonil’s foot.
 Sergan shook his head and stared in wonder at his commander.
 The man had not flinched.
 “I shall take that as your answer,” Antonil shouted to the town.
 “Woodhaven desires death.”
 He drew his sword and spoke softly.

He'd had his house built on a beautiful acre that was located on the southeast edge of the area inhabited by Boston's elite.
 Real estate prices there were outrageous, but Rick, with his connections and eye for property, had gotten this parcel for next to nothing.
 It was only a few blocks from the downtown area and considered too close for comfort by true members of the upper class.
 But for Rick it was perfect.
 Both his office and his neighbors were close but not too close, and he had a beautiful lawn in the front and a large patio and flower garden in the back.
 Rick smiled as he walked into his kitchen, loosening his tie.
 Lauri moaned every time she walked into the garden.
 What a waste, she always sighed, looking at him with reproach.
 A woman would love having that garden, but what did a man know about flowers?
 Truthfully, he knew very little, Rick mused as he set his cartons of Chinese on the counter and went to change clothes.

Then he began thinking about planes, remembering his trip with Marie to Los Angeles.
 Then he thought about all the computer programs he used and how to troubleshoot them.
 He'd just started listing microwave products in his mind when Marie returned.
 He rose and went to hug her.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart," he said, immediately kicking himself for his hypocrisy.
 She sighed, letting herself be comforted by his embrace.
 August was just around the corner now, and she and her mother normally spent August at Cape Cod.
 Her father joined them on weekends.
 They wouldn't go there this year—not with her still missing.
 She'd been gone five weeks now.

“Nice PJs Emily.” I chuckled.
 She stuck her tongue out, “What do you have against sun-tanning penguins?” “Nothing!” I smiled to myself.
 I shouldn’t be talking; I was wearing pajamas covered in little pigs.
 Emily leaned back to turn off her desk light.
 It clicked off and I gazed outside one more time before turning around to go to bed.
 “Night Emily.” I yawned.
 Emily didn’t reply because her face was pushed up against the window.
 Her body was ridged and she didn’t move.
 I crawled over to the window.
 “What is it, Em?” I whispered, a nervous feeling creeping into my stomach.

He hugged her.
 "Thank you.
 Thank you for giving up everything to be with me.
 I love you with all my heart, Marie, and I promise you that I'll make sure you never regret your decision."
 Tears slid down Marie's cheeks.
 She was finally home.

"Listen, I don't mean to be rude, but I've got to finish up my physics homework.
 Can we catch up during lunch?"
 Britney looked a little crestfallen, but her eyes quickly lit back up, and before I could get my notebook out and start writing, she'd already switched seats to one closer to a gaggle of cheerleaders.
 It was amazing that I hadn't made the connection between light, the fact that light acted like a wave, and the rainbows on the parking lot puddles, but it was all making sense now.
 By the time the bell finally rang to release the circus back into the halls, I'd finished up a reasonable outline, and was feeling pretty smart.
 Alec probably expected me to have been totally stumped, but I'd figured out the exact answer to the assignment, and I was so going to show him.
 The glow of satisfaction more than made up for the fact that Britney chattered non-stop on our way to Algebra.
 I felt like I should feel guilty for not liking her, but I was starting to notice how much of her conversation revolved around nasty gossip that made everyone else in the school sound like rejects or sluts.
 When we finally made it to Mrs. Campbell's class, I slid into my seat with a sigh of relief.
 This was the one class all day where I could virtually guarantee I wouldn't be talking to anyone.

That was nearly a deal breaker, I could see it by the way his initial smile at my 'rolled eyes' faded away into his more characteristic seriousness.
 He contemplated his response for a good fifteen seconds, which was probably something like two hours in shape shifter time, before finally touching his pen to the paper again and then passing my notebook back.
 It's a deal.
 When I finish up with my questions, you can ask whatever you want.
 Of course if your question is something that's going to get you into trouble, I reserve the right to pack you onto a plane and send you off to safety once I'm done answering.
 I stuck my tongue out at him, for real this time, as I wrote down my response.
 Bully.
 Still, all in all it was a win for me.
 Once he'd dug up every painful moment from my childhood, I was going to get to finally start learning about him.
 His pack too of course, but most importantly, I'd finally know more of what made Alec Graves tick.

Chevelle walked me to the edge of a tall peak.
 The rock mountain ended in a sheer cliff, straight down into haze.
 He looked into my eyes like he saw something there, like he really knew me.
 We gazed out over the cliff, at the horizon… endless.
 I felt his hand on my back and closed my eyes, relaxing into the comfortable, familiar feel of it.
 He pushed me with full force.
 I flew off the cliff, falling straight down.
 I stared back at him as he stood, watching me fall, nothing but open sky above and below.
 I couldn’t imagine why he’d throw me from the cliff, couldn’t think of the magic to stop myself, couldn’t see when I would crash into the base, the rocks below.
 My arms flailed as I jerked awake.

“No, Jason we’re both jumping for joy, but it’s so deep down that instead we both look like we want to slug you,” I said sarcastically.
 Jason sighed, “Okay, you would say something like that.
 I thought in a mood like this you would be less…annoying.” As soon as he finished his sentence, I wacked him as hard as I could.
 Seth showed up after that, placed his bag on the ground, leaned on the statue next to me, and didn’t say a word.
 We all stood there waiting for the dwarf to show up.
 Right as I was about to give up and say we had the wrong place, he appeared.
 Jason saw his blurry outline first and signaled us to enter the Half-way.
 The wind whirled around me, and I walked over to the dwarf with the others.
 The dwarf was breathing heavily, trying to catch his breath.
 All four of us stood there waiting and when he got his breath back, he spoke.

Rodregas nodded.
 The pain was easier to manage knowing that at least he was still in the running for the tournament championship.
 Imeralda stepped into his sight shaking her head, “You men are crazy sometimes; you actually look pleased!
 If your armor had not held you would be dead now.
 And it is not like you are fighting someone who deserves to die.
 Most of these men are honorable warriors.” Rodregas nodded.
 “True, hopefully another day of this though and we will be back to fighting those we should be fighting, and it will be far harder to stop me if I achieve a greater sigil.” Imeralda crouched down, she had a very serious expression on her face, and Rodregas had a sense that he was not going to like what she said next.
 “Rodregas,” she said slowly, “we are not doing this for vanity right?” Rodregas nodded, he sensed she knew the answer to the question but was going somewhere with the question.
 She looked around to make sure others in the arena could not overhear.
 “We attacked a slave caravan simply because there were children and innocents that needed rescuing though the odds were against us.” Rodregas nodded again.

He tilted her chin up to look at her anxiously.
 "Did I hurt you?
 What did--" "No, no--you didn't hurt me."
 She caressed his cheek.
 "But what if you did?
 What if you kissed me so hard that-that my teeth cut my lips?
 What if--" "I would never, ever hurt you."
 He caressed her hair.
 "If I ever do anything that hurts you or that you don't like, tell me, and I'll stop.
 Right away.

He'd apologize, and explain how he'd wanted to stop Cassie, but he'd been too stunned by what she was doing.
 Even the delusional part of my brain that was trying to come up with a way to be rescued couldn't create a plausible scenario from there on.
 The look he'd given me at the end hadn't been that kind of shocked gaze.
 Cassie's threat was too vivid.
 Instead of curling up on the ground where I'd fallen, I pulled myself back up and continued to stumble along in the direction I thought would eventually get me back to the road.
 The washed-out landscape mocked me as I realized just how alone I was.
 Rachel didn't like me anymore, she'd never forgive me.
 I'd managed to alienate everyone from Alec's group, and now Brandon had tossed me aside like so much trash.
 It was too much.
 I collapsed onto all fours, hardly noticing the burning pain from my damaged palms, and let the racking sobs take over.

Swathes of silk gave the open-air building an ethereal feel, while candles and other light sources created a soft illumination.
 I didn't have to possess preternatural hearing to catch whispers about the city having received a very large, very anonymous donation just a few days before.
 The committee had obviously chosen to spend it on decorations.
 My newfound height put me closer to Alec's ear.
 I only had to tug on his arm a little bit to get him down to where I could whisper to him.
 "That was you, wasn't it?"
 "What if it was?"
 "It's too much.
 I mean it's really nice, incredibly gorgeous in fact, but it must have cost you a fortune."
 Alec shrugged.

“Now will you let me down?”
 For a moment, she said nothing, catching her breath and doing her best to calm the flood of adrenaline that still rushed through her.
 Harruq twisted against the vines, but they still held firm.
 Blood continued to trickle down his chin.
 “I’m not blind,” she said, suddenly looking away.
 “Not stupid, either.
 I don’t know why I’m here.
 Lie to me if you must, just don’t expect me to believe it.
 Forgive me for hoping you could trust me.”
 The vines released, freeing the half-orc who smacked against the ground.

He wore a silk shirt and drove a fast, red convertible.
 Though he claimed to have gotten out of prison only yesterday, he blazed at about twice the speed limit down Highways 19 and 41 into Florida and all the way to Miami.
 He talked about money, women, and other stuff he’d missed while in prison.
 When he asked if we would be looking for work in Miami and we said probably, he nodded and chucked my arm.
 “Hey, the boss will set you up.” The boss lived in a palace on a canal.
 He was a midget who needed a wheelchair, but whose live-in babe was about twice his height and half his age.
 She reminded me of the barmaid in New Orleans.
 I was mourning the loss of that dream when the midget said, “You guys from San Diego, must’ve driven a boat now and then.” Bob said he had driven a couple speedboats.
 “Sure you did,” the midget said.
 “Johnny’ll get you the boat.

At the same time the system provides investment and depreciation incentives that encourage indus try to shift from labour-intensive to capital-intensive modes of production.
 Much of the shift from labour to capital might not be economically justified were it not for the in-built bias in this system.
 Low levels of taxation on the depletion of non-renewable energy resources in the United States is another distorting influence that makes machine-driven activity more cost-effective than it would otherwise be.
 5.Analyse job impact of government policies: Almost every government policy has a direct or indirect impact on employment.
 Often the relationship is not recognized or intended.
 An analysis of the impact of major public policies on employment at the local, state and nation level can result in avoidance or removal of significant legislative and administrative roadblocks to job growth.
 Require employment assessment of new policy initiatives prior to adoption.
 6.Re-orient social security programmes toward re-employment: OECD countries spend 2-3 per cent of GDP on labour market policies, most of it to support the unemployed.
 The United Kingdom spends nearly $14,000 a year on every unemployed person.
 The United States spends three times as much on welfare payments as it does on retraining the unemployed.

Then her friend joins us.
 She too is small, attractive and friendly.
 I’ll call her Sweet (since Sweety or Sweetheart might sound demeaning).
 She too attended George Fox.
 Our talk drifts from the varieties of modern Quakers to the benefits and hazards of churches in general.
 That last topic becomes the lead-in to her story.
 No sooner has she begun the telling, than Curly wanders off.
 Later I'll notice her on a couch close by, reading a book, or maybe pretending while she keeps watch over her friend, who no doubt is considered wacky by many, for reasons her story will clarify.
 A few years ago, she began to feel that something evil was inside her.
 “It wasn’t demonic,” she assures me.

how could she give up everything she'd ever known?
 Rick handed Marie his handkerchief.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart.
 I'm sorry that you feel torn.
 But I have to tell you that I'd give anything in this world to have you stay here with me.
 I love you so much."
 Fresh tears rolled down her cheeks, and she laid her head on his shoulder.
 She dabbed at her tears with Rick's handkerchief, noticing that it smelled like his cologne.
 She was going to keep it and take it back with her.
 She'd remember every kiss they'd ever shared whenever she smelled it.

Alec let go of my hand with an actual look of regret.
 Mrs. Tiggs seemed to have read whatever memo Mrs. Sorenson had been working off of earlier.
 She started out the hour by asking me a question I was positive wasn't in any of the chapters I'd ever read.
 The class' collective mouth dropped in astonishment as Dominic called her on it.
 "But Mrs. Tiggs, isn't that covered in Chapter 18?
 I mean, I just started the class obviously, but it just seems confusing.
 Your syllabus says we're talking about the preterit today."
 The only other person I'd ever met who could've even come close to pulling off such an innocent expression was Rachel, and I wasn't sure even she could compete with Dominic today.
 If I'd found her standing in front of a broken window with a rock in her hand, and she'd told me she had no idea why the window had shattered, all the while flashing me that look, I would've believed her.
 Mrs. Tiggs apparently wasn't quite so gullible.

Nothing else of interest was in the wardrobe.
 Though the two fanciest robes both heavily embroidered and of Western Silk, also went to the bed.
 Next, he went to the trunk which was made of High Cedar wood and which matched the large wardrobe, but was much more portable.
 Unfortunately, the only items of use in it were several blankets of good quality wool.
 The remaining contents consisted of drawings, pictures and other personal items.
 Rodregas dumped the trunk contents on the floor, sandwiched the armor in the blankets and loaded up the trunk.
 How he was going to cart the trunk out of the tower he did not yet know.
 He went to the door and listened; it seemed to be getting quieter.
 It was the middle of the night and the stir from the ceremony seemed to have subsided, but it was only hours until dawn when everyone would be heading out to celebrate the new ‘birth’ of Ravenhurr.
 Not a true celebration for most; as their lord and master, ‘he’ was more feared than loved.

try to seduce her?
 He loved her and desperately wanted to make love to her, and her response to him was passionate and unrestrained.
 But she was confused--he knew that.
 And he knew that she was a virgin.
 He'd felt her initial hesitation when he'd tried to coax her lips apart, felt the shock go through her body when his tongue had touched hers.
 The fact that she'd found the kiss exciting didn't change the fact that she was an innocent.
 Or that she was far from home.
 Or that she was engaged to another man.
 He had no qualms about wooing her away from her fiancé, but how could she be anything but confused when she couldn't even talk to the man?
 Heavy-hearted, he finally got to his feet.

Her breasts seemed, particularly, to invite me, to suckle there, to be born again.
 Do you want me to continue?
 You want the rest here?
 Lor?
 LE: 	Tell the truth, sweet.
 CM: 	Sure.
 Um, yes, continue.
 If it’s too private—you decide.
 We can always edit later.
 I’m, uh, intrigued.

When he pulled it up he saw that it was a helmet, a solid Mithril skullcap with sides of chain mail designed to be connected at the bottom.
 He reached up and pulled it on his head, but even his head was too large for the AElfin style Mithril armor.
 It quickly joined the suit of armor and the candleholder on the bed.
 On the bottom shelf he found a nice pair of boots, not of AElven make.
 Attached were matching grieves, armor designed to protect the lower leg., and a pair of armored gauntlets to compete the set.
 All ended up on the bed.
 Nothing else of interest was in the wardrobe.
 Though the two fanciest robes both heavily embroidered and of Western Silk, also went to the bed.
 Next, he went to the trunk which was made of High Cedar wood and which matched the large wardrobe, but was much more portable.

In fact, he wasn't buckled in either.
 "Isn't that a bit hypocritical?
 I mean you tell her to buckle up, but you're not buckled up yourself."
 Alec shrugged.
 "Yes, I suppose it does look hypocritical at that.
 Let's just say Rachel would be missed if we hit another car, but nobody would need to miss me."
 The answer was like something you'd expect from a politician.
 It conveyed absolutely no information, and his supreme confidence was infuriating.
 Luckily, I wouldn't have to hold my tongue for very long.
 We were already gliding around the last bend in the road before our lane.

It presents a set of real opportunities that can be tapped, provided that we take best advantage of the present situation.
 The progress it heralds is no more inconceivable and remarkable than the chain of recent achievements seemed seven years ago – yet those we have already come to take for granted and, underinsistent prodding by the media, to replace in our consciousness with ever new concerns.
 PROSPECTS FOR THE YEAR 2005
 According to the provisions of international treaty, the final batch of nuclear weapons has been destroyed, ushering in a world free of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
 Global military spending has fallen by nearly 50 per cent since 1994 to $400 billion per annum (in 1990 US dollars), half of which is now contributed to a global military force responsible for enforcing a total ban on war between nations.
 Not a single inter-state or civil war is raging due to the extension of the UN's mandate to prevent all forms of war and its vastly strengthened military capabilities.
 International drug trafficking has declined by more than 80 per cent since the signing of the UN declaration granting the UN special powers to eradicate the drugs trade.
 An accelerated schedule for dismantling trade barriers and the formation of regional economic unions, such as the Middle East Economic Area that incorporates Israel and the Arab states, and other initiatives to promote larger bilateral trade between countries and regions, have helped to more than double the growth rate in world trade.
 With the assistance of the UN's World Development Force, proposed in this report, food shortages have been eliminated from the last famine danger zones in Africa, and total food production on that continent has doubled within a decade.
 Poverty is its direct forms has been eradicated in China and India by strategies that have led to the creation of hundreds of millions of new jobs.

I mean, fuck, she didn’t even open her mouth.
 Don’t you hate that shit?
 So, I’m standing there, I might as well have had my dick out, and she looked at me like I was a piece of modern art that she couldn’t figure out.
 And, finally, after I had already turned back into an awkward 12 year old, she said, sorry, I can’t be doing that.
 That was it.
 That was her explanation.
 I never saw that chick again, I can tell you.
 I mean, I got out of there fast and tried to restabilize my pride, and I just thought, well, fuck it, I don’t know what that was all about, I don’t pretend to understand what that was all about.
 So, anyway, that inspired this song—actually, Lor and I talking about that incident inspired that song.
 The line “she was going through her midtown period/there was blood in the air” is mostly Lor’s.

When I finally got a chance to look back up, Alec and his friends weren't at their table.
 Cassie caught my eye before I looked down, but she was definitely glaring.
 Not the typical I-hate-you-and-I'm-going-to-do-everything-I-can-to-smear-your-reputation-and-get-you-in-trouble-because-we're-in-high-school-and-that's-all-I can-really-do type glaring.
 Instead her eyes seemed to warn me never to go out alone at night because if she ever found me somewhere without any witnesses, they were going to have to hospitalize me.
 I felt a chill run through me, and dropped my eyes out of involuntary reflex.
 I probably would've started shaking if someone hadn't grabbed my shoulder and startled some kind of twisted cross between a shriek and a gasp out of me.
 I turned to give whoever it was a piece of my mind, but Brandon's laughing gray eyes made the words tangle up before they made it down to my tongue.
 "Hey there.
 You still going to that tutoring lab after school?"
 I managed a nod that I thought nearly looked casual.

It is widely believed that acceleration of this process will lead to rising unemployment and a widening gap between the rich and the poor, leading to the creation of a huge under class that had been virtually eradicated in previous decades.
 Is this result really the best these countries can hope for in the foreseeable future?
 The events in Eastern Europe have been widely hailed as a victory for democratic capitalism over authoritarian communism.
 The obvious failure of the latter has been used to support the claim of the former to be the sole political and economic heir to the next millennium.
 This view has been applied to justify the imposition of radical shock therapy on the unsuspecting and unprepared populations of Eastern Europe and stringent structural adjustment programmes on many developing countries.
 But the claim itself is based on a limited and superficial interpretation of history.
 The fall of the Berlin Wall marks the end of a confrontation between two divergent systems that have been struggling toward reconciliation throughout the present century – one based on the human right to freedom and the determinism of the free market, the other based on the right to basic economic security and the determinism of the state.
 One has made people subservient to the needs of the state, the other has left them subject to the whims of the market.
 True communism has never existed.
 What lived and has finally died in Eastern Europe is not communism, but statism, the domination of the state and use of state authority to govern the life of the nation, in practice reducing people to forced labour.

 I looked at the caller ID and it was Steve’s number, not Ashley’s.
 This was even better since the goal was to get him and she was ancillary.
 I picked up the phone, which was still connected to the recording device, and she introduced herself and said she was calling from her boyfriend’s phone because hers was broken.
 The call went better than expected as you could hear Steve coaching her in the background.

Rachel's promise somehow seemed like it belonged from another time.
 The sincerity pulled me further out of my safe, numb shelter.
 Something in me wanted to confide in her, was willing to risk the pain of facing reality, but I was too far gone to be able to put what I was feeling into words.
 I shook my head again, not sure if it was a refusal or something else entirely.
 Rachel took it as the former and sat down next to me, pulling her knees up tight against her chest.
 A few seconds later I heard the howl of an after-market exhaust fed by a turbo-charged engine.
 The green Honda that came screaming through the parking lot was hardly recognizable as an Accord.
 It was approaching too quickly, but I couldn't bring myself to care.
 Besides, Rachel seemed unconcerned.
 Rachel helped me up as the car came to a screeching halt, all four tires locking up to slide it around so that the passenger side was facing us.

Mrs. Campbell was the only teacher who'd taken an active interest in my wellbeing, but I could see his point.
 I managed to do at least a passable job hiding my near frown as I nodded in acceptance.
 "Can I have just a few minutes today after school to tell her?"
 Alec's hand was warm on my face as he nodded.
 "You're amazing.
 All the things being taken away from you just because you got involved with the wrong crowd, and you just do what has to be done.
 Of course you can have a few minutes.
 I'm sorry to make you do this."
 I wanted to tell him it was less than he was doing.
 To say it was the least I could do considering this was all my fault, but the unabashed bliss of having him touch me was overwhelming.

Economic collapse in Eastern Europe: The enormous spread and depth of economic decline among the former communist countries of Eastern Europe during the period 1990–3 exceeds in magnitude the catastrophe that engulfed the capitalist economies during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
 Falling production and incomes coupled with soaring prices are combining to cause political instability, social unrest and extreme hardship to the populations of these nations.
 If not remedied, this could result in a reversal of the remarkable progress towards world peace achieved during the past seven years.
 Arms exports: The cutting of defence budgets has generated increasing pressure on arms manufacturers to seek export markets.
 Although the value (in 1992 US dollars) of arms exports fell by more than 50 per cent from 1988 to 1992, it still represents nearly $20 billion annually.
 These weapons, over 80 per cent of which are supplied by the five permanent members of the Security Council, directly contribute to the growing instability and violence.
 During the last decade, 40 per cent of these weapons were sold to trouble spots such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.
 These are, indeed, severe challenges that call for urgent and determined action by the global community on a scale unprecedented during times of peace.
 But the lessons of the past decade should caution us against accepting as a fait accompli statistical projections that predict the outcome of our effort over the next ten years before it has even begun.
 No such determinism exists, except in our minds.

I don't want that life anymore.
 I don't really want any life that doesn't involve you."
 Part of me wanted to scream for joy, to jump up out of my bed and wrap myself around Alec as tightly as I could, but I was just too far gone.
 I half thought I was dreaming it all.
 As I finally let sleep pull me down into darkness, I almost thought I heard Alec say one last thing.
 The tone was so vulnerable and hesitant he almost sounded like another person.
 "The truth is, I've fallen well and truly in love with you."
 Chapter 23 Someone was calling my name, but I really didn't want to wake up.
 I was still so tired, and I'd had the most wonderful dreams.
 They were a little foggy now, but they seemed to have involved Alec coming to my rescue, and then holding my hand as I went to sleep.

She raised the visor.
 "Can we go to the library now?"
 If this wasn't her home, she was going to find a way to get back.
 CHAPTER FOUR
 Marie sat beside Rick at the library, watching in amazement as titles of books and magazines appeared on a screen in front of him.
 Whenever he found something that he thought could help them, a machine in front of her would print the title and its number on a piece of paper.
 She'd thought it would take hours and hours to find a handful of books.
 But in only 45 minutes Rick had a long list of books and articles.
 He filled out request forms for the articles and led her into more rows of books than she'd ever seen.
 He pulled out book after book, stacking them in her arms.

You know, I love “Day in the Life.”  Shit.
 It doesn’t get much better than that, pop music-wise.
 “I read the news today oh boy” is just about the finest first line I’ve ever heard.
 I’d kill to have written that one line.
 But, does it compare to “April is the cruelest month?” Or “Turning and turning in the widening gyre?”  Or even, “Something there is that does not love a wall?”  No, of course not.
 And John would tell you the same thing.
 I’m not putting down The Beatles, hell, McCartney and Lennon are the greatest songwriting team of all time.
 No question.
 But, poets, naw, they ain’t that.
 Not in the strict meaning of the word.

“So I understand that you are to journey to the Cathedral of the Heavens for this year’s open tourney?” Taiga asked his voice as melodic as one would expect from an elf, but just a tad deeper than one would think.
 “Yes, my lord, I leave in the morning,” Van’dret replied.
 “Excellent, you will have to keep your eyes open for potential talent worthy of the Immortal Guard,” Taiga stated.
 Van’dret nodded, that was one of his main responsibilities, but it could not be why he had been invited up to Taiga’s solar.
 “I would encourage you to be careful on your trip over.
 You did hear about what happened to Ravenhurr?” asked Taiga.
 Van’dret almost felt his eye brows rise, “of course, but what should I watch out for?
 I heard it was just some sort of accident.
 I was not aware that any of the Knights of the Order were implicated.” Taiga smiled and waved a hand in a dismissing motion.
 “Oh, don’t misjudge my words.

I lay there stunned on my back.
 As Dino walked towards me I could see the crowd of guests rushing in behind him.
 He straddled me and I gathered my legs towards my chest with my arms crossed in front of my face to protect myself.
 He looked like a killer standing over me, his eyes big, his teeth gritted and his right fist well above his head poised to pound me again.
 I straightened my right leg out as a kick upward directly into his crotch as hard and fast as I could.
 His body folded around my foot.
 He fell backwards on the ground exposing the crowd of onlookers who stood behind him.
 I stood up and walked by him, looking down at him curled and rolling in obvious agony.
 I walked through the crowd, which parted as I approached.
 Another defining moment.

I pushed myself up and leaned against the tree.
 Emily gave me a light smile.
 “Good morning!” she said and twirled around.
 “Hello bare ground that has no forest!” “You seem to be in a good mood today,” I mused and watched her twirl.
 She stopped and her face crinkled up in thought.
 “I think it's because I didn't wake up to be in a never-ending forest.
 Plus, last night Jason got so sick of arguing with me he just gave up.
 I think I won.” “Great,” I said half-heartedly.
 “That's only because I was too tired to keep arguing with you,” Jason said and he sat down next to Seth.
 “If it was morning, it would have been different.” Emily sighed and shook her finger.

Just before I left elementary school someone had read us a newspaper article about some poor guy being pushed over a railing and falling to his death.
 I'd had nightmares for months.
 Dreams where the stairs had turned slick and I'd slid all the way down them.
 Dreams where the banister hadn't even been there and the stairs had become impossibly narrow, and nightmares where I'd somehow stumbled and started to fall over the edge of the railing.
 This was like all of those dreams put together, only happening to someone else.
 A couple of kids reached out, but the only people who could've really stopped him had already been bowled over.
 Time slowed down for me as he hit the railing and started over it.
 His feet came up and his torso was hanging in the void when someone reached over and grabbed his arm.
 I heard a grunt of effort, saw him stop moving, and only then realized it was Ben who'd nearly died.
 In the split second between Ben being gently placed back on the stairs, and everyone starting to breathe again, I followed the arm that'd saved him back to see who the hero was.

Our marriage was already rocky when we decided to go for another kid.
 Laura wanted another and I agreed, though a counselor we tried working with contended that until we had resolved certain issues, another child would hardly be practical.
 But practicality ranks at the bottom of my aptitude profile, just below biology and basketball.
 We were vagabonds, back then.
 When Darcy was two months old we moved to Iowa for my gradual school (for a definition of "gradual" see or read The World According to Garp, by John Irving who was my first professor there).
 When Cody was two months old, we moved to Arizona for a teaching job I was offered.
 Two years later, we moved to Chico, California for a job with more security, which we craved on account of the little ones.
 But security only exists as a craving.
 Even though the college in Chico gave me tenure, so they couldn’t have fired me unless I kidnapped the president or his wife or daughter, I had to leave it behind because Laura and I split apart and my kids, whom I loved more than life, health, art or anything, went to live in San Diego.
 I tried commuting (1000 mile weekend trips) for a while but, feeling what I imagine was a similar emptiness to that of Mexicans who labor up here for their families in Mexico, I chucked the best job I’ll probably ever have and returned to San Diego.

The three of them were carpenters, down from New York and New Jersey for the winter.
 Bobby Casso was one of them.
 He claimed his dad was a Mafioso until he got on some capo’s hit list and fled to parts unknown.
 Bobby was a master storyteller, and one of his stories pierced my soul.
 In summers, Bobby worked as a bartender at the Left Bank, a saloon in Lindenhurst, Long Island.
 One of the regulars was Jack Kerouac.
 My only living hero, according to Bobby, had become nothing more than a woeful drunk who sat brooding over his liquor until closing time.
 Then, most every evening, he went home with whatever washed out female lasted so long.
 Raskolnikov
 While Bob and I drove home in a 1952 Chevy we bought for $20 from Bobby Casso, I was a lousy companion.

A comparison of the performance of the world economy over the past two decades reveals that after an initial recessionary period of economic dislocation, economic performance has improved on the whole in all regions and almost all countries.
 According to IMF, the growth rate in emerging and developing countries rose from 3.7 per cent annually during the period 1985-94 to 5.1 per cent over the following 10 years and is projected to reach 5.9 per cent in 2005.
 In Sub-Saharan Africa, the rise was from 1.9 per cent to 3.9 per cent and it is expected to reach 5.8 per cent in 2005.
 In the former Soviet republics, growth has accelerated from 0.1 per cent to 4.1 per cent and projected to touch 6.6 per cent next year.
 These trends are likely to continue throughout the decade.
 While foreign aid to developing countries as a percentage of GDP has fallen by 50 per cent since 1990, it has been offset to some extent by a 150 per cent rise in foreign investment.
 In the least developed countries, foreign aid has declined by 24 per cent but this has been offset by a 29-fold increase in foreign investment, so that the combination of foreign aid and foreign investment as a percentage of GDP has remained constant.
 If the rich countries, particularly USA, had met the UN development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of GDP, progress in improving the human condition in countries characterized by a high incidence of poverty would have been faster.
 These real and significant gains have been offset and to a large extent obscured in our minds by the persistence and aggravation of problems that constitute the other side of the post-Cold War ledger.
 Far from vanishing, the nuclear danger has been aggravated by the continued proliferation of nuclear weapons, the increasing danger of these weapons falling into the hands of terrorists, and the stubborn refusal of the existing nuclear powers to seize the opportunity to totally eradicate this pernicious arsenal of self-annihilation.

Marie was doing laundry Thursday afternoon when the phone rang.
 Putting down the lid and turning the machine on, she ran to answer it.
 "Hello?"
 "Hi, sweetheart--how is everything?"
 "Fine.
 I'm doing the laundry."
 "I have a blue shirt hanging on the bathroom doorknob--" "I found it.
 It's in the dryer."
 "Thanks--you're terrific.
 Listen, I called to tell you that I may be a little late tonight."

Jim – It just wouldn’t
 Liz – What would he do?
 Jim – Sumo Assassin would race to the courthouse on the Sumo-mobile crash it through the walls and then Aunt Jeihmima the judge, backing over him once or twice to make sure that the judge would stay down.
 That would only happen after Eugene’s father received the same treatment.
 Liz – I guess that wouldn’t work here.
 Jim – Nope.
 Guess we have two choices here, wait till Gene’s father dies and then move forward with the adoption, or forget it all.
 Johnny – I hate waiting.
 Can’t we pray for Eugene’s father to get hit by a train or something?
 Jim – I don’t think it usually works like that.

Panicked sounds.
 I thought I recognized Chevelle’s voice and tried to focus on it, to understand the agony.
 “Frey,” he said, and something brushed my cheek, warm and feather light.
 The distant impression that it might have been the brush of lips had me drawing in a sharp breath, and I coughed, gasping to fill my lungs.
 The air shifted as those surrounding me moved in response.
 I forced my eyes open and found Ruby, Steed, and Chevelle.
 They looked for a moment as if they were suffering my pain… and then I realized the pain was gone, the siren was silenced.
 My breathing steadied, the fear abating, and their faces relaxed.
 Relief washed their expressions, but their postures remained stiff, alert.
 I pushed up to find the source of the danger and dizziness incapacitated me.

Surely there was something I could have done to help out, even considering the attacks.
 "They can't do that, can they?
 I mean, if they told you that you had the job they can't take it away, can they?"
 Mom rooted around in a half empty box until she found some tissues, it wasn't the first one she'd been through this afternoon.
 "I didn't think so, but Mr. Peters claims there was never any contract signed and I can't find our copy in any of the boxes."
 "Mom, what are we going to do?
 Where will we go if they kick us out?"
 She smoothed my hair back from my face.
 "Don't worry about that, sweetie.
 I'm sure everything will be okay.

I just-I just want to be with my family for a while."
 The thought of being courted was revolting.
 Rick had said that they'd both eventually settle for someone else and get married, but she had no intention of marrying anyone else.
 She would never stop loving Rick.
 After breakfast Marie felt restless and agreed to her mother's suggestion that they go shopping.
 But they'd no sooner begun browsing through the first shop than she began feeling panicky.
 She made herself look at dresses while her mother made her selections, but she wasn't paying attention.
 "I'm going to buy this one," Mrs. Tranton said, holding up a navy blue dress.
 "It's lovely."
 "Haven't you found anything you like?"

The Neldaren warriors charged, hoping to overwhelm their opponents before arrows took them all.
 The elf in the window leaned out to unleash a killing strike, but it was Qurrah who did the killing.
 Four pieces of bone leapt from his hand.
 They hit the elf’s neck and temple, making a satisfying crack.
 The archer spilled through the window and landed with a clattering thud.
 “The rest are yours, brother,” he whispered.

 Liz – (giggles)
 Eugene – Oh funny.
 Look if you don’t want to help…

The other archer pulled back and fired at point blank range.
 Harruq roared as he felt a sharp pain bite into his neck.
 His mind blanked.
 He dropped his swords.
 His hands closed about something soft.
 By the time his rage calmed, blood was on his hands and the remains of an elf lay in the dirt below the window.
 “Stupid elfie,” he said, gingerly touching the arrow in his neck.
 Not knowing what else to do, he closed his hand about the shaft and pulled.
 A minute later, still lying in agonizing pain, the half-orc managed to pry open one of his healing potions.
 He gulped the swirling blue-silver contents and then tossed the vial.

There are just too many of them for us to meet them in a stand-up fight and come out unscathed."
 I didn't like it.
 Mrs. Campbell was the only teacher who'd taken an active interest in my wellbeing, but I could see his point.
 I managed to do at least a passable job hiding my near frown as I nodded in acceptance.
 "Can I have just a few minutes today after school to tell her?"
 Alec's hand was warm on my face as he nodded.
 "You're amazing.
 All the things being taken away from you just because you got involved with the wrong crowd, and you just do what has to be done.
 Of course you can have a few minutes.
 I'm sorry to make you do this."

The half-orc let out a stunned gasp.
 He staggered right, clutching his shoulder as he slumped against the front of a home.
 “Qurrah!” Harruq shrieked, racing to his brother.
 Qurrah shoved away his clumsy attempts to examine the wound.
 “Kill him for me,” the necromancer gasped.
 “Go!
 He cannot live!”
 “But you’re bleeding real bad and…”
 “I have the healing potions, now go!”
 Harruq’s gut screamed against the idea, but in the end, he listened to his brother.

The urge to giggle was so strong I uncapped my water bottle and turned slightly to the side in an attempt to disguise my amusement.
 It was one of those moments I'd try to reconstruct in my head again and again.
 I think I must have heard the cash register till close, or maybe Britney said something.
 Whatever the reason, I took a step in her direction while still looking away, my bottle half raised, and ran into the biggest junior I'd ever seen.
 My clumsiness would've been embarrassing enough all by itself.
 Unfortunately my mostly-full bottle of water splashed all over both of us.
 I felt my cheeks go hot.
 Britney gasped and giggled.
 I silently told myself things were as bad as they were going to get.
 I was wrong.

Mrs. Tranton managed to maintain a pensive expression for a few seconds but then smiled at her daughter.
 "Yes.
 And I think a September wedding would be perfect."
 They discussed bridesmaids and flowers and gardens.
 Marie would wear her mother's wedding gown, which had been carefully stored away for the last 28 years.
 Marie's grandmother had worn it as well, and when Marie took it off after her own wedding, it would go into storage for her daughter.
 Davis chose the next day to approach her father.
 "Come in, my boy," Jefferson Tranton told him, waving the young man into a large, comfortable chair opposite his own in his den.
 "You seemed rather anxious when you telephoned last night."
 "I have to confess that I was.

 Marie asked as she set a bowl on the table.

 She laughed.
 "You were serious about being fed!"

We still do not understand the impact of technology, trade, macro-economic policies, multinational corporations, shifting patterns of foreign investment and many other factors on job creation, and our ignorance severely hampers effective policy formulation and coordination.
 An international research programme should be organized under the ILO to construct a truly global employment model that monitors the impact of technological developments, expanding world trade, plant closings, movement of industry to low-wage countries, agriculture-led industrialization, economic growth, immigration policies, refugee movements and other factors affecting employment opportunities around the world.
 10.Shift focus of technological development: The number of jobs created or destroyed by technology depends on the priority given to various objectives in the process of technological development.
 Presently, there is an in-built bias in technological R & D towards replacing human labour with capital and energy, even when similar levels of quality and efficiency could be achieved by alternative means.
 A conscious shift of focus could lead to the development of more labour-intensive production processes.
 The production of more food to meet the needs of a burgeoning population has been one of the outstanding global achievements of the post-war period.
 It has demonstrated the extraordinary capacity of humankind to meet a collective challenge of monumental proportions.
 It has harnessed the power of science and technology for the most cherished of purposes – preserving human lives.
 It has released the initiative and pride of long suppressed peoples to achieve self-sufficiency and determine their own destinies.
 It has finally lifted the suffocating blanket of pessimistic economic determinism that has stifled human hopes and aspirations for nearly 200 years since Thomas Malthus first set forth the thesis that human population will always outrun the growth of food production, thus ensuring the perpetual poverty of humankind.

If they'd been serious about acing the test, they'd have been here every night for the last two weeks instead of trying to cram a few more morsels of knowledge into their heads at the last minute.
 Mentally shrugging at the stupidity of it all, I pulled out my Spanish and studied my vocab for a few more minutes until Mrs. Campbell came by to wish me goodbye.
 "It looks like most everyone's gone again.
 The last few will probably leave in the next ten minutes."
 She dropped her voice to a conspiratorial whisper.
 "I actually prefer they do.
 That way when their parents phone in to complain about how poorly they did on the exam, I can point out that the lab was open for another hour, but they didn't bother to stick around for the extra help."
 It was a speech that made her sound like a grouchy old lady, but I was starting to know her well enough to take it in the proper context.
 She would gladly have done just about anything to help a student who really wanted to learn, but was tired of having students try and use her as an excuse for their own laziness.
 I waved goodbye to everyone as they left, and then made a quick round of the remaining students.

I shook my head and went back to my desk before my invulnerability wore off and she brought on another attack.
 I missed them both so badly.
 Dad had always been there to listen when I got into problems like this.
 He'd known how to deal with the world, how to work with circumstances so that what resulted was beneficial, or at least something I could live with.
 And Cindi.
 If she were still here this would all be a moot point.
 I hadn't ever needed any other friends while she was alive, hadn't ever had to really put myself out there where I could get dragged into the kind of stupid infighting I'd read about for so many years growing up.
 Chapter 9 I couldn't bring myself to speak to Britney the entire way home.
 It didn't really matter; she spent the whole time complaining about a dozen different ways in which everyone around her was making her life miserable.
 She didn't need any kind of response from me.

But the others were groups you’d never heard of.
 But, that didn’t matter to me.
 I listened to everything.
 At that time everything was equal—my taste was still developing.
 So I was indiscriminately borrowing from everywhere, from any 45 that came across my little portable spinner, it was all equal, you know, it was all music, Lee Hazlewood or Howlin’ Wolf or Roy Orbison or Serge Gainsbourg.
 I remember I had this Terry Callier 45, “Look at me Now,” and I thought it was every bit as good as “Rock Around the Clock” or the Sun stuff or “Lemon Tree”—(laughs)—I didn’t know, man,  I mean it all seemed good to me.

I knew my regular spells; he would counter without a problem.
 So I had to work around the spell.
 The spell was one to hold you from walking or running.
 I actually tried to dance or hop,” she said with a smile.
 “But he was too good, he had those covered.
 But, I have been practicing a spell to float in the air, and that worked.
 The spell was not designed to stop someone from floating in place.
 And then I told Doi’van to throw me at Van’dret.” “That was a crazy chance, as an Immortalist he could have split you in two with his bare hands,” said Rodregas.
 “I know,” she said, her voice a little shaken.
 “But we were out of options and it was the only thing I could think of.” Then she added with more confidence, “Plus, while everyone knows a knight might learn a bit of magic, a sorcerer never learns to fight.

Strategies & Recommendations
 Recent developments may be sufficient to dispel dire forecasts of a world without work, but by themselves they are not adequate to address the real and pressing need to accelerate job creation throughout the world, the essential condition for the world’s billion poor to escape from poverty.
 For that, the Commission argued that concerted action is both necessary and possible to immediately improve employment opportunities for the poor.
 Chapter Four of this report presents a comprehensive package of strategies for both industrialized and developing countries that are as relevant and valid today as they were at the time of publication.
 In order to document the potential for accelerated job growth, ICPF conducted a special country study of India in 1991 and drew up a strategy for creating 100 million jobs in the country within a decade.
 The strategy, which focused on utilizing agriculture and agri-business as engines to stimulate rural incomes and employment opportunities, was endorsed and adopted by the then Government of India, but not implemented for a variety of reasons.
 A review of this strategy one decade later indicates that the potential for achieving full employment in India is fully alive and the current Government’s commitment provides the right circumstances to achieve it in practice.
 This will also serve as an example and model for other countries to emulate.
 Backed by this commitment, the main elements of a successful employment strategy for India have been identified in a separate report prepared for the New Delhi meeting.
 The strategy focuses on giving an income and employment orientation to Indian agriculture, increased support for expansion of enterprises in the informal sector, broadening the on-going self-help group revolution and fully extending it to agricultural operations, upgradation and expansion of the country’s vocational training system, promotion of entrepreneurship and full utilization of information technology as a catalyst for development.

Kojas brought his sword down and swiped Seth’s.
 It twisted out of Seth’s grip and fell to the ground.
 I wanted to scream, but I couldn’t.
 I was frozen in fear.
 Seth dashed to his sword, hand out stretched.
 Then Kojas raised a hand and something dark shot out of it.
 It slammed into Seth’s side and he fell to the ground.
 NO!
 I wanted to scream.
 NO, Seth!

Jess was off to the left, white hot with mixed anger and fear, stabilized only by the cool, controlled pillar of power that was Isaac.
 Jasmin almost hummed under my fingertips like barely-leashed violence, while my other hand drank from the still pond that was Dominic, her mere presence feeding me comfort.
 I'd just finished identifying the raging beast to the right as James, when Brandon stepped into the light.
 He looked like some kind of pagan god, smeared all over with blood, an uneven circle drawn on his chest, filled with sharp, angry lines that didn't mean anything to me, but which made the wolves around me tense and growl.
 "While I appreciate the sentiment, it really is far too late to secure absolution by bringing me the girl."
 His voice had changed, becoming deeper and harsher, with elements that didn't sound like they could come from any human throat.
 He stepped forward, and I felt my chest seize up.
 The transformation I'd sensed the beginnings of at the dance had run its course now and any question as to why someone as cultured as Brandon would associate with a near-psychopath like Vincent was put to rest.
 He was shaking now, quivering with the need to kill, and I realized that it didn't matter whether the darkness inside Brandon had created Vincent or just attracted him to orbit in his sphere like a small moon.
 It was enough to know that Vincent's was the lesser evil.

 CM:  	Um, well, let’s see, in Sum Times, the review said, “’Goodbye to the Shell’ is the kind of self-satisfied soft-rock that John Denver would be proud of.
 If Gardner hates his past so much why can’t he leave it behind?
 Why does he write, ‘Adult us, be real, don't frighten or gull us, Honest Merchant, Home, Bluff City.’?
 Buddy Gardner, Memphis don’t need you around no more.”
 BG: 	(laughs)  What horseshit.

Modern means of communication, increased vulnerabilities of inter-dependent, integrated civil societies, and modern instruments of violence make these forms of war extremely destructive.
 The expansion of war to encompass society poses one of the most serious challenges to national and international security and development and raises fundamental questions regarding war as an instrument of policy.
 For more than two centuries, war has been rationalized as an appropriate instrument in international affairs.
 The increasing destructiveness of violent conflict to society in general has resulted in a shift in military strategy from actual fighting to preventive diplomacy.
 The Helsinki Process, the Stockholm Document, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Warsaw Treaty’s adoption of the doctrine of ‘non-offensive defence’, and most recently the UN Secretary General’s Agenda for Peace – all give highest priority to war prevention.
 While welcome, these incremental measures do not fully recognize either the extent of the danger of the continued application of violence to achieve political ends or the extent of the opportunity which the end of the Cold War has brought for radically altering the way in which humanity settles domestic and international disputes.
 There was a time when war could be justified as a necessary expedient.
 Now the potential human and economic costs of even limited terrorist war – especially if it involves the use of nuclear or biological weapons, but even otherwise – are so great that the risks are no longer tolerable.
 Because the potential risks far outweigh the possible advantages of continued reliance on this means of achieving national and international security, war has become obsolete as an instrument of policy.
 At the same time, there is no longer an insurmountable political conflict within the UN system to prevent all member countries from agreeing to a total ban on the use of violence against each other.

How did that start?
 BG:  	Dickinson.
 Jim, he got us a recording studio at Ardent.
 Got us some studio time.
 He’d been to numerous practices, knew our stuff.
 And he agreed to produce, under the name Euphonious Moniker.
 Of course, now, everyone knows he did it, but back then, I don’t know, there were legal complications or something.
 Anyway, with Jim there, well, he gave us the confidence to do it.
 So we started laying down tracks.
 Now, the story that’s told is that I hated recording, that I was, I don’t know, juvenile, about doing numerous takes.

You have to be kidding.
 Anyway I’m going to check on dinner too.
 (Johnny exits stage, leaving Jim to go back to Sumo Assassin)
 Scene 6
 The basement, the table is in the forefront now.
 Jim is still reading Sumo Assassin while lying on a couch at the edge of the stag.
 The other characters bring in the various courses and implements necessary for Thanksgiving dinner.
 Slowly everyone else trickles in, starting with Art and Karen.
 Art – (Shouts) Jim where are you?
 Jim – (Sits up) Right here, where I’ve been for the last twenty minutes.

He knew what his brother asked.
 He had killed before, but this was different.
 This was a complete surrender to the murderer within.
 He thought of his vow to Velixar, and also to his brother.
 Obedience.
 Loyalty.
 He had sworn his entire life to them.
 What else did he know?
 What else could he be?
 He thought of Aurelia only once before he spoke.

"I prefer my full name, Mr..." "Wilkenson, Mayor Wilkenson.
 Is your mother home?"
 Suddenly struck by the fact that living in the country meant there wasn't anyone around to hear your screams, I almost lied, but for whatever reason I believed him.
 Maybe because he exuded the false, overabundant sincerity I'd come to associate with both the class presidents I'd known back in Minnesota.
 "She's out photographing one of the parks.
 Is there a message you'd like me to pass on?"
 He looked surprisingly uncertain, almost like he was used to working from a script, and didn't know what to do when things didn't go as planned.
 "Do you know when she'll be back?"
 My headshake seemed to unnerve him a little more.
 Presumably he was having a hard time believing in a world where people didn't have fixed schedules, where moms didn't let their daughters know when they'd be back from their outings.

The prevailing opinion among the popular girls off to the left was that I was the biggest slut ever.
 The equally vindictive but more scholastically minded group in front of us was convinced I was just playing with Alec in an attempt to make Brandon jealous.
 It was all so far off that part of me wanted to laugh.
 I couldn't care less if Brandon was jealous, and Alec hadn't even kissed me yet.
 Even so, hearing my name said with such disdain by so many different people took its toll over the course of the class, and before long I was once again fighting the urge to break down and cry.
 Luckily by the end of the class, Mr. Whethers had become so frustrated with the complete lack of attention being paid him by the gossipers, he'd actually started writing them up for detention.
 As class finally ended, James cracked one of the first smiles I'd ever seen grace his face.
 "Wow.
 I never would've thought anyone could push old Whethers so far.
 He just set a school record for the most detentions assigned in a single class."

They’ve already got Northern Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.
 Johnny – Got any proof brain-child?
 Jim – Canadians drink beer, watch obsessive amounts of hockey and say Eh.
 People in those northern states drink beer, watch obsessive amounts of hockey and say Eh.
 All three of those states border Canada.
 Those states have obviously been slowly taken over by advanced Canadian forces.
 Johnny – I suppose that all the famous movie stars born in Canada are really advance scouts for the rest of the army then.
 Spreading their evil propaganda and brain-washing the masses hmmmm?
 Jim – Damn strait, those Canadians are sneaky bastards.
 They spread like a virus, but they do it slowly so nobody notices.

“Honestly,” I told Lisa, “I don’t care if he comes out with a shaved head and a pony tail selling incense at the airport, as long as he comes out clean and sober with the ability to deal with his addiction.” She agreed.
 As we put one foot in front of the other, his journey would begin, hour-by-hour followed by a day then a week and hopefully he would embrace the program and discover whatever was causing his self-destructive behavior.
 Early on, I had many phone calls and up-dates from the staff of the rehab center as to Brandon’s progress, some good and most bad.
 He craved this drug and he would say anything to get it.
 He would claim he was in extreme pain and he needed a doctor or anything as an excuse to escape to the outside world.
 These counselors had heard it all before; as former drug addicts they had used the same tactics.
 He was an adult and could leave the rehab center anytime he wanted, but the staff was well trained in convincing him otherwise.
 Everyone I talked to at Narconon had been through the program themselves and were former addicts.
 The young man assigned to our son was wonderful.
 He explained that he had been through over a dozen programs before this program resolved his cravings and addressed his issues.

"I want you, Marie," he rasped, raising his head to look into her eyes.
 Marie gazed into his eyes for a moment.
 "I can't!"
 she whispered hoarsely.
 "I can't do it.
 I can't do it!"
 She turned and ran to her room.
 Rick hurried after her.
 "I'm sorry!
 Marie, I'm so sorry!"

If I am kind, it's no doubt because of those very experiences that I would've been the most desperate to avoid.
 I think most of the best people are that way exactly because of the things they've endured.
 Individuals like Dominic, Rachel, and Jasmin don't just happen.
 They're the result of a native goodness being tempered and refined by terrible experiences."
 Mallory suddenly doubled over in a fit of coughing that left her white and shaking.
 I jumped to my feet and almost ran for Alec, but she grabbed my hand with more of that fragile strength, and pulled me back down.
 "There isn't anything he can do for me, child, and unless I'm very much mistaken he's more than normally worried right now.
 He's in no kind of way needing yet more to fret about.
 Just let me catch my breath and I'll be as right as ever."
 Several minutes later, once the renewed bout of coughing had subsided, Mallory looked back up at me with wan features.

Liz – They’ll be ready in less than about an hour.
 So what are you two talking about?
 Jim & Johnny – Eugene.
 Liz – The legal problems?
 Johnny – What else.
 Liz – Good point, he has been well behaved lately.
 At least as far as I know.
 I guess there isn’t much else to talk about.
 (To Jim) So you know that Art isn’t allowed to adopt him.
 Jim – That’s what Johnny was saying.

It'd been going for several seconds before it pulled me back from the mental abyss I'd been so eagerly approaching.
 I looked around blankly for several more heartbeats before I finally managed to place the noise.
 Wolves.
 There weren't supposed to be any wolves in the area, but there wasn't any ignoring my ears.
 I numbly pulled myself back up, and began stumbling back towards the party, only to stop as another howl echoed down through the canyon.
 It was between me and everyone else.
 I turned and started into a shuffling run.
 Maybe the wolf would be attracted to the noise and light.
 Maybe I'd be able to get far enough away it wouldn't smell me.
 I'd only been moving for about a minute before another howl sent chills running down my spine.

There must have been more than ten of them gathered together.
 They were parading around a blazing camp fire, mumbling and talking about things I couldn’t hear over the flames.
 Some more emerged from the woods and joined them, their shadows dancing behind them.
 Then all of them suddenly broke out into an ominous song: “He will rise to the heavens, from the very pits of hell.
 To take control of our world, and the gift- less ones as well.
 “He will rule with a flaming torch, and save those who are worthy.
 And for those who aren’t, Well, you better watch out!” They all broke out in crazed laughs, which gave me the impression that each and every one of them was mad.
 Hell, I knew they were already mad.
 They threw dirt at the fire and continued their wild laughs.
 Emily shuddered by me as they lifted their voices in another chorus.

 I’m not the one who failed Gym class.
 Johnny – The Canadian change theory was there.
 I still can’t believe that he even bothered to waste the time to write it down.
 Liz – Neither can I.
 What were you smoking when you came up with that one Jim?
 It sounds like something Eugene would invent.
 Jim – That theory is sound and ingenious.
 The two of you are just blind to Canada’s evil plans.
 Don’t blame me when there’s a Mounty on every street corner.

 "Let's go inside."
 They sat down on the sofa, and Rick held both her hands in his as he faced her.

The scent of mourning floated throughout the town, and he paused to enjoy the bittersweet strands of death that tugged on his heart.
 So many souls lost in battle, and even in the quiet aftermath, it was intoxicating.
 “No sleep tonight,” he said, turning back to the building that had been his shelter.
 Fire swarmed around his fingers.
 Like streams of water, it flowed from his hands, splashing across the roof and setting it ablaze.
 Finished, he ran for an alley to hide as the fire gained the attention of the many patrols.
 He heard footsteps and shouts further down the road so he ducked left, running in between homes as all around the shouts grew louder.
 The houses ended, and like a fleeing thief he burst out into the streets only to slam into a drunken man holding a small bottle.
 The two rolled, a tangle of legs and arms.
 The small bottle shattered.

We went to the ridge with the others, but we didn’t train.
 In fact, I was fairly certain Ruby and Chevelle were avoiding me.
 I waited through the morning and finally—around midday—I gave up and relaxed onto the ground, staring up at the sky.
 The earth beneath me was warm, the sun shining bright.
 I watched as a bird flew high overhead.
 It was gliding, slow and steady on the wind.
 As I shielded my eyes with a hand, I noticed the ink on my wrist and smiled.
 I suddenly knew the soaring creature above was a hawk.
 I closed my eyes and relaxed my arm at my side, imagining flying.
 I breathed deep and conjured the image it would see, looking down on us.

I knew Brandon couldn’t do this because he was too hot on the streets as a snitch.
 I pressed the issue, which was met with emphatic refusals each time.
 The officers continued to hold their ground and refused to agree to work with me.
 I pushed: “I don’t want you to work with me.
 I just want to know what you would do if I contacted you and told you that Steve was meeting me to buy one-hundred Oxys?
 What is your job responsibility in that case?” “We would do our job if someone called and informed us of a drug deal,” Officer White said.
 “If I am able to get Steve busted, would that count for my son’s deal?” I asked.
 The officer and his sergeant left the room for about ten minutes before returning to tell me that it would.
 “We are not condoning or encouraging this in any way,” Officer White insisted.
 That was all I needed.

 Something like ‘Eugene the Destroyer’?
 Eugene – No no no!
 I want a name that rings through the ages, one that people will remember one thousand years from now, one that rolls off their tongue, even as it makes them quiver in fear.
 Jim – Well ‘Eugene the Destroyer’ wont really do that.
 How about Stalin?
 Eugene – Be serious, Stalin’s already been taken, but that’s the kind of fear that I want to inspire.
 Don’t forget it needs to sound good.
 Liz – How about ‘Shaka Zulu Head-Eater’
 Eugene – It sounds good, but it’s way too long.

 Jim – There are a lot of differences…
 Liz – Such as?
 Jim – Well… A Journal… A diary… Journals aren’t pink.
 And… And the cover says diary instead of journal… Journal rather than diary that is.
 Anyone can keep a Journal, where as diaries are usually kept by thirteen year old girls who only talk about their first kiss and the newest popular music groups.
 Liz – How long have you been keeping your diary?
 Jim – I’ve been keeping my JOURNAL since I was 14.
 Liz – And what do you write about?

Most of them seemed to be rapidly losing key items of clothing, and all of them were dancing so close it was hard to tell where one person ended and the other began.
 As Brandon handed me another cup of beer, which I started slowly pouring out on the ground as soon as his back was turned, the loneliness really started to hit me.
 It would be bearable if I had a friend other than Brandon.
 It might even be fun to sit back and laugh at some of the antics making an appearance as people got more and more wasted.
 Instead I was stone cold sober, and the next best thing to completely friendless.
 About the time Vincent tapped the second keg, Brandon looked over at me and flashed a thoughtful smile.
 I would've said nothing could've made up for the last two hours, but it came remarkably close.
 "I'm sorry, this isn't any fun for you, is it?"
 My listless shrug earned me a chuckle.
 "Well then, let's change stuff up a little.

 "I like yours too."
 He pressed his lips to hers.
 Marie nestled close to him, hoping he'd kiss her like he had last time.
 But then she hiccupped.

 BG: 	Well, Reverend King getting shot in Memphis.
 CM: 	That was before Woodstock.
 BG:  	I know, I know.
 I’m not making a timeline here, man, I’m riffing on what went wrong, trying to tell you what it felt like.
 There we were on the world stage suddenly.
 And Memphis became the face of deadly racism.
 It was all too much.
 It was blowing my mind, I admit it.
 I was feeling wrung out.

I ran a calculation for how many pulleys we'd need to lift our weight up the thirty-degree incline on a string able to hold only a fourth as much, only to look over at his paper and see not only had he already arrived at the correct figure, he'd already thought to adjust for starting friction.
 Not used to being outclassed academically, I got flustered, which led to a misplaced decimal, and then an incorrect conversion from English to metric.
 Alec just continued on, never seeming to really hurry, never actually making a mistake, but still grinding through calculations with a speed I might have been able to match on a good day, but couldn't even approach today.
 It would've been much easier to just stop my efforts and watch him work, but I was too stubborn to give up.
 Alec finished up with the theoretical portion of the assignment, and started stringing the pulleys while most of the other groups were still arguing over whether or not they could afford to add a few extra grams for extra credit.
 If there was a single person in the class who didn't need any extra credit, it was Alec; but he calmly loaded the system with an extra sixteen grams, caught Mrs. Alexander's eye, and then smoothly started the train of weights moving up the ramp, over the wall, through the woods, and right up to Grandma's house.
 It wasn't fair that someone who missed so many days of school could be so consistently right.
 He must have an IQ of 160.
 That and an ego big enough for someone twice as smart.
 Mrs. Alexander shuffled over and smiled at the pair of us.

Late morning on a Saturday.
 Jim is relaxed in one of the couches, rereading the newest edition of his favorite comic book when Eugene walks in.
 Eugene – Hey Jim
 Jim – Sup gee dawg!
 Eugene – Not a whole lot…you?
 Jim – Nuthin here yo!
 Eugene – Jim, is Art back yet?
 Jim – Not yet, why do ya ask?
 Eugene – I need to talk to him about something.
 Jim – Well he should be back later today, he was planning on making the opening of Liz’s show.

 You didn't actually hit your head.
 I caught you before you hit the ground."
 I started to shake my head and then thought better of it.
 "Please, every other time I've dropped that quickly I've totally banged myself up.
 You were on the other side of my desk, there's no way you got all the way around it and managed to catch me before I hit the ground."
 The mild amusement on Alec's face froze into something else.
 "Believe what you will.
 There's no reason to worry about a concussion."
 "Then why did you tell the sub I'd hit my head?"

We should now concentrate on these aspects of security, so vital for sustained human happiness and fulfilment.
 It is our hope that this report will be of some help in accelerating the pace of progress in the evolution of a new human ethic conducive to human beings living in harmony with nature and with each other.
 M. S. Swaminathan, Chairman International Commission on Peace and Food Madras, India, 6 July 1994
 Preface to the Second Edition Unprecedented Opportunity, Unfinished Agenda
 Humanity is on the threshold of unprecedented opportunities to promote peace and accelerate human development.
 Yet, as in the past, our vision of these opportunities is obstructed by conceptions and attitudes inherited from a bygone era.
 To fully appreciate the emerging opportunities, we need to more clearly comprehend the events of the past two decades that are the seeds from which these opportunities spring.
 Restructuring the UN
 The formation of the International Commission on Peace & Food was conceived in 1987, a time when mutual suspicions, escalating military expenditure and confrontational Cold War rhetoric blinded the world to the possibility of radically transforming the global security environment.
 Yet, fuelled by the bold initiatives of Mikhail Gorbachev, by the time ICPF conducted its first meeting on the border of the rapidly vanishing Iron Curtain at Trieste in September 1989, the Berlin Wall had fallen, Cold War hostilities had melted, and the prospect of ushering in a more peaceful and prosperous world for all seemed within reach.

How dare he!
 How dare he use his kisses to try to keep her from going home!
 It was already hard enough just to look at him in the morning before she walked in the garden.
 He knew that whenever they kissed, she didn't want to stop, that she'd kiss him forever.
 Just last night he'd told her that they couldn't kiss like that unless they got married.
 And this morning he dared to kiss her that way, knowing that it would make her all but forget her walk!
 When she returned to the house nearly half an hour later, she stormed past him and up to her room.
 Rick knew for sure that she was mad this time, knew why, and knew he'd been wrong to do what he'd done.
 "Sweetheart, I'm sorry," he called running after her.
 "I shouldn't have done it.

Mrs. Sorenson, my biology teacher, was a skinny old woman with curly white hair that looked like Greek paintings of Medusa.
 She made me introduce myself to the class and then let me slink over to my assigned seat.
 I left the class even more depressed than I'd been when I woke up.
 I'd kind of known I'd have an incredible amount of material to catch up on from the first part of the semester.
 I hadn't anticipated that every other student was going to spend the class carefully ignoring me.
 I'd never really fit in, but this was unbelievable.
 New students could always count on someone to offer to be their friends.
 I'd seen it a dozen times before as people had moved in.
 The really attractive people got drawn into the popular circles, less cool people were offered a place with the punks, the nerds, or at least with the drug users, who didn't care as much what you looked or acted like as long as you were hooked on something illegal.
 I knew I had serious problems, but I didn't think they were obvious to everyone that looked at me.

On the day of the funeral, we went from church to viewing to church to graveyard, always with another sermon or eulogy, with unbelievable crying and hysterics.
 I was in the family limo with my mother, my brothers and poor old Grandpa (Dino’s father).
 Before I got in the limousine a man walked up to me and introduced himself as Grandpa’s doctor.
 He handed me a bottle of small white pills and told me they were nitroglycerine tablets and to get one under the old man’s tongue if he seemed to be having a heart attack.
 Great, Grandpa is rambling in Greek and may die on my watch!
 At least Dino is not here to beat me if I fuck this up.
 So in the limo I’m tossing these little white pills in Grandpa’s mouth like candy.
 I have no idea what I am doing, but he is still alive and rambling away in Greek.
 As the limo drives from location to location for this funeral-a-thon, my little brother Harry is watching a helicopter above us.
 At first, it is a welcome distraction, but the chopper keeps showing up.

The landlord met me, Lisa, Harry, Harry’s wife Anabel, and a shaking miserable Brandon at the house, and I felt sorry for the owner of this home.
 He was a deeply religious man accompanied by his mousy wife and perfectly groomed daughter, all dressed in their Sunday best on their way home from church.
 He had believed all of Brandon’s lies, trusted my son and his roommates and ended up landlord of a drug den.
 He was devastated to see the condition of his property but he was strangely calm and understanding.
 He simply wanted our help to get Brandon’s belongings out of his house and fix things as best we could.
 He gave us an offer we couldn’t refuse.
 If we would get everything out by the evening and pull out all of the carpet, he would not pursue damages.
 None of us were prepared for what we saw when we turned the key in the lock and opened the door.
 Paper and cardboard blackened the windows.
 When we removed these window covers, we found broken panes behind them.

 Eugene – I need to talk to him about something.

 Doctor- seize him!
 (A pair of uniformed guards enter and grab character 1)
 Character 1- (panicing) I think there has been some sort of mistake!
 I’m not Mister Bond, and I’m not here to have fun.
 I’m just here to get my head examined, and get some pills.
 Doctor – (looks at the papers on the clipboard) Ah yes, my error.
 Guards leave us(Guards exit).
 Please have a seat, and make yourself at home.

"I'm sorry I wasn't around yesterday.
 Some things came up that demanded my attention."
 The music was lower than usual, a possible sign he wanted to talk?
 "Did you manage to resolve them successfully?"
 Again that incredible smile flashed across his face.
 "They were touch and go for a little bit, but I'm most pleased with how everything worked out."
 I'd spent all of Monday in a daze, and felt much the same now, only this time it was a daze of good fortune.
 It hardly bothered me when Britney snubbed me during English.
 I flew through my Algebra assignment, finishing up the one from yesterday as well as the one Mrs. Campbell assigned, before the bell rang to release us.
 The only thing that even threatened my bubble of happiness was when I walked into the lunchroom and saw that Britney was sitting with the cheerleaders who'd come and sat at our table yesterday.

Rachel shrank in on herself a little.
 It almost looked like she was going to cry, which should have made me feel bad, but I was too mad to care.
 I'd been miserable the whole way there, and especially the whole way back, and then she wanted to just pretend like none of it had happened.
 Rachel's lip trembled slightly as she finally managed to get a response out.
 "This isn't like you.
 Why are you doing this?"
 Cindi used to do the exact same thing.
 Her 'woe is me, I don't understand what is happening act' had usually worked with Dad, and it'd always infuriated me.
 It had much the same effect now.
 "This isn't like me?

"It's so hard to pretend we don't live together."
 He kissed her hair.
 "That's because it's become so natural to you."
 Rick sat in a chair across from Marie rather than joining her on the loveseat so that they wouldn't appear too familiar with each other.
 He was glad his conscience had gotten the best of him and kept him from seducing her Monday night.
 If having Teri and Jeremy suspect that they were living together embarrassed her, losing her virginity before marriage would devastate her.
 "So how did you like my sister?"
 Rick asked Marie when their guests had left.
 "She's really nice.
 So is Jeremy.

Rodregas stepped up and just stared at him.
 He was beautiful.
 “Don’t touch,” barked Doi’van.
 Rodregas nodded, he knew not to touch, but then realized that his hand was raised and had been reaching out to stroke the lion’s mane.
 He knew that this was the greater sigil that he wanted to gain.
 It was in a perfect circle.
 He had taken in the essence of the Celestial Lion back at Raven Keep, and now Rodregas would consume his own magical power with the greater sigil of a Celestial Lion and become a perfect vessel for its power.
 Rodregas forced himself to step back.
 This was their chance for Doi’van, and he would get a second chance if needed.
 He looked over at the other two.

Harruq stretched, pushed away a plank of wood from the window, and climbed out.
 The sun was halfway visible, the standard noises of the city only in their infancy.
 Leaning against the shed, his eyes staring off toward the sunrise, waited Qurrah.
 “What are you doing out here?” Harruq asked.
 “Did you sense it?” Qurrah asked.
 “Sense what?”
 The smaller half-orc shook his head.
 “If you must ask then you did not, at least not directly, though I did hear you startle awake.
 Perhaps a fleeting glimpse of it…”
 “Qurrah,” Harruq said, crossing his arms and frowning at him.

Alec made them look like drunken frat boys.
 Vincent spun around so fast it almost looked like he was going to fall down and then backed away from both of them like a cornered animal.
 It was hard to decide whether my excitement at seeing the biggest jerk I'd ever met humbled outweighed my dislike for Alec, who'd pretty much locked up the honor of being the second biggest jerk.
 A surge of dread washed through me as Vincent backed closer to the wall in an effort to maintain his distance from Alec.
 I half expected for the incredible tension I'd been feeling before to disappear, but instead it morphed slightly.
 If I hadn't known it was absolutely absurd, I would've said it felt like there was a tingly wind blowing down the stairs, pushing Vincent along before it.
 Isaac moved slightly.
 It was a small change of position, but somehow incredibly menacing.
 It wasn't until Vincent froze in place that I realized Isaac's shift had kept Vincent squarely between him and Alec.
 It was like watching a pair of wolves bringing down an elk.

He would pay the cost.
 Great spasms racked his body.
 All the power Velixar had granted him fled.
 His muscles shrank inward, tightening in great, painful shudders.
 Several minutes passed as the horrendous pain tore through his arms, chest, and legs.
 Aurelia held him as he lay sobbing in pain.
 She did her best to comfort him, stroking his hair until all his dark strength drained away.
 Exhaustion came soon after, and for an agonizing time Harruq lay there, mumbling incoherently and waiting for the pain to fade.
 At last, he looked up to Aurelia, his eyes a calm brown, the whites bloodshot.
 “I love you,” he said.

His mouth covered hers, his kiss slow and hot and thorough.
 She wrapped her arms around him, trying to get closer to him.
 When he raised his head, she whimpered, wanting his mouth on hers again.
 But she gasped with pleasure as he began nibbling on her earlobe.
 Rick wanted to do much more than kiss her, and she was making it difficult to resist.
 He'd never held a woman so eager, so responsive to his slightest touch.
 But he had to stop.
 He had to stop now.
 He raised his head, straightening and pulling away.
 But Marie clung to him, rubbing her face against his neck.

"I don't think it was a mistake.
 I want to kiss you again, but I'll behave."
 "You like the painting then?"
 I nodded, and then shivered.
 It's amazing how a near complete loss of physical control can burn through your energy reserves.
 Alec frowned.
 "I'm sorry.
 I forget sometimes how much easier it is for you and Rachel to catch a chill.
 Let's get you inside where it's a bit more temperate."
 It seemed like such a waste, leaving the grotto after all the work that'd been put into transforming it, but Alec waved away my protests.

“There shall I be.”
 A pale hand reached inside his robes and pulled out five glass vials.
 Qurrah knelt and accepted the gifts.
 “The vials contain powerful healing elixirs.
 If either of you are injured tomorrow, drink from them and resume the slaughter anew.”
 “Thank you master,” Harruq said, accepting three from his brother before kneeling as well.
 “We will await you in the chaos,” Qurrah said.
 Then the man was gone, vanishing into the shadows of the room.
 The two glanced at each other.
 Harruq shrugged.

It was a gathering including all the students and the staff.
 Prior to the ceremony we were invited to eat dinner with everyone.
 We walked the food line with all who attended, a variety of foods were spooned into our plates and I felt like I was it was chow time in the mess hall.
 We were seated close to the front in a crowded cafeteria room.
 The room was a scattering of mismatched tables and chairs and old couches that were obviously a collection of donations.
 It started with accolades and awards for those early in their treatment and worked its way through the students by their personal achievements inching towards the finale of the three students set to “graduate” tonight.
 Everyone who was recognized for reaching a new level of their treatment was welcome to speak if they wished.
 Those who were in the program longer were more likely to do so, thanking others (both students and staff) for helping them through their most difficult challenges.
 Some were very emotional and some were humorous, all were heartfelt and meaningful descriptions of their individual challenges to reach that next level.
 It was clear that everyone here, whether they were staff or student, had the ability to impact anyone they touched.

“And take every one you find with you.”
 The old man put a hand on the young farmer’s shoulder.
 “Fear not,” he said, a weak smile on his face.
 “Ashhur’s golden eternity awaits us.”
 Jeremiah raised his sword so that the flame of his torch flickered across it.
 “Not this night, not if I can help it,” he said before running toward the battle cry.
 The town held only ninety members, half of them younger than eighteen.
 When the second brutal cry rolled over the houses, most were running west, dragging children and carrying young ones in their arms.
 The men, young and old, took up torches, shortswords, even rakes and sickles, and prepared to defend their homes.
 Bravely they fought, and bravely they died.

I didn’t know which of the group were restraining him, but Anvil and Grey flanked him, Rhys and Rider a distance behind with their dogs.
 The man seemed to be attempting to speak but couldn’t get the words out.
 His hair was so pale, robe stark in the moonlight, that I became aware of how quickly I’d grown accustomed to the dark features of my new companions.
 Chevelle mumbled something but I couldn’t make it out.
 My ears had begun to buzz, not the all-out siren that had crippled me before, but a constant, crackling hum.
 I worked my jaw, tugged at the lobe of my ear.
 The stranger’s lips moved, apparently able to speak again, and Anvil approached him, dwarfing the captive with his mass.
 Anvil exhibited remarkable menace when he addressed the frozen councilman, who mouthed another reply.
 Through ringing ears I couldn’t decipher their words, but somehow I did hear the breaking bones.
 A grotesque crunch accompanied the snapping of the councilman’s thigh, and he dropped nearly to the ground.

She frowned, trying to remember what expression she must have had on her face that night.
 But she hadn't been thinking about how she looked; she'd been thinking about how he looked.
 And how his lips would feel on hers.
 It was as they were cleaning up after breakfast that inspiration struck her.
 Handing him a tub of butter, she caught his gaze, holding it as she thought about the way he'd kissed her yesterday afternoon.
 Entranced by Marie's beautiful hazel eyes, Rick drew her close and bent his head to kiss her.
 Seconds later, he was startled by a giggle that interrupted their kiss.
 "What's so funny?"
 he demanded.
 "It works!"

I've been fine."
 Freeing her hand, she moved away from him and retrieved her tea.
 The warm family atmosphere was suddenly replaced by an awkwardness that was only relieved by a lively business discussion among the three men.
 Marie caught her mother's glance, and the two ladies went to the kitchen to get some pastries and coffee.
 "Don't worry, Marie--the two of you just need some time alone together to talk."
 "No."
 Marie shook her head.
 "I'm not going to marry him."
 "What?!"
 "I don't love him, Mother.

My claws sank into his arms and legs as I repositioned to snap his neck, and then a hammer blow of weight struck me across the shoulders.
 Knocked loose from Vincent, I spun around in time to tear Simon from the air as he leaped at me again.
 It was the perfect opportunity to end a life nearly as evil as Vincent's, but one of the recent arrivals had bowled Jasmin over.
 Leveraging a frame that was more than capable of picking up a small car, I threw Simon into the whirling ball of flesh and fangs.
 He didn't hit hard enough to snap his neck, but he knocked the other wolf off of Jasmin, and then Vincent was back on his feet.
 The rest of the rival pack, save for Brandon their leader, came streaming past, but they didn't help their fellows swarm Jasmin and me over.
 None of them even slowed.
 Vincent took an angry swipe at the last, a small female, and then our pack burst from the trees.
 A second later, our enemies were in full rout.
 Splintered Excerpt Alec had been promising to take me somewhere new for nearly a week, but pack business kept getting in the way.

 No one listens to them except the few hundred souls who go to their shows, but their stuff intrigues me.

“This is stupid.
 I’m leaving.”
 “Stay, please,” Aurelia said.
 The half-orc halted, turned, and sat back down.
 His face was still beet red but the elf paid it no mind.
 “Alright,” Harruq grumbled.
 “No interrupting, and no saying a thing.
 I just want to get this over with.
 Don’t even know why I’m telling you this.”
 “Because you must,” she said, a bit of her stubbornness returning.

"You're crying!
 What's wrong?"
 "Nothing new.
 I-I'm frightened, Rick."
 He gazed down into those huge, shimmering hazel eyes and felt his heart melt.
 "It'll be all right, sweetheart."
 He sat down on the edge of the bed and drew her into his arms.
 "We'll get you back home.
 And until we do, I'll take care of you.
 I promise."

The reform programme was developed and guided by domestic and foreign economists who viewed the transition much like a change of clothing – the casting off of one set of economic principles and the adoption of another – ignoring the critical importance of social and political factors.
 This view could be summed up in the often expressed attitude, ‘Good economics makes good politics!’
 Transition is the process by which society moves from one form or level of activities to another.
 While social scientists conveniently divide social activity into several categories – political, economic, social, educational, religious, cultural – in practice these distinctions are at best only partially true.
 Economic activities in any society take place on the foundation of the political system, social values and customs, and the psychological aspirations and attitudes of the people.
 During normal periods of slow and gradual change, the impact or role of other dimensions operates below the surface and appears minimal.
 Economists studying the results of economic variables tend to overlook the influence of factors from other fields on the assumption that non-economic factors are constant.
 Under relatively stable and static conditions, these economics principles can be employed to predict changes in economic variables to a considerable extent.
 But under circumstances in which underlying economic, social and political conditions are undergoing radical change, the relevance and predictive capacity of purely economic concepts is quite limited.
 This was the situation confronting the states of the region at the beginning of the transition period, and the reason why the actual results of the reform differed so drastically from what had been anticipated.

I think about kissing you and touching you--with your shirt off."
 She kissed him, her hands moving restlessly over his chest.
 Nuzzling his ear, she told him, "It's probably wrong for me to tell you these things.
 But I want to tell you everything.
 I want you to know how I feel."
 Rick pulled her onto his lap and began devouring her mouth.
 If he didn't know better, he'd swear she was the most cunning seductress he'd ever known.
 Her innocence combined with her confession was a powerful aphrodisiac.
 She was so trusting and yet so passionate, her mouth as hungry as his, her hands caressing and clutching and clawing at his chest and shoulders and neck.
 Hadn't she understood a word he'd said?

And she let me kiss her, but, man, nothing back.
 I mean, fuck, she didn’t even open her mouth.
 Don’t you hate that shit?
 So, I’m standing there, I might as well have had my dick out, and she looked at me like I was a piece of modern art that she couldn’t figure out.
 And, finally, after I had already turned back into an awkward 12 year old, she said, sorry, I can’t be doing that.
 That was it.
 That was her explanation.
 I never saw that chick again, I can tell you.
 I mean, I got out of there fast and tried to restabilize my pride, and I just thought, well, fuck it, I don’t know what that was all about, I don’t pretend to understand what that was all about.
 So, anyway, that inspired this song—actually, Lor and I talking about that incident inspired that song.

“I don’t care what the heck you say about dying because nothing will stop me from killing all of you!
 You’re making no apparent sense at all, and I don’t care what stupid message you’re trying to send me!” I hissed so bad I think that I spit.
 Gross.
 “Oh but you will care, half-ling.” The dwarf was now whispering and all the others had fallen silent so they could hear.
 “You will care because in the end, he will destroy you once he’s done using you.” My arms were still tense and my muscles whined in protest as I held my arrow back in full draw.
 “Use me to do what?” I spoke, using the same tone as him.
 The dwarf’s eyes were twinkling in happiness.
 He seemed happy to tell me the answer.
 “To take over the gift-less ones’ world, why else half-ling?
 You’re the connection between Igneeria and your world.

I sat on the cold stone floor, shivering.
 I was soaked to the skin and my hair was completely plastered to my head.
 Seth sat next to me and I could see he was shivering too.
 Jason slid down the wall across from us with his eyes closed.
 “I never want to walk again,” he mumbled.
 “Never.” “You're going to have to, dude.
 We have a lot of walking left to do,” Seth said wearily.
 Jason groaned and circled up against the wall.
 Emily pulled her hood off and examined herself.
 She mumbled something and squeezed her sleeves.

He ordered Sonowin lower, shouting out the command as another barrage of bone pelted four more elves to their deaths.
 Skimming above the darkness, Dieredon fired volley after volley behind him.
 When they were past the undead, he pulled Sonowin high into the air to observe the battlefield.
 The ranks of the undead were half of what they had been, yet still he could not see the lowered black hood he so badly needed to see.
 “Come, Sonowin, we will find him, even if it means killing every last one of his puppets.”
 The horse neighed and dove, spurred on by the sight of its own kind falling in death.

Rodregas had never done it; he had learned that there were better ways to kill a man than trying to break his spine with bare hands.
 But with the memory of Korin breaking Jorin’s neck, adrenaline pounded in his new arms.
 This was justice long overdue.
 With a quick movement of his arms and the haunting memory of the sounds of crunching and popping from all those years ago, he twisted Korin’s head nearly all the way around.
 Rodregas held his body as it spasmed wildly for a moment.
 Then the Adapt went still and limp; and Rodregas dropped him to the floor.
 Korin’s’ body hit the floor and started to empty itself.
 “Gods,” he thought and asked out loud to no one, “What did he eat this morning?” He grabbed the body and dragged it into the water closet and dropped it into the small bronze tub.
 Rodregas started to leave and then saw Korin’s purse; the Adapt was dressed for travel and Rodregas had yet to find even a single coin in the Master’s chambers.
 He reached down and took the purse off his belt.

For a project in her second grade class, she wrote and illustrated a book, which her teacher bound, entitled The Fast Friendly Pitcher’s Bad Remembering Day.
 I suppose if I live another thirty years, my eyes will still mist when I think of my girl as the fast friendly pitcher.
 University of Arizona, whom I count as my team since I taught there for several years, is leading University of Hawaii when we leave, on account of a book signing.
 My friend Alan, with whom I’ve partnered for a lot of book signings, likes to hound me about a remark I once made, “There’s no such thing as a bad signing.” Well, by now I’ll admit that there is such a thing.
 But most often, even if you don’t sell many books, interesting stuff happens.
 And you never can tell when you’ll get blessed.
 Or challenged.
 Or both.
 A woman of kind and friendly demeanor comes into Chapters, a coffee shop bookstore in Newberg, Oregon, about a half hour from Portland.
 I’ll call this woman Curly.

Every job created in automotive manufacturing has spawned roughly ten more in related occupations.
 Thus, about 9 per cent of the USA’s entire workforce is employed in occupations directly related to automotive manufacture, sales and services, road construction and maintenance, and transport of freight and passengers.
 Globally, 7 to 9 million workers were employed in automotive manufacturing in 1980 and perhaps as many as 50 to 80 million in related occupations.
 In addition, the spread of automotive technology has had tremendous impact on the growth of other industries stimulated by the greater mobility of the public – retail trade, hotels, restaurants, tourism, recreation – and indirectly on agriculture, as well as every other service and manufacturing industry that benefits from lower cost and greater speed of passenger and freight transport.
 Advances in technology provide society with greater conveniences and in the process endow the society with greater creative and productive abilities.
 Over time, these new abilities spur the creation of new activities in many different fields distantly related to the original point of innovation.
 The process results in improvements in health, which raise the level of physical energy; higher standards of education, which raise the level of mental energy and culture; and higher levels of social skills and organization, which raise the energy level of the entire society, making it ever more creative and productive.
 A comprehensive study of this wider process of job creation and destruction arising from technological innovation is needed to develop specific coefficients for measuring the impact of technological advances in different fields on total employment.
 Eventually, we may hope to dispel the widespread fear and sense of helplessness that this issue evokes.
 The notion that there are a fixed or inherently limited number of jobs that can be created by the economy is a fiction.

"If we wait, we probably won't go."
 Cliff was more sensible.
 He said my mom could be right.
 I didn't relent until after his mom lectured us in practically the same words.
 Whatever the meaning of Eric’s death, it might've been losing him that convinced me to give up on Karen Flagstad.
 Anymore, the whole idea of having a best friend spooked me.
 Better to keep my secret life to myself and guard my heart than to trust somebody I was almost sure to lose---because that was how life worked---and mourn over.
 But then, in that way life has of confusing every issue, Karen invited me to be her graduation partner, which meant only walking side-by-side in a procession.
 Still I invited her to the prom.
 She accepted.

I didn’t understand what was happening, couldn’t quite form a thought.
 I yearned to retreat into the horse, run from the agony, but the severity of it tore me back and kept me there in my own head.
 It felt and sounded like metal bands inside my mind, inside my ears, screeching.
 I hadn’t opened my eyes again and now I couldn’t.
 I couldn’t find my body; I wanted to bring my hands to my head, cover my ears.
 But I couldn’t feel anything aside from the pain in my mind.
 I focused all of my energy on finding some feeling somewhere and finally, though the terror was unrelenting, I felt my body again, knew it was there.
 It still didn’t respond, but I knew I hadn’t fallen with the horse.
 Something had caught me.
 Not the ground, not a rock.

I was thinking of Chevelle’s loss, of my own, and now of Ruby’s.
 How could we all be without family?
 “Your mother…” I trailed off.
 He sighed.
 “My mother died years ago, with a large part of the northern clans.” I cringed.
 His mother had died because of my mother.
 The same as Chevelle.
 I was almost afraid to ask.
 “And your father?” He smiled.
 “My father wanders the mountain… killing fairies.” My jaw dropped.

Liz – They’ve got the best donuts anywhere.
 Jim – A challenge that must be met.
 I shall eat a donut from this restaurant, and shall judge them.
 Liz – You will eat many of their donuts, and you will go home stuffed.
 We need to stop, this is making me hungrier.
 Jim – (as they head off stage) Would you care to join me in the partaking of the last meal?
 We can feast upon donuts together.
 Liz – (exits stage with Jim)

"If you get home, I'll miss you."
 "I'll miss you too," she whispered, hugging him.
 She made herself focus her mind on her parents as she wandered through the garden.
 She missed talking to her mother.
 She knew her mother would understand about Davis.
 All she wanted was for Marie to be happy.
 She'd always been nice to Davis, but she'd never treated him like a son.
 But she'd love Rick.
 Rick was so warm and funny, and her mother would feel comfortable with him.
 She stopped, squeezing her eyes shut.

The smirk hadn't left.
 "No, he was very clear on that point.
 You're not to know.
 That's the one thing guaranteed to make him go through with his threats.
 You'll just have to be satisfied with the fact that you'll both continue to be able to live in our fine city."
 Normally I would have just acquiesced, but I couldn't bear the thought of letting him leave, taking with him the identity of the only person besides my mom who really cared what happened to me.
 I tightened my grip in an attempt to stop him.
 "Please, if you won't tell me who it is, let me write a thank you note.
 I have to do something.
 He's done so much for us."

Rick tilted her chin up, making her meet his eyes.
 When she didn't pull away, he lowered his mouth to hers.
 Marie's heart pounded, her hands clutching convulsively at his wet shirt.
 Her eyes fluttered shut, but his lips had barely touched hers when she pulled back.
 "Rick--" "Marie."
 He brushed his lips over hers and nuzzled her cheek before burying his face in her neck.
 He was holding her so tightly and her heart was beating so hard that she was sure he could feel it.
 She wanted to kiss him more than she'd ever wanted anything .

But, hell, why else are we doing this?
 It’s gotta be a story or people aren’t gonna read it, aren’t gonna care.
 It’s gotta have an arc and that arc has to end with some kind of positive energy, some chi.
 You know how to do this, right?
 I’m counting on this being my record, what’s gonna make sense out of something that really doesn’t.
 A man’s life.
 An artist’s life, if I can speak in such terminology.

Emily ran over to me but was plowed to the ground.
 She screamed, spitting out dirt, twigs and leaves.
 Seth stood watching, terrified.
 He didn’t have a clue as what to do to fight these invisible creatures.
 None of us did, at that time, because we didn’t know what was going on.
 The world was still a normal place to us at the time.
 Something grabbed Seth’s legs and pulled him against a tree.
 He kicked and punched but couldn’t find the right place to hit his attacker.
 “Hold on!” Jason yelled.
 I opened my mouth to say that we already were when he vanished.

And, let me add here, that I got a call from Pete, it was in, oh, 1969 or so, and he’d gotten a copy of the album—God knows where—and he was agog at that cut, he asked me how I got the distort sound on my guitar.
 Pete Fucking Townshend, man.
 CM:  	Wow.
 How did you get that sound?
 BG:  	Jim’s idea.
 From “Rocket 88” of course, everyone knows that story.
 Jim kicked in my amp.
 I was dumbfounded—he was like some shaman so I didn’t protest—and that hole in the amp is what gives my guitar such a weird sound on that cut.
 I had a fuzz pedal too—a Pep box, and an Astrotone, but, Jim wanted that Memphis thing, you know, he wanted to tie us into the whole mojo, from Sun, from Ike Turner, through Keith Richards on “Satisfaction”—which is a cop from Sam, don’t let anyone tell you different, through the swamp music of Mudboy—up to us.
 At this time, remember, I was like attached to the guitar, man.

 It might well have been since Mother really didn’t want that one in the show, but it has made a lot of people laugh, and the posters of it are selling well.

 Liz – For you, it’s on the house, and I’ll sign it as well.

Seth showed up after that, placed his bag on the ground, leaned on the statue next to me, and didn’t say a word.
 We all stood there waiting for the dwarf to show up.
 Right as I was about to give up and say we had the wrong place, he appeared.
 Jason saw his blurry outline first and signaled us to enter the Half-way.
 The wind whirled around me, and I walked over to the dwarf with the others.
 The dwarf was breathing heavily, trying to catch his breath.
 All four of us stood there waiting and when he got his breath back, he spoke.
 “I am glad that you accepted my message,” he said to Seth and me.
 Then he turned to Emily and Jason and said, “Ah, it’s great to meet the other two.” He beamed at all four of us.
 “Hi,” Emily said, looking a little freaked out.

Aurelia felt her stomach churn.
 Her assailant turned her around and flung her back against the wall.
 She glared at a pock-marked soldier bearing the crest of Neldar.
 “You’re a pretty one,” he said, his smile missing several teeth.
 He yanked at his belt while his other arm pressed against her chest and neck.
 “And you’re an idiot,” she spat.
 Much of her magic was gone, but not all.
 Her hand brushed his, and a small shock of electricity crossed between them.
 The soldier instinctively pulled his hand back, giving Aurelia the opening she needed.
 She squirmed out from beneath, gripped her staff, and then whirled.

Bound against using magic.
 Assigned a watcher.
 My anger toward him returned, swift and unforgiving.
 He had been a volunteer.
 “Let’s just go,” I said coldly, looking up the mountain.
 We rode wordlessly on as I chewed over this new knowledge.
 As my watcher, Chevelle would have been involved in the binding by Council.
 Maybe Fannie should have been punished for whatever she had done, but how could they assume I would follow in her footsteps?
 So I’d killed a bird, stolen a few papers from the council library.
 My argument faltered, so I went back to anger, betrayal that he had lied to me.

 Seth unchained his bike and rode off with him.
 I realized then that Seth had barely said anything the whole time, but he was already out of sight.
 I’d have to question him later.
 I sighed, “Well, at least we can hang out early.” “Well, while you were arguing with the boys I called home and they said you could come over now.” Emily flashed me one of her million-watt smiles.
 “Great!” I piped.
 “I’ll call home quickly to check with my parents.” I called home and my parents said I could go, which wasn’t much of a surprise.
 I’ve been to plenty of sleepovers at Emily’s, so my parents didn’t mind.
 Plus, our parents were close and Emily’s family was practically an extension of our own.

During the 1980s Europe chose a high-wage path to growth, passing on the benefits to the existing workforce but creating relatively few new jobs; whereas the United States, with a similar economic growth rate over the decade, showed lower income growth per worker, but a steadily rising employment rate.
 Europe is now confronted with the need for structural adjustment to compensate.
 In the United States, the extent of the unemployment problem is partially disguised in the form of low-wage jobs, which distribute total income over a larger number of workers.
 Twenty per cent of all full-time US workers have incomes that fall below the official poverty line for a family of four, though only a quarter of these live in households whose total income is below the poverty line.
 Real wages in the United States have not risen significantly over the last 20 years due to the dramatic increase in the supply of labour as a result of a 62 per cent increase in female participation since 1960 and the entrance of the baby-boom generation into the workforce.
 However, America’s ‘family living standard’ has still risen by 40 per cent since 1970.
 Within the next decade, the aging of the population is expected to reduce job pressures and even lead to labour shortages in some European countries.
 Job growth has been quite rapid in the developing countries over the last forty years, more than doubling total employment.
 The single most important factor behind rising numbers of unemployed persons and increasing absolute numbers of families below the poverty line in developing countries has been the 2.4-fold expansion of population in the Third World, and more than doubling of the economically active population since 1950, which have resulted in a 4 per cent decline in the overall employment rate.
 Population growth rates continue to fall steadily in most countries, with the exception of Africa, providing an opportu nity for economic growth and job growth to catch up with the population explosion of recent decades.

 Eugene – I said it in a plain voice.

 Liz – Oh, poor Gene.
 Jim – At least they didn’t chase you off the bus, or hurt you.
 Eugene – I did manage to make some cash, so it’s not a complete loss.

The damage to the brickwork was no doubt the work of those stupid potato guns.
 Now get out of here before I start handing out detention assignments."
 Brandon was tugging on my arm now, not hard enough for anyone to think he'd been driven off by a mere school administrator, but urgently enough I allowed myself to be guided away.
 We hadn't gone more than a step or two before his grip on my arm grew painful.
 I hissed in discomfort and he released me, but not before I noticed that his other hand was white-knuckled and his jaw was clenched.
 "Sorry, I just don't like to see that kind of needless destruction.
 It makes everyone look bad and costs the town a lot of money."
 Brandon's smile was back, but it didn't have his trademark easy carelessness.
 "Now you sound like my mom."
 We rounded a corner before Brandon could say anything else and nearly ran into Britney.

“You are weak!
 Weak!”
 The cry of a child sent him bashing through the door of a small home.
 Inside, a girl huddled beside her much younger sister.
 They were wrapped in blankets.
 The little girl clutched a doll in her hands.
 Harruq paused, and deep in his heart, some piece of him shrieked in protest.
 “I’m sorry,” he said.
 Salvation and Condemnation quivered in his hands.
 “There’s no room for compassion.

When I arrived at home I called Officer White’s phone and told him I had a drug deal set up with Steve and Ashley and they wanted one hundred Oxy pills.
 To say he was shocked would be an understatement.
 He wanted to know how I did this and was I sure it was Steve, as well as numerous other questions.
 I told him that he had told me he didn’t want to know anything, and I preferred to keep it that way for now.
 I did give Officer White enough information so he was sure I had the right people.
 I just needed to know when and where the narcotics squad wanted to do this deal and what I needed to do next.
 The Officer was excited at the opportunity to get this guy and he arranged me coming to the police station so I could make the call to set up the one hundred Oxy pill deal on a recorded phone line.
 The drug deal itself would happen later and I would need to be evasive and the where and the when as to the actual exchange of money for drugs.
 I was told to call her from my phone and tell her I would call her tomorrow around noon.
 Chapter 18: Game Time I arrived at the station and was escorted to an interrogation room.

My instructor would start us out with the prayer and then we would meditative on our duty.” “For how long?” asked Imeralda.
 “Until you are sure of what your duty is,” Rodregas replied, hearing the voice of his old drill Knight Captain.
 All the instructors had been retired knights who enjoyed teaching the squires.
 He did not think the two would join him for this but both pulled their weapons and imitated his position, Doi’van with his large great sword balanced on his powerful arms, Imeralda grabbed her bow instead of a short sword, which with her lack of training was probably a good idea.
 Rodregas focused inwards and resumed his meditation.
 He was finding it wonderful to do the meditation again; Rodregas had a lot of good memories from his life as a squire, before everything had gone wrong.
 Part of him felt uncomfortable for doing this again, like he no longer had the right.
 But once you are raised from Page to Squire as he had been, you always got to keep the title of Squire.
 Squires who were not raised to knighthood were much sought after; their martial training and their education, especially in law and etiquette, were a great foundation for many careers.
 As Rodregas knelt on the ground balancing the sword across his arms, and the sun warm on his face, he thought back to that time when he had used his Squire title to get into the officer academy in the Ramig Empire.

Mother Earth!” I yelled.
 Blood trickled from the strike point.
 Ruby giggled.
 “Okay, we start slower.” She considered for a moment.
 “Maybe we work on your attacks instead of defense.” I relaxed my stance.
 “Um, I don’t really have any attacks.” “Well, then, I suppose we had better focus on getting you some.
 How to begin?” She was talking to herself now.
 My mind started to wander as I listened for sounds from the men below.
 What are they doing there?
 “I’m afraid we will have to use your anger,” she said, a smile creeping into the corner of her lips.

Everything went just like normal, and promptly at five I closed my binder and started stuffing books into my backpack.
 I looked up to find Rachel standing in front of my table.
 "Are you ready?
 James had to leave early, but don't worry, we've still got a ride home."
 I think I managed to keep the disappointment off of my face.
 Rachel at least didn't seem to notice.
 Somehow I'd lost track of the fact that it was a Wednesday, and Brandon therefore wouldn't be taking me home.
 "Great.
 Britney's been avoiding me like the plague.
 I didn't even see her leave today."

We're much more inclined towards ridicule and hasty, usually unfair, judgments.
 Still, something had changed.
 I held onto that hope right up until I saw Mrs. Sorenson joining everyone else in staring at me whenever I looked down at my book.
 There was no mistaking the look on her face; it was utter distaste, possibly with a dash of disdain.
 I was so tired of it all.
 By the time English rolled around my natural embarrassment had given way to actual anger at Britney for starting it all.
 She tried to catch me at our lockers in between classes, but I pretended not to hear her, and made it safely into Mr. Whethers' class before she could catch up.
 Part of me acknowledged how petty it was, but I avoided her attempts at a whispered conversation during class.
 Mr. Whethers unknowingly helped my cause, when he crossly silenced a couple of girls on the far side of the classroom.
 He was normally so even-tempered that even his moderate rebuke instantly shut them up.

“Not this lady.”
 “Never said you were one, elfie.”
 Aurelia gave Harruq a brutal glare.
 “And why not?”
 He picked at some grass and said nothing.
 “Well?” she asked.
 “Well what?” He looked up, his face blank and his eyes wide as if he hadn’t a clue.
 “Why am I not a lady?” Aurelia asked.
 “I don’t know,” Harruq said.

Why I’d wanted to learn transfer magic… to get my mother’s things.
 The look he’d given the pendant on my neck… my mother’s pendant.
 Of course he’d volunteered to be my watcher.
 I had taken everything from him.
 My thoughts began to muddle as my mother and my dreams and my own life twisted together.
 I still couldn’t retrieve my memories; I only had the last years, which seemed a haze now.
 The only parts clear to me were the days since Chevelle walked through Junnie’s door.
 I thought of how I had cursed him when I’d found he was my watcher.
 The hate in my voice when I’d demanded my memories back.
 The memories of his family’s murder.

Instead they'd passed her up and then declined to make a beeline to Cassie either.
 When they'd started handing the flowers to me, I'd tried to convince them there'd been some kind of mistake.
 The sound of 'One Day More' playing on the cell phone nestled in the closest bouquet had been what finally convinced me it was all meant for me.
 Brandon's voice had been like silk caressing my face when I'd answered the phone.
 One minute I was minding my own business trying to pretend like I didn't notice the nasty looks some of Brandon's friends were shooting my way when they thought I wasn't looking, the next I was going to the biggest dance of the year with the most popular guy in school.
 I'd half thought Cassie was going to rip out my throat.
 I walked past a pair of gorgeous, gold-fringed drapes, handed my ticket to a distinguished-looking man in a uniform, and then smiled as he pointed me towards my door.
 It was almost a relief to be around strangers again.
 He'd been polite, but hadn't tried to fawn over me.
 My being asked out had changed my treatment from almost every girl at school.

The memories of my mother were fuzzy, but I’d always thought she’d had light hair, beautiful and golden like Junnie’s.
 In the dreams, it was black… as black as the roots of my hair were now.
 I stood there for a long moment, staring at the darkness, and then spun as I made another stupid, rash decision.
 Slinking past Fannie’s room, I headed for her makeshift vault.
 She kept all the things I wasn’t allowed to touch in that room; it was supposed to be off limits.
 Not that I’d bothered trying much, because there was a large flat stone—covering where it hid in the floor—that I’d never been able to move.
 But that was before.
 I wasn’t sure how the magic had worked with the bird, but I knew it had, so I dropped to my knees, held my hands above the stone, and closed my eyes, concentrating with everything I had.
 Nothing happened right away, and my mind wandered a bit with thoughts of what might be inside, how I wanted to see and needed to touch my family heirlooms.
 The things that belonged to my mother.

When I confronted him, he denied it, and even went so far as to blame Brandon and Bryce.
 He threw his nephews under the bus to cover his ass.
 Another rift between us.
 I had to protect my boys.
 In their teenage years, Brandon and Bryce were as different as perfect strangers and they were becoming young men.
 As they began to become more independent from me and from each other, they became interested in different things.
 I tried to accommodate them as individuals and stay close to them.
 I tried my damndest to embrace each son and his hobbies and desires equally.
 Bryce began to love golf, so we played golf often and eventually joined a country club so he could play as often as he liked.
 In the summer, he would spend entire days at the club, soon becoming a great golfer and playing four years on his high school team.

Information Empowerment: The poor quality, slow speed and inadequate reach of extension services is the bane of farming in many developing countries.
 ICT can be harnessed to provide farmers with access to state-of-the-art technical advice, quality inputs and market information.
 The proper analysis and replenishment of soil nutrients by itself can double or triple crop yields.
 Utilizing ICT, it is possible to deliver custom-tailored instructions for soil improvement in a timely manner at low cost.
 It can help to promote quality and trade literacy among farm women and men.
 Organizational Linkages: In much of the developing world, agriculture suffers from intense fragmentation of land holdings among small and marginal farmers.
 These farmers tend to have lower levels of education, poor access to technology for upgrading productivity, less access to quality inputs and credit, poor access to storage and processing facilities, and higher losses due to post-harvest crop spoilage.
 Their problems are further aggravated by environmental degradation due to soil erosion, deforestation and depletion of water resources.
 Lack of effective organization and management is a common denominator linking all these deficiencies.
 More effective forms of organizations can eliminate or compensate for these deficiencies to a large extent.

I fielded something like a hundred questions about school, reassured her two or three times that she wasn't a terrible mother, and promised yet again to stay one hundred percent out of trouble while she was gone.
 I was beginning to wonder if I was ever going to get off the phone when she finally decided, ultra-late shoot tomorrow or not, she'd better go to bed.
 By the time I finally finished up the rest of my studying, decided I was ready for my catch-up test in Mrs. Campbell's class tomorrow, and spent a few minutes with Rachel, I was well and truly exhausted.
 I thought about going back to the Lilac Room, but it would've just been because I was worried about what everyone else was thinking.
 I'd been raised to believe good little girls didn't spend the night with boys.
 Not even boys who were so gentlemanly it was sometimes painful.
 I still believed that, but my desire to be with Alec had devoured the parts of my brain that used logic and reason to decide things.
 I wanted to be with him while he slept, even if it was only for a couple of hours.
 Everyone in the pack already knew I'd spent the night.
 In the end, the reasonable part of me never had a chance.

Jasmin completely ignored me as she climbed into the car; Isaac gave me a polite, if somewhat cool nod.
 The Hispanic girl gave me an honest-to-goodness smile as she slipped behind the steering wheel and started the engine.
 In what was one of the most thoughtful things that'd happened all night, she turned the heater on full as she pulled out of the driveway.
 The drive into town, and then back out to my house was quiet, but luckily didn't take as long as normal.
 Apparently her timidness stopped well short of observing the speed limit.
 Alec, Isaac, and Jasmin all jumped out of the car as soon as my house was in sight.
 The car was still doing at least twenty miles per hour when they bailed.
 They faded into the darkened landscape about the time we rolled to a stop.
 I went to open the door, but a delicate brown hand stopped me.
 "I'm sorry you've had such a rough night.

Alec's hand on my shoulder just made me try to roll away.
 I didn't want his pity.
 Not after everything else he'd already done for me.
 Guilting him into helping me more just felt wrong.
 He captured me in his iron grip, stopping me from getting up and running away.
 "Adriana Paige, it isn't that I don't want to be with you.
 I want it more than anything else right now.
 That's why I'm not sure it's such a good idea."
 His face had somehow gotten so close to mine that I could see his eyes, and they were dead serious.
 I'd never noticed how clear his eyes were.

In sub-Saharan Africa, gross primary enrolment will have to double before year 2000 to achieve this goal.
 In addition to the quantitative deficiency in educational enrolment and achievements, the quality of teaching facilities, materials and staff is severely deficient in many countries.
 Most developing countries hire teachers with only a secondary school certificate and a minimum of teachers’ training.
 This contributes to the high rate of primary school drop-outs and grade repetition.
 Only 71 per cent of first-grade entrants complete primary school in developing countries.
 Addressing these challenges will require a substantial increase in financial resources devoted to education.
 In most regions, public expenditure on education has risen in recent years.
 In 1990, the world average was 13.5 per cent of total government expenditure, or 4.8 per cent of GNP.
 More than one-third of the countries in the world still spend more on the military than on education.
 Efforts to improve education must go hand in hand with efforts to promote peace and disarmament and drastically curtail military spending.

 Alvrik laughed.
 He nudged the man next to him, who grabbed the quill.
 “Give me your name,” he asked, dabbing the tip into the ink.
 “Harruq,” he said.
 “Harruq Tun.”
 “Well, Harruq,” Alvrik said, slowly nodding his head.
 “I’ll see you right here at sunrise tomorrow.
 Got that?”
 Harruq grinned ear to ear, even his nervousness unable to diminish his excitement.

 "No!"
 She began crying so hard that she became ill and had to jump up and run to the bathroom.
 Rick got up and followed her.
 He wet a washcloth for her and one for himself.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart," he said, handing her a washcloth as she straightened.
 "I should keep all these disturbing thoughts to myself."

Evolve new organizational patterns for existing industries based on adaptation of new technologies in small, geographically decentralized, labour-intensive production units in order to make these industries more responsive, flexible, efficient and competitive.
 8.Extend basic education: A distinguishing feature of the East Asian countries has been their emphasis during the early stage of industrialization on primary and secondary education, especially in rural areas.
 This strategy increases the productivity of the mass of the workforce, helps promote income equality, consumer spending power and broad support for high growth and pro-business policies.
 Raise the educational qualifications of the workforce to the level pertaining in more economically advanced nations.
 Place particular emphasis on primary and secondary education, rural education and education of young girls.
 9.Disseminate information: Encourage the establishment of new institutions, programmes and systems to speed and extend the dissemination of practically useful information as a powerful catalyst for more rapid social progress.
 Encourage a national climate of open-mindedness to foreign ideas, influences and success stories.
 10.Increase the velocity of money and other transactions: Increase the speed of commercial transactions, especially money flows, in the economy by streamlining government and banking procedures, ensuring rapid utilization of funds by all government agencies, setting strict limits on the time taken for bank transfers, introducing agencies for credit verification and collection of unpaid bills, and improving the telecommunications infrastructure.
 11.Revamp higher education: Educational systems which 'manufacture graduates' compound the problem rather than alleviating it.
 The problem of the educated unemployed is not so much the amount of education they receive, but the type of knowledge and attitudes imparted.

She managed to doze a little but was wide awake before dawn.
 Deciding to do an aerobics tape until it was light enough to walk in the garden, she put on her workout clothes and went downstairs.
 She didn't know how she was going to be able to wait two entire days.
 She was so excited that she felt like she could run all the way to Hollywood.
 After 45 minutes of aerobics, she still wasn't tired!
 She wouldn't be able to sit still and watch TV today.
 She'd do all their laundry and clean the house from top to bottom and have dinner ready when Rick got home.
 She glanced at her watch and decided to get everything ready for breakfast so that it wouldn't take long to cook it for Rick as soon as they got back from her walk.
 She froze in place.
 What if she got back to 1927 today?

Jim – (hands him a comic book) Sumo Assassin?
 Johnny – What do you think that’ll help?
 Jim – I find Skinny’s antics to be uplifting in times of sorrow.
 Well except for the time that he managed to run himself over with the Sumo-mobile.
 That was depressing.
 Johnny – How did he do that?
 Jim – Well he’s not the brightest side-kick out there.
 Johnny – Then why does would anyone keep him around?
 Jim – A couple reasons, first he can fit into places that a five hundred pound sumo wrestler would never be able to go.
 That and well just look at his costume.

"How?"
 He laughed.
 "I have no idea."
 After listening to the water in the machine for a few moments, she turned to Rick with a shy smile.
 "Can we watch a picture?"
 "What kind of picture?"
 "What kind are playing?
 I like romances more than anything."
 "Oh--you mean a movie.
 Let me think."

"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you."
 Strangely enough, I believed him.
 He was moving with the same, over-controlled care I'd seen him use around Rachel.
 "It's okay, it must be really limiting to always have to pretend you're slow and normal."
 His expression took on an alien cast, as he shrugged.
 "Actually I've spent so much of my life trying to hide the unusual aspects of my nature, it's usually effortless.
 For some reason, I forget myself around you."
 There was something to his voice, but even after he'd hinted at having strong feelings for me, it was hard to really believe it all.
 At least not without an outright admission on his part.
 Seeking to distract myself from a thoroughly useless train of thought, I looked around, trying vainly to pierce the curtain of black hanging around the feeble circle of light.

I wormed my way blindly up his leg, intent on getting the information I needed.
 They’re getting closer.
 They’ve found us a third time now.
 They’ll kill us.
 I wanted to free my mind, free my bonds.
 They won’t take me.
 Something about that last thought didn’t seem right, like it wasn’t mine, but I couldn’t follow it.
 The tracker screamed; it had reached his thigh.
 My eyes flicked open.
 The body of the snake made a lump under the skin of the tracker’s leg.

In order to get far enough not to be busted by the cops we have to go really remote.
 There isn't any way my car would make it where we need to go.
 We're headed to Vincent's to hitch a ride in his truck."
 'Truck' turned out to be an understatement.
 I'd marveled more than once since getting to Utah, at just how big some of the pickup trucks I saw driving around were.
 It seemed like nobody was willing to drive anything around the way it came off of the showroom floor.
 Everything had bigger wheels, and suspension that lifted it up several inches.
 Vincent's truck had more in common with the beasts in monster truck rallies than it did with the souped-up vehicles I'd seen driving around town.
 The tires were the biggest I'd seen on anything outside of a tractor, and the lift kit on it was so outrageously tall that I was pretty sure someone was going to have to lift me into the cab.
 By myself it was going to take a rope and climbing shoes.

I was trying to figure out who had lifted it when Grey flashed back into view, hesitating only a moment as he considered the rock.
 At once, his face changed; he knew he’d been beaten.
 As he’d paused to study the floating rock, Steed had immobilized him and, just like that, the match was over.
 Ruby leaned into me, voice soft.
 “Steed is stronger than Grey.
 He only needed to catch him.” Grey conceded, his walk slower, movements no longer jerky as he made his way out of the makeshift ring.
 Steed threw me a quick wink.
 Anvil approached next, stepping into the same starting position Grey had used, and Steed shifted several paces back before he readied himself and nodded toward his new opponent.
 I remembered the tree and was suddenly afraid for him.
 Would Anvil use the same method on a person?

I turned to ask Donovan what to do next, only to have the words torn away from me as a surge of power washed over me from where Dominic had disappeared.
 A momentary ripple of stillness swept through the pack, and then Dominic reappeared, this time walking on two legs.
 I'd been too overwhelmed by everything else to really register the fact that everyone was wearing some form of stretchy clothing.
 I'd never thought about how changing shapes must make for difficulty when it came to clothing choices, but it appeared someone had solved the problem.
 Dom's black outfit had perfectly matched her fur, and whatever it was, it had shrunk down to fit her four-legged form, while still having enough elasticity to expand out to cover her person shape.
 The girl's clothes had an elastic band of some kind at their necks, legs and arms, while the boys were wearing a pants-like number which cinched down over their waist, as well as just above the knees.
 My preoccupation over what everyone was wearing gave Dom a chance to cover the distance between us.
 Donovan smiled as Dom reached us.
 "I'll leave her in your care then, Mistress Sanchez?"
 Alec watched Donovan leave, and then turned back to the pack and chivvied them back into motion.

He tilted her chin up to look at her anxiously.
 "Did I hurt you?
 What did--" "No, no--you didn't hurt me."
 She caressed his cheek.
 "But what if you did?
 What if you kissed me so hard that-that my teeth cut my lips?
 What if--" "I would never, ever hurt you."
 He caressed her hair.
 "If I ever do anything that hurts you or that you don't like, tell me, and I'll stop.
 Right away.

Eric didn’t need absence slips.
 If he returned to school after an absence and told the attendance clerk he’d been out with the one-day variety of bubonic plague, she would have excused him rather than phone his mother to verify.
 When anyone from the school called Sylvia, she might hold the person on the phone for an hour, ranting about their misdeeds.
 I have two pictures of Eric.
 His senior picture, given a full page in our senior-year annual, a head shot of keen blue eyes with thick lashes, freckles, and sandy hair, a chin square as Dick Tracy’s, an easy grin that would have wrongly convinced you he was loaded with confidence.
 And the one Sylvia called the “Jesus body picture” a snapshot somebody took in the locker room.
 Eric in a jock strap, beaming, his legs and arms spread as though to greet a familiar angel.
 Eric was superman.
 Strong, handsome, understanding, considerate, creative, vital, and brilliant.
 It was Eric who brought home Bertrand Russell’s Why I Am Not a Christian.

Fruitless, really, to pursue it.
 But, you know, Dylan sort of talked me into it.
 He hates the bootlegs, for good reason.
 If he’d wanted The Basement stuff out there, you know.
 But, I did get involved.
 At least it gives Pete something to do.
 There’s nothing more dangerous than a lawyer with time on his hands.
 Lessee, the other two cuts, are “Laurie Had Thighs Like Opinici” and “Melody Came as a Lichtenstein Painting.”  Two originals that I’ve never used.
 “Laurie” is a blues—a beat I stole from Fred McDowell—that almost makes it.
 The lyrics didn’t gel, I don’t think.

That was his mistake because while he was waiting, I had brought my hunting dagger down on him.
 I stood up and shook the heavy body off.
 I didn’t even have time to breath before one of the Thrashers decided that they would like to have a taste of me.
 I decided that I didn’t want to be shredded like some old rug, so I moved out of his path.
 That was the worst mistake I made, without even realizing it.
 At the same time another Thrasher was heading in my direction, and by moving out of the way from the first one, I had placed myself in the path of the second one.
 It slammed into my side at such a great force I tasted blood in my mouth, when I hit the ground.
 Then I felt pain, saw blood, and then nothing at all.
 Chapter 4
 I heard muffled voices around me as I regained consciousness.

 Jim – I dunno, He hasn’t been in a good mood since he found dad’s porn collection.
 Liz – Your dad collects porn?
 Jim – Well, ‘collects’ is a bit too strong.
 He did manage to acquire a huge pile of it though.
 Liz – I can’t believe that your mom would allow too have that sort of thing in the house.
 Jim – She didn’t, the pile just seemed to appear about six months after she left.
 Then it started to multiply.
 I think he was making up for a lot of lost time.
 A lot of lost time.

To look at a Celestial Beast made Rodregas wish he could write poetry like some noble in one of the high western courts; it made him struggle for words that he simply did not have.
 And what did this marvelous beast do?
 Rutted, gorged, and fell asleep ready for the slaughter.
 Rodregas could not help but shake his head at how life can show you miracles that made you want to live again, and that using the same miracle drives home the fact that there is truly no justice to existence.
 His eyes jerked back to Ravenhurr, as the sorcerer made a jerking motion, rising up from his sky tube.
 “Now,” he said and quickly repeated in his deep but smooth voice, “NOW!” Captain Poir, the leader of Ravenhurr’s guards, had stepped out of the shadows and approached the prisoners, but Rodregas stepped forward first and grabbed the half AElf maiden’s arm.
 With a quick twist of the key he removed her iron shackles but grabbed her arm hard so she could not run.
 “This way,” Rodregas said to her.
 As he separated her from the male prisoner he whispered to her, “If you want to live, don’t do anything until your circle starts to burn, then I will throw the club at the other guard.
 Run and make sure you get out of the circle.” She jerked towards him as he spoke and Rodregas was struck once again by the beauty of her amazing eyes, but he forced her forward hoping that she could think on her feet.

He did his best to dodge, but he was far less mobile than his brother.
 The arrow pierced between his left shoulder and collarbone, burying the barbed tip deep in his flesh.
 The half-orc let out a stunned gasp.
 He staggered right, clutching his shoulder as he slumped against the front of a home.
 “Qurrah!” Harruq shrieked, racing to his brother.
 Qurrah shoved away his clumsy attempts to examine the wound.
 “Kill him for me,” the necromancer gasped.
 “Go!
 He cannot live!”
 “But you’re bleeding real bad and…”

What had she said, until a pattern became noticeable?
 I shivered at the thought.
 “Poison.” He nodded in silent acknowledgement.
 “In the village, some of the elves never paired up.” I thought of Junnie’s family.
 “But I guess most of those had received the calling.” Grey scoffed ahead of us.
 I hadn’t realized he could hear us.
 I was embarrassed, but couldn’t stop myself.
 “What?” His horse slowed to fall in with ours as he spoke.
 “The calling?” I didn’t understand.
 It had been a thing of honor, but he spoke of it as if it were a joke.

The perfumed man in the center shook as he realized combat was about to erupt.
 “It is seven against two, you stupid pigs,” he shouted.
 “What are you thinking?”
 “That you will die last,” Qurrah said before casting his first spell.
 The fire in the center of the camp flickered and then died.
 The half-orcs, through their mixed blood, could see well in the darkness.
 The humans had no such natural ability.
 Until their eyes adjusted to the moonlight, the only thing they could see was their burning red eyes, the demonic glow of Harruq’s blades, and the fire that burned but did not consume Qurrah’s whip.
 In that darkness, they were demons of another plane, furious and merciless.
 The men fought but their hearts were afraid.

We slept in our car near a park on the far side of a rundown neighborhood from the French Quarter.
 For food and spending money, we foraged for soda bottles and redeemed them.
 With my share, I bought just enough beer so the proprietor of a smaller Bourbon Street bar allowed me to remain on a stool from which I admired a certain barmaid.
 She reminded me of Karen Flagstad.
 Not in her looks.
 She was taller and red haired.
 But in her expression, I read the same message I got from Karen’s sweet face.
 It said, I’ve been hurt bad and know how it feels so I’ll be nice to everybody and try not to make anybody else feel that way.
 A thousand and some miles from home, I was lonely enough to once again ache for a best friend.
 So while I admired this barmaid, who looked about three months pregnant, I dreamed she and I would roam until we discovered the right small town, where we didn’t know anybody.

She was also much more fragile than either Doi’van or Rodregas; a blow that would only stun the two of them would shatter her.
 Her incredible magic power would do her little good in a stand up battle.
 For all of that she gave a nod; she was willing to follow his lead.
 If he wanted to attack, she would follow them.
 How could someone so young and inexperienced be so brave?
 How could he not honor such bravery?
 Rodregas looked into Imeralda’s eyes.
 She had been watching him.
 There was no need for words, no argument.
 The decision was made, they only need direction.

The boy fell, dying in four pieces.
 Jeremiah knew then he would enter the golden eternity before the dawn.
 Someone swung a torch while another man thrust his short sword.
 The half-orc shattered the sword with a savage swipe while ignoring the torch as it smashed across his leather armor.
 He roared as he chopped that man’s head into pieces.
 The dropped torch sputtered and died.
 All the courage he could muster failed to move Jeremiah forward.
 He watched the raging warrior butcher friend after friend, so many having never seen their eighteenth winter.
 Harruq tore a neck open, punctured the same man three times, and then gutted another who had closed the distance.
 The man died after his final slash passed an inch from the half-orc’s skin.

“Okay, okay,” I shouted.
 “Let me up.” Chevelle’s camouflage dissipated and he stared down at me, disappointed.
 I smirked.
 “Where’s your horse?” He smiled as the beast nipped at the back of my head, yanking my hair.
 Grumbling, I swatted the horse away and ran my hand over my face, sure it was mottled with bruises and scratch marks.
 “Drink this.” Chevelle offered me a hide flagon and I took it, swallowing a mouthful before the taste hit me.
 “Gah, that tastes like cat pee smells.” Chevelle chuckled.
 “It will help with the healing.” Why bother?
 I wondered.
 It would be another day of bombardment with mountain fixtures… maybe whole trees this time.

He was alive, and in a stronger, younger body.
 With the physical essence of the lion now part of his new body, and the magic of the sorcerer Ravenhurr, he would be an extremely talented person.
 That everything had gone so well was simply a god-sent miracle.
 He had rescued the maiden and killed the sorcerer.
 Of course the man's soul and intellect had been destroyed and a lion from the realm of the gods itself had been destroyed.
 It was far from a perfect victory, but Rodregas knew there were never perfect victories.
 He had had more luck in the last half hour than in his entire downtrodden life.
 Then, the next revelation hit him; maybe the Celestial Gods had answered his prayers.
 He had promised the Gods that if he lived, it would become his sworn duty to take down the Immortalists.
 Rodregas’ new heart seemed to stop for a moment at that thought and a chill ran down his body.

Spanish was as bad as history.
 Mrs. Tiggs turned on one of the Spanish TV channels within thirty seconds of class starting.
 Towards the end of the hour I finally started to come back out of my funk, so I put the last few minutes to good use reviewing vocabulary for the quiz on Tuesday.
 I felt a momentary surge of relief when class ended, but the feeling evaporated when I remembered I had to go to math tutoring.
 I grabbed my math book, and met an equally morose Britney at her locker.
 There are only so many times one person can say something sucks, and expect the other person to agree with them.
 Britney quickly used up her allotment of complaints, and then subsided into silence as she led the way to an out-of-the-way corner of the old school.
 I'd noticed Britney liked to position herself so she was closest to the middle of the hall.
 Admittedly, dodging all the people trying to get into their lockers wasn't much fun, but I suspected her real motivation was a desire to ensure she could see and be seen, which was much more easily accomplished by relegating me to the outside position.
 Normally I'd have just viewed her theatrics with amusement, but it'd been a long day and I wasn't in the mood.

"All right."
 Arm in arm they returned to the living room and sat on the sofa.
 "Can you tell me anything about what happened, darling?
 If you were hurt or starved?"
 Marie sighed, wishing she could tell her mother everything.
 But she'd think that Marie had been so traumatized that she'd lost her grip on reality.
 "I wasn't hurt or starved.
 In fact, I was treated very well."
 She pressed her lips together.
 "I accidentally ended up far away from home and couldn't get back.

Rachel's soft blue eyes got really wide as she recoiled slightly.
 Whatever she was about to say was preempted as we were both thrown forward in our seats.
 James slid the car through a one-eighty turn that left us facing the direction we'd just come from, only a couple of feet from the start of our lane.
 "You're not making her walk!"
 It was obvious that whatever magical ability had allowed Rachel to face down the larger boy wasn't working anymore.
 He looked like he was set for a monster fight.
 "I'm not washing my car again."
 I expected Rachel to back down as soon as she realized he was spoiling for a fight, but if anything she looked more determined.
 It was hard to believe this was the same person I'd had to rescue from Cassie so recently.
 I stopped Rachel just before she could put the impressive lungful of air she'd just taken in to whatever use she'd planned.

His sheer will would determine the full strength of the spell.
 A cold wind came blasting in, seemingly from all directions.
 Faster and faster, the words poured from Qurrah’s pale lips.
 Harruq braced himself as his hair fluttered before his eyes.
 The spell neared completion, and Velixar hissed in sheer pleasure at the power flaring from his apprentice.
 Qurrah shrieked out one final word, the signal, the climax of the spell.
 “ _Rise!_ ”
 All around corpses staggered to their feet.
 “Qurrah,” Harruq stammered but could say no more.
 “Eight,” Qurrah gasped, dropping to his knees.

Well I got you out and you helped me avoid all of the stupid questions everyone would've asked, so we're even."
 There was another flicker of something I couldn't quite read in Alec's eyes, but I was long past caring.
 I turned and limped off, wishing my ankle was in better shape so I could properly stomp.
 Spanish arrived much too soon.
 Since I hadn't gotten in trouble wandering the halls so far, it was a definite temptation to skip the last hour of school too.
 Unfortunately my luck was bound to give out sooner or later, and then I'd be in even more trouble.
 The last thing I needed was a record of delinquency to go along with my failing grade in Biology.
 Mrs. Tiggs was positively glowing as we all walked into her classroom.
 She popped out of her chair as soon as the bell rang, and began handing out graded tests.
 My world started trembling as I turned my test over and saw an 'F' at the top of the page.

Before the aide had even finished whispering, Mrs. Campbell was out of her chair and headed towards the door.
 Thirty seconds later we were all still looking around and wondering what had happened.
 It was a testament to our respect for, or in some cases fear of, Mrs. Campbell that nobody spoke in anything above a whisper for an entire five minutes.
 Every terrible thing that could possibly happen to a person flowed through my mind, and all I could do was hope I was overreacting.
 Mrs. Campbell had scared me a little that first day, but she'd been pretty nice since, and she'd always been fair.
 "So what do you think happened?"
 "Britney, what are you doing?"
 "What?
 You finished up your homework already and she left.
 We can totally talk right now.

"Growing up surrounded by this, and neither you or Rachel play an instrument?"
 Alec shook his head.
 "I've never had the finesse to play anything.
 Rachel took violin lessons for more than a year.
 I think she wanted to be able to play with mother.
 That was when she begged me to wire the house for sound.
 Donovan and I spent two weeks setting up mics in Mom's studio, and then another couple of weeks running sound into every other room of the house.
 She kept insisting it was so she could monitor Mother on the rare occasions when nobody else was home, but I used to hear her trying to play along to 'Courtship'."
 The trace of a smile on Alec's face lulled me into a false sense of security.
 "She doesn't play now though.

Would you say that you are seeking innocence with your recent work, that you are moving toward artlessness?
 BG:  	You would say that.
 I think you just did say that.
 Artlessness?
 Hm.
 I wouldn’t have used that word, but I like it.
 Yes, strip off the artifice, cut off the fat.
 Too many rock lyricists—you can think of them as well as I can, say, that guy with Procol Harum, or that Emerson Lake and Palmer shit, or some of Jim’s stuff, which, to be honest, I can’t stomach, all that lizard king shit—they’re purposely making with the lit-rock attitude, you know?
 They want you to study their lyrics.
 I mean, “An idiot reigns in the ancient trees of the night,” or whatever the hell he says.

The New American Standard’s version is, “Therefore, to one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it, to him it is sin.” Put these translations together, they insist that to do good is the right thing and what we ought to do.
 But even in consort, they don’t explain why we ought to do good or why we should avoid sin.
 We could infer we should do it because God said so, but to some of us, that answer feels unworthy.
 Pastor Ed Noble suggested an answer that rings more complete.
 The word translated "the right thing" or “the good” or what we “ought to do” is the Greek kalos in the accusative case, more naturally translated as "beautiful".
 So what we ought to seek is "the beautiful" or "to do the beautiful".
 One reason I would rather seek the beautiful than the good is because I can know with more confidence when I have encountered it.
 When I first read the John Keats poem, “Ode on a Grecian Urn” I got both enthralled and challenged by the lines “Beauty is truth, truth beauty.
 That is all we know on earth and all we need to know.” I believe those words are inspired, expressing deep though mysterious wisdom.
 Bible translators may avoid the word "beauty" because too many readers might interpret in ways akin to the ’60s motto, “If it feels good, do it.” In my vocabulary, "beautiful" describes a harmony that suggests the eternal.

Fuzzy, wrong.
 Nothing worked.
 None of it connected the way it should have.
 It made me angry and tired and the maddening fight against it gained me nothing but a buzzing headache.
 I sighed and threw myself on my blankets away from the group.
 It was still daylight and I tossed and turned, unable to rest.
 I decided to go back to my favorite distraction.
 The time came sooner than any of us expected.
 Looking back, I suppose it was fortunate.
 I can’t imagine what might have happened if a full birth ceremony had been prepared, if so many had been present.

It was too good to be true.
 I almost looked over at him, but I knew I'd lose myself in a pair of soft, gray eyes.
 Brandon seemed to understand that my silence meant I wasn't convinced.
 "You wouldn't believe how relieved I was when you stepped forward and stopped her before things got out of hand."
 My natural pessimism reasserted itself, undaunted by the fact that I could just see Brandon's exquisitely-muscled arm out of the corner of my eye.
 "If you knew Cassie was in the wrong, why didn't you stop her?
 She's your friend; you should have been able to defuse the situation before it got that far."
 Brandon took a deep breath.
 His voice was quiet now, the perfect example of someone admitting something they weren't proud of.
 "Things are complicated with Cassie.

I mean, I was about five and my parents had this set of records, this Reader’s Digest set, and there was this one song that I fell in love with on it, used to go around the house, scatting it, at five.
 It was “I Can’t Get Started” by Bunny Berigan.
 I don’t know.
 I can still play that one.
 CM:  	So, you grew up in a musical house?
 Music was part of your everyday life?
 BG:  	(laughs) Shit, no.
 Why would that follow?
 I mean, we had this console thing, whatever the hell they called them, big as a basilisk, a monstrous thing that had a radio and record player.
 I used to lie on the couch in the dark and listen to FM 100 on that thing—my parents, well, if they thought about what I was doing at all, probably thought it was better than TV.

She held nothing back in her kiss, making him hungrier for more.
 He pinned her to the car, pressing his body full length against hers.

 incredibly .

 She moaned, letting her head drop back against the roof of the car as he began kissing her neck.

It appeared to be mostly their equipment plus miscellaneous pieces of slaver gear.
 Doi’van stood watching, clearly not sure what to make of it.
 When Rodregas tried to apologize Imeralda ignored him and instead said, “We traded the Immortal Guard equipment for safe harbor here at the village for healing.
 But, of course, there were also regular slaver guards and I claimed their equipment and any money that was in their personal money pouches.” “Your armor got pretty chopped up,” she continued, “and Doi’van did not have any armor to start with.
 I have been trading excess gear and coins to repair armor and to refit some of the other armor to fit Doi’van and yourself.
 We still had our three horses, but none of them were too great to begin with; the two were good for pulling carriages, the other was too old.” “True,” Rodregas said nodding his agreement.
 “Jordaan knows horse flesh,” she went on, “and we were able to trade the three old horses for one of the Immortal Guards’ horses.
 I will be honest, he is a big ugly brute and not war trained and his Dire blood is marginal.
 But Jordaan thinks he can actually handle Doi’van’s weight.
 The Nymphs were not that interested in keeping him because for a Dire steed he is slow.” Doi’van said, “A steed that can handle me?

One of the chaperons, an over-bleached woman who looked like she was struggling to deny her last eight or nine birthdays, had to call my name at least twice to shake me out of my funk.
 I followed everyone else out to the bus, but there wasn't any refuge there.
 I was just too different from everyone else.
 Hour after hour passed in silent misery, until finally the rest of the kids wore themselves out and it quieted down enough for me to lapse into a fitful sleep.
 I was smack-dab in the middle of a dream about Rachel and Britney when everything changed.
 Ever so slowly, the normal dreamscape took on a sharp-edged glow, and then morphed into the breathtaking colors that'd wormed their way even deeper into my heart than I'd realized.
 I didn't recognize my surroundings, but they were different than any of the places I'd been before.
 The new scents whipping past me on the breeze were sign enough even if I hadn't been able to detect the subtle differences in the light emanating off of the foliage paving the trail I was walking along.
 For the length of the dream I lost myself in the wonder of experiencing the world in all of its amazing depth.
 Still, even the pure delight in my surroundings wasn't enough to mute the feeling something was missing.

In fact, I heard that it smells very familiar to you.” Rodregas immediately felt ice in his belly; he knew his hint at such knowledge was enough to turn Van’dret fully against him.
 The Immortalist’s eyes blazed with fury and Rodregas had no problem thinking that the Infernal Realms were reflected in those cold eyes.
 Strangely, it was the one who looked the part of an Infernal Daemon that broke the tense moment.
 Doi’van casually stood up and said, “This is the best I can do with this shield and here is your lance.” The Hellborn promptly handed Rodregas the items.
 As Rodregas sat on his horse juggling the gear Doi’van finished with, “Now stop teasing the nice Ambassador and go win a pretty ribbon.” His voice managed to be light and teasing even though it was deep enough to vibrate rock.
 Rodregas realized his best move was to go quickly, before the angry looking sorcerer could act, and he moved Doom Hoof around and into line.
 The judges seemed to pair up the contestants depending on the quality of the armor, either that or Doi’van got lucky.
 His first opponent’s armor was not much better than his own.
 As Doom Hoof plodded forward Rodregas was able to land a solid strike on his opponent’s shield.
 It was probably no less than the strike that he received in return.

I was being ridiculous.
 At this rate, I’d be fawning and flipping my hair like Evelyn by sundown.
 When I finally walked into the library, I remembered why I didn’t go there to study lineages.
 There must have been a thousand volumes and tenfold more scrolls in the main level alone.
 And I had no magic to lead me in the right direction.
 I went to the section which would most likely house the desired information, and then closed my eyes and concentrated.
 Maybe it wouldn’t work, but I could try.
 I wasn’t sure I felt anything, but after a few minutes I imagined my right hand might have tingled a little.
 I grabbed a close volume and leafed through it.
 It was a legacy of the Viridian Forest clan.

So, we didn’t do that.
 And we didn’t do Wattstax, either.
 (laughs)  It’s funny now, but, at the time, it seemed to sound some kind of death knell to us.
 Or maybe just to me.
 I felt marginalized, like we were from this backwater town and everything was happening elsewhere, like you know, how everybody in Memphis feels about New York, or it was San Francisco for a while.
 That inferiority thing.
 Of course, it’s only in retrospect that you see what Memphis had, what we had going on there, right around the corner.
 I mean, everybody wants to know if I know Elvis, you know.
 Everybody asks me that, everybody even in the business.
 He’s revered, and that’s right, that’s right.

My room became Raskolnikov's basement garret.
 If my mom dared enter to bring me a sandwich, I grabbed the plate, shooed her out, shut the door, and usually didn't bother to eat.
 Early in the novel Raskolnikov is in a tavern with a drunk, Marmeledov, whose daughter Sonia has prostituted herself for the money to feed her destitute step-mother and brothers and sisters.
 Marmeledov tells of a dream in which God sets straight the wise men who object to his accepting Sonia into glory: "Here is why, oh you wise, here is why, oh you of understanding—-her sins which are many are forgiven for she has loved much."
 I jotted the quote on a slip of paper and kept it in my wallet until it disintegrated.
 The only time in my rather lengthy existence I have so treasured an idea.
 Liz wanted more attention from me than I wanted to give.
 But we played fairly well together until, one Sunday evening, I wanted to go to a certain dance, which was held weekly and at which I always danced with other girls in addition to Liz.
 This time, Liz wanted me to myself, at her place.
 Her folks were out of town.

She seemed to have recovered, Rick mused as he watched her try on white sandals half an hour later.
 He never would have believed he could enjoy shopping, but he loved watching her discover new styles and new toys.
 He'd bought her a pocket calculator on the way to the shoe store.
 They were going to Teri's for dinner the next evening, and Marie showered and put on her new white dress and sandals when they got back from the shore.
 "How do I look?"
 she asked Rick when she joined him downstairs.
 "Beautiful."
 She was even darker than she'd been yesterday when she'd tried on the dress, and the contrast the dress made with her hair and skin was striking.
 "I can see where you two have been," Teri said when they arrived at her townhouse.
 "Yeah.

"Rick."
 She played with a curl on his forehead.
 He turned away from her hand, so she tickled his ear with her fingernail.
 His eyes finally opened, and he blinked up at her, smiling lazily.

 "Good morning."
 "Time to go walking in the garden?"
 "No--it's too late for that.
 I overslept.

These concerns motivated and were symbolized by the institution of the World Food Prize in 1987.
 It was in this context that, on World Food Day in October 1988, a small group met in Washington DC and proposed the launching of a new initiative to utilize the growing consensus over food to press for more rapid and substantial progress on peace, disarmament and development.
 Without peace there could be no stable basis or fertile soil for development, without development there could be no lasting and assured peace.
 The inextricable linkage between war and famine, economic dislocation and unemployment, violence and social in stability, fleeing refugees and migrating populations, high military spending and growing indebtedness argued compellingly against any uni-dimensional approach to resolving the problems of peace and development.
 In the rapprochement between the superpowers we saw an opportunity that demanded new perspectives, new attitudes and new approaches.
 In constituting its membership, the Commission has brought together a highly diverse group of political leaders, scientists, economists, government administrators and businessmen, drawn from industrial and developing nations, with a wide range of experience in presiding over government ministries, administrative departments and agencies, international development and research institutions, prominent non-governmental agencies and private companies.
 The first official plenary meeting of ICPF was held in Trieste, Italy, in October 1989, within a few days of the fall of the Berlin Wall.
 Over taken by the staggering pace of developments arising from the end of the Cold War, the world was being altered almost beyond recognition.
 Our ambition to slow the arms race appeared suddenly insignificant in the light of unfolding events.
 While we contemplated strategy, COMECON and the Warsaw Pact were breaking up, the USSR began to dissolve, democratic institutions began to spread, and command economies started transforming themselves into free market systems.

Still, I wasn't ready to go to sleep.
 It felt like he'd disappear if I closed my eyes.
 "So you don't need to sleep.
 What do you do with all the rest of your time?"
 Alec was close enough now that I could see his smile.
 It reached out and wrapped itself around me like a warm blanket.
 "Well, I do spend a fairly significant amount of time each day sitting in class.
 Kind of like someone else I know."
 "Unacceptable.
 I've added that up in my head, and you've still got several hours each day that you haven't accounted for."

Of this I have no doubt.” He shouted an order to Qurrah’s undead.
 The eight obeyed, marching out of town to join the rest of Velixar’s army.
 “I will take control now,” he said to his disciple.
 “In time, the burden of sustaining life in them will seem weightless.
 Until then, let me bear it.
 Look at me.”
 Qurrah did, his eyes red and his face wet.
 “Yes master?” he asked.
 No weakness tainted his voice.
 The man in black put a hand on either side of Qurrah’s face and drew him close.

Possibly the greatest strength of the Yugoslav programme is that it was of necessity conceived by people within the country rather than by foreign experts, and depended entirely on domestic resources and capabilities for its accomplishment, rather than on pleas for foreign assistance.
 Self-reliance released the creativity, generated the determination and mobilized all available resources to make the transition successful.
 It is too early to predict the eventual outcome in Yugoslavia, subject as it is to extraordinary external constraints on public policy.
 However, the initial evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that alternative approaches can and must be fashioned which are more comprehensive in scope, more balanced in implementation, more pragmatic in conception and less influenced by extreme ideological viewpoints.
 It is likely that further study of the Yugoslav model will reveal important applications not only for countries suffering from hyperinflation or the effects of radical transition, but for those carrying out more modest programmes fo economic reform.
 Recommendations for Accelerating Transition in the East
 Conditions within the 25 nations of Eastern Europe and Central Asia vary significantly enough to limit the scope for broad generalizations on strategy beyond the statement of principles presented in this chapter.
 However, there are a number of specific recommendations applicable to all or most of these countries that can be applied to accelerate the pace and ease the pain of transition.
 1.Generate consensus for the transition programme: The transition should be an expression of the will of the society for change and it should help generate greater unity and harmony within the society.
 Further attempts to put through any macro-economic reform package will meet with strong political and social resistance unless a national consensus on the strategy is arrived at beforehand.

 It looks like it’s just a bunch of broken pottery.
 Art – That I have not a clue.
 Is there a marker on it somewhere?
 Karen – Yes, there is.
 Art – What does it say?
 Karen – It’s called The Importance of Bubble Wrap.
 The explanation explains that it is the artist’s trip of self discovery with other mediums, including the written word.
 Really makes you think doesn’t it, she must be a genius, to go and do something like that.
 To take the mundane and make it art.

I was all the way out to the parking lot before I realized that I didn't have a way home.
 I was still trying to figure out what to do, when I heard the deep roar of a high-performance engine.
 Brandon was clear over at the other end of the parking lot, but somehow he saw me and flipped his car around.
 "You're looking just a little stranded."
 "That obvious?"
 His smile was just as radiant and reassuring as always.
 "Only to someone who happens to know your entire schedule, and who just saw what looked like Rachel and James leave without you."
 It was my turn to try and hide a trembling lip as I responded.
 "Rachel and I had a fight."
 Brandon turned his stereo down and motioned me around to the passenger seat.

In Japan and other dynamic Asian economies, the ratio between the bottom and top pay is as much as 5 or 10 times lower than in the United States.
 A highly skewed income distribution results in lower levels of overall demand, growth and job creation.
 Lopsided income distribution fuels speculative investment, more and more of which goes overseas.
 The average wages for production workers in the United States are the lowest they have been since 1967, with 18 per cent of full-time workers not earning enough to keep a family of four out of poverty, up from 12 per cent in 1979.
 Income redistribution in the industrialized countries requires structural adjustments similar to those which the West has advocated for developing countries.
 A 'maximum wage' law can be introduced, requiring firms to pay taxes on exorbitant executive compensation.
 Agenda for a Global Employment Programme
 Employment is a global problem that cannot be fully solved by individual countries in isolation.

The staff continued twirling, positioning Harruq’s hands further out of place.
 She used the awkwardness to gain further separation between them.
 Her hands ached from the force of every block and parry.
 Her breath was fast and shallow.
 Her hair, which she had failed to tie up before the fight, hung in wild strands before her face.
 She was beautiful, but Harruq did not see it.
 To Harruq, she was the young girl cradling her sister.
 Aurelia thrust her right hand forward, her fingers spread wide and stiff.
 Words of power poured from her lips, and without hesitation the forest obeyed.
 Vines shot from the earth and wrapped around Harruq’s arms and legs.

Why was he looking at me so intensely?
 But I had my answer: Because you keep staring at him, fool.
 It seemed to me Fannie always knew when I didn’t want to be bothered and went out of her way to ensure I was.
 I quietly entered the house, hoping to slip right into my room, but there she was, smack in the center of the sitting area, drunk as a two-day jamboree.
 She stopped me on my way through and forced me to sit, her audience.
 I watched her as she rambled.
 She had the same dull blonde hair and muddy-brown eyes as me, though my eyes were specked with green.
 After a long evening ducking her verbal jabs and listening to her theories on the Council’s secret conspiracies, I finally made it to my room.
 A flick of my fingers and light flooded the tiny space.
 I took a quick inventory: the seal on my wardrobe was intact, my drawings were still scattered across the floor, and the stash of cheese remained on the table beside my bed.

Every nagging doubt, every tiny part screaming for him to sheath his blades, he channeled into his mindless rage.
 His swords hacked chunks out of the staff, which held together only by Aurelia’s powerful enchantments.
 She blocked several attack routines but one finally slipped past.
 Her dodge too slow, a black blade cut across her cheek.
 She paused, rubbing her cheek as Harruq smirked.
 Blood.
 It was as she feared.
 Harruq’s weapons were enchanted.
 “Your spells won’t save you,” he shouted.
 “No elf will save you.

“Evelyn has been a model citizen… doesn’t seem right…” My nerves twitched as the worry from that day returned.
 As I remembered the risk I’d put myself under coming here.
 I strained to listen but could only pick out parts of the conversation.
 “Well on her way to becoming a Council member… if anyone should leave…” “Yes, but who can trust him…” “Why can’t we simply banish… who knows if the spells will even hold… dark magic can’t be trusted…” I was trying to hear them, irritated they were talking so low, and the harder I listened, the more I perceived a dull, buzzing hum.
 My ears popped.
 And then, at once, the group began to scratch at themselves feverishly, clawing at forearms, abdomens, and necks.
 Each wore an uncomfortable, even frightened, expression as they hurried out of the room and into an inner Council chamber.
 I was considering the strangeness of it as I made my way through the now-vacant room, but was distracted by the sight of the library door.
 I had no way of knowing if there would be a protection spell on the entry.
 When I walked through, there were no obvious repercussions and I assumed that, with so many Council members around, they must not have thought it necessary.

Such nuisances needed to be eradicated.
 “If given a choice,” Qurrah asked, “would you split a seed or burn a flower?
 Let the children meet their end before they learn the torment and anguish of their parents.
 Besides, kill a child and the mother has one less mouth to feed.
 Kill the mother or father and all the children suffer and starve.”
 The larger half-orc shrugged.
 He was not convinced but that mattered little.
 He would trust his wiser brother as he always had.
 Qurrah let his eyes drift back to the fire.
 “Tomorrow night, bring me a body, but don’t let yourself be caught.

I recognized Alec's humanoid form from before, a massive, black, heavily furred tower of muscle, claws and fangs.
 I might have pulled back at his approach, but the eyes, even with their vertical pupils were still undeniably his.
 A paler, more icy blue than I was used to, but it was still him looking out at me from the other side.
 Everyone else was harder to pick out, but I gave it my best shot.
 Isaac was probably the bluish-black hybrid who was nearly as big as Alec.
 His utter stillness in comparison to the constant motion of the rest of the pack was too much like his normal self-mastery for it to be anyone else.
 The other hybrid, the gray one with his teeth showing and just the barest hint of a growl had to be James.
 Jessica was obviously the smallest of the wolves.
 She paced back and forth, her eyes never leaving me as she made it entirely evident she'd like nothing more than to give into countless millennia of instincts, and just rip my throat out in a single lightning-fast bound.
 It wasn't until I tried to decide which of the two remaining wolves was Dominic, that I realized the next smallest figure wasn't a wolf at all.

He was no boy to put his own needs over another.
 “I agree, I cherish the time we have had together, but you must walk your own path.
 The Grimoires and Mithril chain and bow are yours to keep, my gifts to you.
 Your gifts to me are far greater.” “So where do you go now?” asked Imeralda.
 “You can’t look for slavers on the road; they will be reinforced after the one caravan goes missing.” Rodregas nodded.
 His thoughts had traveled in a similar direction.
 “I have been thinking about what you said about it making sense for me to get a greater sigil.
 I have more magic than I need.
 There is only one other group besides the Guild that has is allowed to give sigils, the Knights of the Soaring Heavens; from who the Gods choose their champions.” Imeralda and Doi’van had both become quite intrigued by what Rodregas was hinting at.
 He continued, “I was a squire in the Knighthood who was never raised.

“I’ll bet you would, I had a friend who sold his for a lot of money to a coworker,” I said.
 I still had my pants on when she offered to buy the Oxy.
 I noticed that she had left the door to the bedroom wide open and I wondered if someone was listening.
 I told her I was a “professional” and a “family man” and it just wasn’t worth the risk.
 She said she understood but if I changed my mind, she and her boyfriend would pay $25 per pill.
 I said thanks, but no thanks.
 She asked me to finish undressing and get on the bed for the massage.
 She stood directly in front of me, just a few steps away as I took off the last of my clothes and I stood there naked.
 I felt as if she stood there for me to prove l wasn’t a cop, who likely would leave at least his underwear on.
 She pointed to the bed that was now covered in a bright beach towel.

With public opinion widely divided over the best course of action, it is necessary to win back the understanding, support and endorsement of the population for an alternative programme which the major parties and social groups can back.
 This requires educating the public to understand both the costs and benefits involved in any reform strategy, the trade-offs between immediate advantages and immediate sacrifices required to establish a new and stable equilibrium.
 3.Economic strategy must be balanced: A market economy can be introduced gradually or step-wise, but it cannot be introduced in a fragmentary or piecemeal manner.
 Deregulation of prices was the most prominent feature of the strategy in most countries, because it was the easiest to implement.
 But under conditions of shortages in economies dominated by huge monopolistic enterprises, price deregulation led to skyrocketing prices and spiralling inflation.
 A market flourishes only when several essential conditions are met – freedom of pricing, freedom of entry and exit from industry, free flow of information, unrestricted movement of goods and services, competition between enterprises, control of monopolies, and private ownership of property.
 The entire package of free market practices must be implemented hand in hand, otherwise it does not work.
 Freeing pricing without first regulating or dismantling monopolies, promoting privatization of land and enterprises, ensuring free flow of goods, and establishing wholesale markets and multiple distribution out lets lead to speculation, soaring prices, hoarding and falling production.
 Historically, the free market evolved over centuries in conditions of surplus production and stable currency, neither of which exist in Eastern Europe today.
 Efforts to accelerate the development of the market will have first of all to meet the political, legal, social and economic conditions historically required for its creation.

Few developing countries – perhaps few countries at any stage of development – could have marshalled resources on such a massive scale and instituted such widespread changes so rapidly without heavy reliance on the government for both planning and execution.
 In the majority of developing countries, government is still the most organized and efficient agency and the only one capable of such significant initiative.
 In formulating strategies, it is essential to take fully into account both the stages and steps of the development process.
 At this stage in their development, it is highly unlikely that food-deficit African nations can make rapid progress toward food self-sufficiency without strong government support and investment to improve technology, training, techno-infrastructure and trade.
 Once the rural sector begins to exhibit its own dynamism, as in the majority of developing countries, there is strong justification for a shift in the role of government from that of prime mover, planner and controller of development to that of catalyst and pioneer.
 Government agencies can tap the potentials of agriculture, identifying new commercial opportunities, educating farmers, demonstrating new potentials, assisting in the transfer and dissemination of new technology, and promoting the establishment of effective organizations – preferably privately or co-operatively owned by farmers or at least with their participation – to process, distribute and market what is produced.
 Coping with the environmental problems to preserve the ecological foundations essential for sustainable agriculture is an area in which government has special responsibilities and must play a leading role on an ongoing basis.
 Regulating the diversion of prime farm land for non-farm uses, expansion of irrigation capacity, control of groundwater exploitation, major programmes for reforestation and to prevent or reverse desertification, and regulation of pesticide use can only be effectively planned, monitored and regulated by governments.
 Comprehensive Strategies
 In this and previous chapters, we have tried to present an integrated perspective of the political, economic and technological factors that need to be taken into account in formulating a comprehensive approach to the issues of peace, food and employment.

Jasmin's pretty lips drew back in something that looked almost like a snarl, and she'd tensed up so tightly she was almost shaking.
 For a heartbeat I thought Jasmin would launch herself at the other girl, but Alec reached over without looking, and grabbed her arm.
 A stocky, Middle Eastern-looking boy to Alec's right looked like he wanted to act as well, but he was looking at Alec, and an almost imperceptible headshake stopped him.
 I'd been so busy watching the byplay behind Rachel that I'd missed the last two exchanges between her and Cassie.
 Whatever had been said must have been bad though.
 Rachel was shaking, and the blonde looked like someone about to pull the wings off a butterfly.
 I could feel my heartbeat climbing, slamming away at my ribs with all the energy of a full-blown panic attack, but I wasn't dizzy, just scared.
 The cafeteria workers had all turned around so their backs were facing us, a sight which kindled the first spark of anger, an emotion that burned brighter because of the fear still coursing through me.
 There was a gasp as Cassie shoved Rachel, a misleadingly casual motion that sent the smaller girl stumbling back into Alec's chest hard enough to leave bruises.
 The typical catcalls were still absent, it was as if nobody viewed this as a normal fight, like there was somehow more at stake.

The chamber was large with a tall vaulted ceiling like some temple, but no rows of seats or prayer mats did this temple hold.
 Instead it was filled with beasts; lions and wolves and the great mythical animals of the Celestial Realm.
 Most of these he recognized as the great totems of the Celestial Realm, each representing great power.
 The great beasts were full-size and, but for their lack of movement, Rodregas would have thought that they must have traveled to the Celestial Realm itself.
 “Oh, my Gods, they look real.
 I thought they would be made of stone like the frog,” said Imeralda.
 Rodregas nodded.
 The beasts looked to be made of flesh and bone, except they all stood perfectly still on short stone pedestals.
 Strangely, the room did not smell of damp stone like the rest of the cathedral, but the air smelled of the outdoors in spring.
 Rodregas’ eyes were drawn to the powerful lion that reared up not far into the gathered animals, and just to the right of the center.

I felt the ground disappear underneath me as I woke up to the safety of the cave.
 I opened my eyes and had to squint because the light was so strong.
 I sat up and leaned against the wall, looking around.
 The sun shone brightly through the cave's entrance, making dirt particles appear in the air.
 Seth was leaning on the wall, twirling his sword in the dirt, not appearing to notice that I was awake.
 Emily and Jason were sitting in the center of the cave, playing some kind of hand game.
 Jason hit Emily in the arm and she started yelling at.
 So, this is typical thing to wake up to.
 I stood up and walked over to Seth.
 He looked up from the ground and saw my troubled face.

A couple of kids reached out, but the only people who could've really stopped him had already been bowled over.
 Time slowed down for me as he hit the railing and started over it.
 His feet came up and his torso was hanging in the void when someone reached over and grabbed his arm.
 I heard a grunt of effort, saw him stop moving, and only then realized it was Ben who'd nearly died.
 In the split second between Ben being gently placed back on the stairs, and everyone starting to breathe again, I followed the arm that'd saved him back to see who the hero was.
 Isaac met my gaze as he let go of Ben and then he looked up at Vincent with a stare that was somehow both calm and challenging at the same time.
 "What are you looking at, freak?"
 It was hard to believe Vincent could be so nonchalant after having almost killed someone.
 It'd been an accident obviously, but still that wasn't the kind of thing you just shook off.
 All of the kids that'd been rushing forward to congratulate Isaac for his heroic save started backing away.

After seeing how far behind I was already in Biology, it was nice to know we'd be working on something I'd already been through twice.
 On the other hand I hadn't liked the novel the first time I'd read it, and when I'd gritted my teeth and sat down for a second attempt I'd found I liked it even less.
 Maybe I just lacked the maturity to appreciate Bronte's so-called masterpiece, but I couldn't stand that her characters were almost all really nasty people.
 I wondered what else we'd be reading.
 I could always ask Britney, but the odds of her knowing anything useful seemed pretty slim.
 When the bell finally released us from an analysis of Heathcliff's early depravity, Britney asked what my next class was.
 She was elated to find we were both headed to Algebra.
 As we trailed the other students out of the class, I wasn't so sure I was equally enthused.
 Nobody had said anything to either of us.
 It was starting to look like Britney was receiving just as much of a cold shoulder as I was.

Then again, maybe burns wouldn't be so bad if they let me disappear into the anonymity of a large crowd in an actual city rather than dealing with hick hostility.
 "That sounds great; I can't wait to get out of this stupid town."
 A couple of people started a bit, and I heard a locker slam shut with surprising force.
 The eavesdroppers were predictably pissed I was dissing their home, but I didn't care.
 It served them right.
 Don't listen in if you aren't prepared to hear something you won't like.
 As long as my comments hadn't offended my new pseudo-friend, I was just fine.
 Britney laughed.
 "You said it.
 There is so nothing to do here.

I'd done web searches on my name and birth date before and never had it return anything legit, so he couldn't have found it out that way.
 Even that would've been an unheard-of level of effort coming from a guy, but however he really had learned it was my birthday must have been even harder than that.
 I felt like I was floating on a cloud as I hurried off to Biology.
 The feeling lasted exactly as long as it took me to sit down, listen to Mrs. Sorenson tell us all that she'd finished grading our tests, and then see the big, self-satisfied 'D' sitting at the top of my paper.
 For a second it felt as though my heart had stopped beating.
 I'd never done worse than a 'B' on any assignment or test since I'd finished up Kindergarten.
 I couldn't take this home and show my mom.
 Head in the clouds half of the time or not, she'd still freak out.
 Heck, I was already freaking out enough for the both of us.
 This was going on my high school transcript.

This scene repeated itself almost every night, and several times the cats also brought game they had killed into the farmyard.
 Rodregas made a point of always taking a piece of the kill, as for some reason he felt this was expected as part of their adopted group.
 Plus, it added fresh meat to their diet without the three having to go hunting.
 After awhile he started to take the presence of the Dire Cats for granted and stopped worrying about the danger.
 Several weeks later, came the first night where neither the cats nor Doi’van were in the room.
 Doi’van was out messing with the well, Imeralda was reading one of the magic Grimoires by the fireplace.
 Rodregas was supposed to be reading as well, but had lost his focus on the complex diagram and was just looking at Imeralda.
 She was so beautiful, slim yet curvy.
 Some of those curves were smooth muscle and some were pure female.
 She seemed to have brought together two of the most attractive parts of the AElves and the Nymphs: the slim athletic body of the AElf with the full curves of a Nymph.

They went home, but Rick couldn't read, couldn't rest, wasn't hungry.
 All he could do was think about how much he loved Marie, how desperately he wanted her to stay here and marry him.
 The thought of her walking through the garden, back into 1927, out of his life forever .
 .
 .
 He shuddered.
 "Are you sure you're feeling all right?"
 Marie asked him, having seen his shudder.
 "Maybe you had too much sun this weekend."
 She leaned over to feel his forehead.

I shouldn’t do it.
 I couldn’t.
 But I was.
 I was going to do it.
 And if I got caught?
 I could claim ignorance.
 The entire clan thought I was an imbecile in any case.
 Maybe I would just see how close I could get.
 Maybe just to try… And then I was there, standing in front of the Council building and walking in.
 My attempt at stealth was a poor endeavor, but no one ever seemed to pay much attention to me anyway.

“Bring me the head of the messenger.
 I will retrieve an elf to deliver it to the king.”
 The man in black stood and motioned to the stars.
 “Follow the left wing,” he said, his finger pointing to the constellation in the stars referred to as the raven.
 “It will not be long before you see the light of their campfire.
 Make haste.
 The battle grows closer with every move we make.”
 “Yes, master,” they echoed before beginning their trek.

“Just one god, Qurrah,” Velixar corrected.
 “All this by the hand of one.
 I am that hand.”
 Harruq stood and looked down.
 His arms and legs bulged with muscle.
 He flexed his arm and stared at the growth that traveled all the way up to his neck.
 He felt within himself a lifewell of energy, one infinitely deep.
 “Discard your swords, Harruq,” Velixar said.
 “You are the protector of my disciple.
 You deserve better.”

"I'll rub some on your back."
 "Oh."
 She hadn't even thought about that.
 He rubbed lotion into her smooth, flawless skin.
 She was so small that when he used both hands, they almost completely covered her back.
 He liked touching her, and he spent so much time rubbing her back that he was afraid she was growing suspicious.
 But she hadn't uttered a single word.
 Dropping a light kiss on her shoulder, he moved away.
 Marie felt drowsy with pleasure and wished he hadn't stopped.
 But as he stretched out beside her, she realized how very much she wanted to return the favor.

In the countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, the social institutions that served under the centralized command system need to be transformed out of recognition, or entirely replaced, in order to support a market-oriented system.
 Attempts at economic reform that focus primarily on changing laws and public policy without creating the necessary institutional infrastructure cannot succeed.
 Thousands of systems that have been fashioned by human resourcefulness are needed to support economic activity in different fields.
 The system of warehouse receipts enables American grain traders to purchase unseen crops with full confidence in their quality.
 The absence of this simple system retards trade on the recently established commodity markets in Russia and other CIS countries.
 A complete listing of essential institutions, small and large, should be compiled, based on the experience of other nations, and plans drawn up for introducing them.
 Thus far, the development of social organizations, like the development of technologies, has been partial, piecemeal and sectoral, leaving large gaps between parallel and interrelated activities and institutions.
 This is especially evident at the international level where the organization of the collective social life of humanity is rudimentary and fragmentary, though far more complete than it was a few decades ago.
 In spite of the phenomenal growth in global communications, transportation, commerce, finance and tourism, it is still more difficult to carry out most activities internationally than it is domestically, because the international activities are not as well organized.
 For instance, transfer of technology still involves a process that is largely trial and error.

"Oh--you mean a movie.
 Let me think."
 He didn't have a big collection of movies, and he didn't think it would be a good idea to take her out to rent one right now.
 "Why don't we see what's on television?"
 "The box?"
 "Yes."
 "Don't you watch talkies on it?"
 "Well, sort of.
 The programs aren't like movies--well, some of them are.
 Most programs are shorter--half an hour or an hour."

“Something’s wrong, Harruq.
 Tell me what bothers you so?”
 Harruq sighed and looked away.
 He gently tapped his swords together.
 “I don’t know.
 Bored.”
 “Am I not a challenge?”
 He made vague shrug that could be taken either way.
 Let her think that was it, he thought.
 It was a whole lot better than the truth.

Johnny – What was that?
 Jim – Just practicing for when we have to live under the rule of Canada.
 Maybe it won’t be so bad, I hear that the Canadians are a friendly nationality.
 Johnny – You’re weird.
 Eugene – I agree, you are weird.
 What Elizabeth sees in you I can only ponder.
 Jim – First of all those were perhaps the most ironic statements I’ve ever heard.
 It must be one of those instances of “takes one to know one.”  Secondly, I don’t know.
 I’m as confused as anyone as to why I’ve attracted Liz’s attention and kept it for all these years.
 But now that I know, I’m not going to complain.

I cast a spell upon his throat, filling it with ice.
 I watched him die and then I left that disgusting place forever.”
 “You were a worthy apprentice,” Velixar said.
 “Especially to learn such a spell on your own.
 Your master was blind.”
 “He was weakened,” Qurrah said.
 “Even the clumsiest of fighters can slay a sleeping man.”
 “How old were you then?” Velixar asked.
 “Nine,” Qurrah said.
 The man in black shook his head.

Chevelle took a step toward me and I was struck by fear.
 He must despise me.
 That was why he’d become my watcher.
 He gave a curt nod at my reaction, his head still dipped as he walked away.
 I wanted to speak but the words choked me.
 I wrapped myself tighter into the cloak as Chevelle constructed a hasty shelter.
 I was his responsibility, but surely he loathed me.
 How could he not?
 I thought back to the scenarios I had envisioned after the memories of my mother being killed came back to me… what I would do to those men if I were to ever find them.
 Now I remembered the truth.

He wore not the clothing of the knights but the robes of an Immortalist Sorcerer.
 Across his chest was a sash.
 Rodregas guessed him to be the Guild’s Ambassador to the Knights.
 Rodregas’ blood froze at the sight, though he did his best to remain casual.
 He knew that the Guild had a representative at the Cathedral but had not expected him to be so closely watching the registration table.
 Rodregas fell into old habits of survival.
 He kept his eyes to himself and let himself feel the tiredness of travel on the road.
 When it became his turn, Rodregas stood there silently.
 The knight, an older man with a short gray beard, who was missing his left hand, waved him forward.
 The Knight Captain slowly looked up at the tall figure before him and after a quick examination went to the oddly mismatched pair that stood at each shoulder.

It tasted of... Rodregas did not know what to call the flavor; the words that came to mind were sunlight and rain and the smell of a forest at night.
 When Rodregas finished the fruit completely he felt more whole but was also sad that it was gone.
 Imeralda seemed in great humor.
 “Come on,” she said.
 She dropped to her hands on the edge of the branch and then dropped down as if she was only feet from the ground which, strangely she was.
 Rodregas saw her standing on the ground.
 It was not that she had floated down.
 It was as if she had she had been in a regular sized tree.
 She smiled and waved at him to follow her.
 Rodregas decided to follow her example.

"She's one of the tutors.
 Patty Sanders, who I happen to know has Mrs. Campbell's class sixth period, just gave her a note.
 Stay if you want, but she's done exactly what she was supposed to."
 I wanted to give Rachel a big hug, or maybe just break into tears right then and there.
 I managed to just give her a smile, and hold off on the tears until I'd gathered up my stuff and made it out of the room.
 Rachel caught up with me before I made it very far.
 "Adriana, are you okay?
 Don't you want a ride home?"
 I turned towards her to respond and just broke down.
 She pulled me into an open classroom and gave me a hug while I tried to explain about the two failed tests, my birthday, and how much I missed my Dad and Cindi.

“How old a child?” he prodded.
 “Seventy.”
 “ _Seventy?_ ”
 The elf laughed.
 “Don’t be too shocked.
 You have elven blood in you as well.
 I wouldn’t be surprised if you lasted a couple hundred years yourself.
 This is assuming someone doesn’t kill you, which I find rather unlikely.”
 Harruq gasped at the thought.
 He had always felt akin to man and orcs, whose lives burnt out so quickly.

He held a torch in one hand and a shortsword in the other.
 At first, he had thought himself foolish waking in a full panic from a nightmare he could not remember.
 Then he saw others about, lit torches in their hands, and he knew his fear was justified.
 A young, fat-nosed farmer saw him awake and approached.
 “Couldn’t sleep either, Jeremiah?” he asked.
 “Aye, had the worst nightmares.” Jeremiah glanced at the sword in the farmer’s hand.
 “You feel the same, don’t you?”
 The farmer nodded.
 “Feels like the dark god himself is coming for us.
 Part of me wants to grab my children and run.”

Rick asked as he paid the bill.
 "I don't think so.
 I'm rather tired, and I think I'd just like to relax and think about all that happened today."
 "And dream about your debut?"
 He smiled.
 "We'll go see the movie as soon as it comes out.
 And buy the video when it comes out."
 He was thrilled when she didn't say she'd probably be back in 1927 before then.
 She was quiet during the ride home, remembering the scene she'd done.
 And how she'd peered through a camera.

 Johnny – Well you work as a Janitor, at least when you’re at school.
 You have a job where you wear your name on your shirt.

I gazed through the immense mass of leaves and branches overhead and breathed deeply.
 I felt the need to explain the welt, and my eyes rose toward him as I lightly touched my cheek.
 “I was searching for my mother’s things…” He didn’t respond, staring straight out into the meadow, so I returned to watching the canopy of leaves.
 “I can’t remember her,” I said.
 I hadn’t discussed this with anyone before, but once I started talking, I couldn’t seem to stop.
 Without his response, I kept on, explaining my dreams—purposefully leaving out the part I had read about the northern clans—and closed my eyes in an attempt to see them clearer.
 I was recalling the details, her dark hair blowing in the wind, the feeling of being trapped, when my thoughts faded into the blackness of sleep.
 I woke in my own bed, the room lit by the dim light of a single flame suspended above my table.
 A flash of embarrassment hit as it dawned on me Chevelle must have placed me there; he must have seen my home, my room.
 And then I smiled, because he had left me a flame.

During the first three decades of post-colonial independence, almost all of the continent’s 54 states had come under either single-party or military rule.
 The preference for authoritarian rule was often justified by the need for rapid economic development, which could be impeded by opposition to government policies and by the need to contain regional and tribal conflicts.
 Neither of these claims has proven true.
 Living standards have actually declined in most African countries during the last two decades.
 Regional and tribal politics have flourished.
 Dozens of civil and inter-state wars have been fought, accounting for millions of lost lives.
 Food production and employment have lagged far behind population growth.
 In the absence of legal channels of protest, opposition parties have frequently resorted to violence.
 By the end of the 1980s the lack of material progress and the emergence of young educated professionals in leadership positions had fostered, on the one hand, a revolt against single-party rule and, on the other, popular pressure for multi-party democracy that have together resulted in a democratic domino effect, similar to the spread of communist rule which Western democracies had feared would overwhelm South Asia twenty years ago.
 As recently as 1989, only four African countries could be considered stable democracies and three more were moving in that direction.

I outweighed Eric by 20 pounds, but he was stronger and faster.
 No matter in what position we started, at his pleasure and with maddening ease, he flipped me over and pinned me.
 Wondering why, after I had spilled my guts, he appeared to revel in my further humiliation, I flew into a rage, sprang to my knees, and socked him in the stomach.
 I pounced on top of him and socked him again, before he caught hold and flipped me, lashed my arm behind my back and shoved my face into the floor.
 “Listen,” he said, without a hint of condemnation, “you’re not really mad at me.
 You’re mad at yourself, because you think you’re nobody, but you’ve got it all wrong.
 It doesn’t matter if I wrestle better.
 Wrestling’s my sport.
 What if you and I were playing golf or baseball and you clobbered one out of sight, but I hit this little dribbler, then started whining?
 “If Karen doesn’t like you enough, that doesn’t matter either.

She was looking right into me, like I was a sideshow mirror, and maybe I was, man.
 Distorting images, throwing off suncats.
 She saw it all, clear as crystal.
 We went to her place that afternoon.
 She had this Midtown apartment—I don’t know if I can do it justice.
 It was the most filled room I’d ever seen.
 Clutter, but, taken as a whole, it all made sense.
 She called it Plat-Eye Manor, after her dog, Plat-Eye.
 Her three-headed dog.
 (laughs)  That was some dog, used to sit next to me and fix me with its glassy eye, just sit there for hours, man, and I’d end up thinking we were talking.

 but there was nothing else to say.
 Swallowing, she squeezed his hand and turned away.
 As she walked into the garden, she was tempted to turn and look back.
 But that would just heighten their pain.
 With tears running down her cheeks, she quickened her steps.
 Rick watched her disappear into the fog.
 Closing his eyes, he forced himself to think about 1927.
 He pictured Marie calling out for her mother, running into her arms, crying with joy at the reunion.

Maybe I could lessen its impact, somehow have a mini-attack that made my mind blank out, but left me enough control over my body to remain seated in the chair.
 Rachel grabbed my arm, disrupting my concentration.
 "Are you okay?
 What's going on?"
 She had a cell phone out, partially hidden by her desk.
 Part of me wondered why I'd never seen her with a phone before.
 Most girls walked around looking like they'd had some experimental surgery that created a two-way graft between their phone, their hand, and their ear.
 It didn't really matter though.
 Cell phone or not, the biggest part of me was already floating away to somewhere safe.
 "I'll call Alec; he'll know what to do."

If you are going into the most dangerous part of the competition to be injured or killed and you have only one or two points, why bother?” Doi’van said.
 “To be honest, I am surprised how many are left.
 There are still quite a few young fools out there.” “So how many are left now?” Rodregas asked.
 “Fifty-four, on my last count,” Doi’van said.
 Rodregas was a little worried about his shield and wondered if he should jump in and rescue it from the powerful grip of the Hellborn, but he held his tongue and let Doi’van handle the equipment.
 “I see you are employing the forces of the Infernal Realm to aid you in the joust,” said a voice behind Rodregas.
 Rodregas unfortunately recognized the voice as that of Ambassador Van’dret even before he turned and saw him standing there.
 Two nervous looking squires were standing behind him, one holding a glass and a bottle of wine.
 The tall graceful Immortalist had dark robes of deepest black with swirling gold patterns sewn on it.
 His hair was pulled back and to the side in an unusual looking style.

“You sacrifice planning and thought for sheer speed and reflexes,” he said, his breathing steady and practiced.
 He assumed the elf spoke the human tongue, and the sudden killing lunge proved him correct.
 Antonil pulled his head back, the point stopping just shy of drawing blood.
 An upward cut took the blade from the elf’s hand.
 Antonil’s sword looped around, thrust forward, and buried deep inside flesh.
 The elf fell, gasping for air from the fatal wound.
 Blood pooled below him.
 Antonil pulled his sword free and saluted him with the blade.
 “Well fought,” he said.
 An arrow clanged against his sword and ricocheted off.

I looked up the hill to see a bunch of faery jerks running down the hill towards us.
 Emily stood in front of Jason and raised her hands.
 I notched an arrow and aimed.
 Dust kicked up everywhere as I aimed blindly.
 I heard one of them shout out in pain.
 I shot another and another, anger burning through me.
 Stop him.
 I turned around and saw Seth’s body through the dust.
 He looked up at me and mouthed, Jazell.
 “Seth!” I yelled.

 I’m telling you that I’m in love, and that’s a good thing.
 Jim – How did it happen?
 I mean, this afternoon you weren’t in love and now you are.
 Is it anyone I know?
 Art – Well, I met a pretty girl, we talked, and she didn’t run off screaming into the night.
 I found myself attracted to her, and enjoyed her company from the beginning.
 And since she didn’t run off screaming, and she did accept my invitation out for coffee, I got to know her better.
 I wonder if she’ll marry me.

Like a prison.
 ~ I killed three guards to get to her.
 We only had a moment before I was torn away from her, yet I feel I got the message through.
 ~ She came to see me last night.
 I don’t know how she got past the guards.
 But I begged her to keep our secret, for her protection…
 And then several pages were torn from the diary before it continued.
 It was an accident.
 A product of her temper, her human emotions.
 They were testing her, a servant told me.

I could feel my mind trying to shut down, hoping to cushion me from the worst implications of what was coming.
 I knew it was going to be bad, could feel it in a sickening, only-seconds-away-from-vomiting kind of way, but couldn't follow the chain of logic through to the very end.
 I let Jasmin help me pull my books together, and then numbly followed her out to the hallway.
 Alec and the rest of the pack were waiting for us at my locker.
 Jasmin calmly opened my locker and put my things away while I was still trying to come to terms with everything.
 Alec took my hand.
 "Are you okay?"
 I shook my head.
 "This is going to be really bad, isn't it?"
 His silence validated my belief, probably even more than he realized.

Either that or he just keeps God amused with his foolishness.
 Art – Jim, that’s not true.
 He gives up all the time.
 When was the last time he actually saw one of his schemes through to the end?
 Jim – His little plans are nothing.
 If one fails he tries something else.
 The schemes are just a part of his bigger goal of making a huge nuisance of himself and not getting killed while doing it.
 Art – Wonder how much longer he will be able keep on chasing that goal.
 Jim – Well, if he keeps his God’s favor, Gene will be annoying people until he’s one hundred and ten.
 (Eugene enters and Jim sees him, Jim wave’s Gene over) Ah, speak of the devil.

The horror stories of magicians having terrible accidents with spells gone crazy on ley lines were legend.
 This is why Immortalists used circles to manage the power.
 Raven Keep was on such a line but you could not feel it due to the powerful circles built into the tower.
 It was probably why Raven Town was not closer.
 “Come on,” Rodregas said.
 “Let’s get to shelter before dark.” As he headed into the hidden hollow the orchard became clear.
 He was sure that at one point it had straight rows and a pattern to it.
 But the orchard had been wild for a very long time.
 While there was a bunch of fruit trees and berry bushes, most were the descendants of the original orchard and it was hard to find anything that reassembled a straight row.
 The apples trees were in fruit and they all started grabbing a few of each to eat as they went.

A split second later piano music flooded the room through the myriad of speakers mounted on the ceiling.
 The piece Alec's mother was playing was incredibly beautiful, full of lilting chords of joy that seemed to stumble over each other in a cheerful effort to outdo their predecessors in greeting the audience.
 Five minutes later, she started the number over again, playing with variations on the minor notes, and Alec silenced the speakers with another click of his remote.
 "It's beautiful.
 I never realized she was so good, Alec.
 I mean, it's the most incredible thing I've ever heard."
 His smile was a combination of pride and regret.
 "Mother says it represents my birth.
 She was always an excellent performer.
 Donovan says she would've been nationally acclaimed if she'd chosen to pursue a career instead of marrying my father.

LE:  	Bud’s always been a sexual creature, and that’s a turn-on to women.
 He’s always loved women.
 Let me tell you something, women love men who love women.
 And, let’s be honest here.
 I never want less than 100% honesty, from Buddy, from his music.
 From this, whatever this turns out to be.
 Ok?
 BG:  	Lor knows me better than I know myself.
 It’s so good she’s here.

“Because we are.” “Do you think we should tell them about my vision?” I asked.
 He chewed his lip in frustration.
 “Maybe we should, but not include the parts about me.” “Seth,” I said slowly hoping he didn't get mad at me, “we should tell them what's going on with you eventually.
 What if Kojas comes for you and they have no clue why-” “No!” he said sharply, and the tone of his voice surprised me.
 “I can't Jazell, I wouldn't have told you if you hadn't ran after me demanding to know what I was hiding.” “But you're happy I did, right?” I asked.
 He looked away.
 “Yes I am.
 It's a lot better than hiding this on my own.
 The secret just keeps getting bigger.” I rolled my eyes.
 “Emily will find out eventually, and when she does, she'll kill you for keeping a secret from her.” “Let's hope it isn't until you and I figure this thing out.” I nodded and walked back into the cave.

The Knight Captain slowly looked up at the tall figure before him and after a quick examination went to the oddly mismatched pair that stood at each shoulder.
 “You are a squire who wishes to register for the tournament?” asked the Knight Captain.
 While the Knight had probably asked this to a lot of people that day, his tone suggested real curiosity.
 Rodregas grunted acknowledgment and dropped his hand with the Patch of his Knightly Chapter in it.
 The Knight Captain picked it up and studied the detailed patterns woven into the fabric.
 “Chapter and heredity?” the Knight asked.
 “Saurrien was my mentor, Quirren was his mentor, and Bitress was his, Chapter of the Silver Mace,” Rodregas answered.
 The Knight nodded, the answer matched the pattern on the patch.
 “What is your name?” he asked.
 “Rodregas,” he grunted.

The faery’s yells turned to screams and then nothing.
 He fell to the ground and Jason brushed himself off.
 “You okay, Jazell?” he asked me and held out a hand.
 I took his hand and he pulled me up.
 “Yup, I’m just peachy.” “At least you can use sarcasm in a time like this,” he said and started to fight his way through the crowd.
 I followed him quickly.
 I had no desire to become separated again.
 “When can’t you use sarcasm?” I asked loudly.
 He didn’t reply to me because he had spotted Emily.
 She was slowly backing up with her palms out.

They babbled and told those outrageous stories.
 They were sick.
 When my wife and I heard sirens or the phone rang late at night, we always thought the worst.
 Certain police or crime television shows would give us lumps in our throats as we would silently look at each other and know we were thinking the same thing… that might be our son.
 One afternoon while I was at work, Lisa was trying to help Brandon out by organizing some of his bills.
 Brandon told her that he needed to run a quick errand.
 She called me later that day and said she had lost track of him and he wasn’t returning her calls or answering his phone.
 All the usual horrible thoughts began to surface in our minds.
 The day turned into night and we still hadn’t heard from him.
 Close to midnight, as Lisa and I watched a movie together in the dark, there was a loud banging at our back sliding glass door.

Rachel's a good girl, but she was so young when he died.
 She can't really miss him.
 Not like I miss him."
 For a second I thought he was going to argue with her.
 His tired smile had the feel of resignation, of something that'd been well argued over the years.
 "Will you play something for us, Mother?
 Adriana hasn't had the pleasure of listening to your songs."
 I'd rarely seen anyone change moods so quickly.
 "No.
 You know it isn't ready.

Jim – Just enough.
 Johnny – Enough of what?
 Jim – No more of that cliché “everybody hates me” crap.
 God damn it gets old.
 You sound like a character from a stupid teenager television drama.
 You’ve been sounding like that for years now and I’m just getting sick of hearing about it.
 Mom is gone and she probably won’t be coming back so go out and enjoy life for a change.
 Now get busy living or get busy dieing, but what ever you do stop living in the past.
 Johnny – Cliché?
 I’m not the one who just used a movie quote in a inspirational speech.

"Alec, everyone keeps talking as though this fight is soon, but I've never heard an actual date."
 He finally wrapped his arms back around me, but it was a subconscious move, as if he was trying to protect me from what he was going to have to say next.
 "It's after the dance.
 The night of the new moon, an hour or two after the Ashure Day celebration ends."
 I was suddenly even more grateful we were going to the dance together.
 If I only had a couple of weeks to live, then I wanted to spend every possible second with him.
 Chapter 27 I groaned as Alec circled two of my biology essays and handed them back to me.
 "You're doing much better, but you're missing a couple of key components here and here."
 "Has anyone ever told you you're a brutal taskmaster?"
 His smile took away some of the sting over just how careful he was being not to touch me lately.

BG:  	Right.
 That’s actually a really old song—that almost made it onto Turntable.
 I wrote that in Memphis, in Lorelei’s bedroom, right after we had made love.
 There was candlelight dancing on the walls, and outside one of those Memphis thunderstorms that seem like the end of the world, beautiful like the end of the world should be, and Lorelei was lying there naked, a vision out of Titian, and I just started singing those lyrics.
 Those were given to me, you know?
 Like they always existed but I was the one that plucked them from the ether.
 It’s weird, that’s the most Memphis song on the LP, though it really is about, what’s inside us, you know?
 What keeps us going, keeps us growing.
 And, it’s not true unless it makes you laugh.
 That’s what I want to say to my critics, you know, lighten up, irony isn’t dead yet.

Not with everything else he couldn't do for me.
 "Please, I must look horrid.
 If you'd known I could look this bad, you'd never have bothered saving me from Simon and Nathanial."
 Alec cocked his head to the side, as if trying to decide how to respond to my half-serious jest.
 "Actually I was completely serious.
 You are beautiful."
 I waited for the inevitable joke, or backhanded compliment to follow, but he seemed happy to just stop there.
 For once in my life I managed to be smart and do the same.
 "So what's the agenda for today?"
 Alec stretched and then shrugged.

Jim – Not to long now, he couldn’t hold out long under the pressure.
 Even pretending to be strait-laced was hard on Gene, he actually had to cut his hair and look ‘respectable’
 Art – Was I really that out of it during the divorce?
 Gene cut his hair and actually wore nice clothing.
 I think I would have noticed that Jimbo, are you trying to pull one on me?
 Jim  - This all actually happened, and you were out of it, you forgot to pay the bills for three months, and if you recall you wouldn’t take the time to eat unless either Gene, Liz or I brought you something and nagged till you finished it.
 Art – Ah yes, food the fuel for life.
 It doesn’t seem all that important to eat when your world is falling apart.
 How long did it take for Gene to finally snap?
 Jim  - He started spending a lot of time hanging out at their church doing bible lessons.

That explains them.
 You were superimposing what you see over top of what someone like me would see.
 Only how would you know what things look like to us?"
 Alec's chuckle held more than a little resignation in its timbre.
 "You are amazing.
 Anyone else waking up in a strange place would've run away as soon as they regained consciousness.
 At the very least, you should have started screaming.
 Instead you wander around, take in some rather feeble attempts at art, and then sneak out without saying a word."
 Secure in the knowledge he could see me, I stuck my tongue out at him.
 "Hey, my survival instincts, or lack thereof aren't the point.

Not that she’d given me much opportunity.
 I contemplated whether this was her usual behavior toward strangers or if she felt we had a special motherless bond.
 She ran her finger through the substance in the canister and it came out coated in a deep, dark green that had the consistency of grease, which she smeared across the base of my eyelid.
 She continued rambling as she coated various parts of my body with lotions and powders, smoothed my hair with a sweet-scented cream, painted my lips with a soft balm that smelled of spice.
 After she ran out of areas to work with, she opened a tall glass container with black liquid inside and dipped a cut braid of hair into the bottle.
 She drew it out, using the tip to brush an intricate design on the inside of my wrist.
 When she was finished, she leaned over and blew gently on the paint.
 Or ink?
 I was anxious to see the finished work.
 I waited impatiently for her to raise her head again and hoped whatever it was wasn’t permanent.

“Where are they going?” “Uh, we follow them,” I said.
 “I think.” “Yup, we just follow a bunch of monsters that would like to smash us to pulp and serve us for dinner,” Seth said and started to slide down the side of the hill.
 “Brilliant idea.” I followed him down, feeling the grass and dirt scrape the bottom of my leg.
 My pants started to scrunch up causing this slide to be very annoying.
 I decided to ignore it because I had my bow in my hands and had more important things to worry about.
 We crouched behind a rock and watched the group walk off.
 Seth started to stand up and signaled me to wait for him.
 He jumped over and ran out into the open.
 He leaned forward and narrowed his eyes, probably trying to see the disappearing bunch.
 He held his hand out, signaling me to wait.

But preachers often argue that striving does us no good whatever, that in order to grow toward love we need to surrender our selves to God and ask him to lead us.
 Some preachers would contend we can count on God's direct leading, through prayer and messages we will receive if we listen.
 Others would tell us to rely on God indirectly, by reading and following the example of Christ and the principles he gave.
 In the Sermon on the Mount alone, Christ urges us to keep our desires in check, speak the truth, give sacrificially, set aside worries, pray, withhold judgment except about our own thoughts and actions, and ask for good gifts such as wisdom.
 Mostly to slow my whirling mind, I speak a prayer, a request I have often made, asking God to help me love better.
 And what comes is a reminder of something I've been told more than once.
 As I recall, the first time came at the University of San Diego.
 When I moved back to my hometown of San Diego from Chico, I left behind a tenured professorship.
 My two kids lived with me and cost plenty.
 So I started teaching all around.

I'm not very hungry.
 Just a hamburger would be fine."
 "A hamburger?"
 Marie forced her mind back to the present.
 Or the past, depending on one's point of view.
 She and her mother couldn't just pop into the nearest fast food restaurant.
 There was no nearby fast food restaurant.
 "I mean, tea and cucumber sandwiches would be fine."
 At the tearoom her entrance was greeted with cries of disbelief and happiness.
 Everyone was amazed that she looked perfectly healthy and whole, and they were polite and desperately curious when she said she didn't want to talk about what had happened.

“Yes, I want to practice growing.” She glanced at the pendant against my chest.
 She was silent for a moment as she looked into my eyes, almost searching.
 She was probably worried I was sad or missing my mother.
 “Not today.
 It seems I have business with the Council this morning.” Her mouth turned down in a grimace.
 “Oh.” All right, it wasn’t like I didn’t have plenty to do.
 I’d just head to the library and try to find the missing pages to the northern clan documents.
 “Well, I’ll see you then.” I smiled at her and headed around back again to cut through the village.
 I took my time to allow her to make her way to the Council building.
 As my feet scuffed along the path, I heard angry whispers and glanced up to find their source.

It had been a thing of honor, but he spoke of it as if it were a joke.
 “Do you really believe such nonsense?” “What nonsense?
 It isn’t real?” He let out a harsh laugh and I jerked back.
 “Oh, I suppose it’s real.
 The service is real.
 Honestly, Freya, don’t you see?” “See what?” I cursed my bound brain.
 “Grand Council.” I drew a sharp breath at the words.
 “The calling is simply service to Grand Council.
 A hundred years of servitude under the guise of duty and honor.
 What is honorable about doing their bidding?” “So you don’t… answer the call?” I stumbled, searching for words.

Like the day before, what Rick had enjoyed most was seeing Marie's pleasure.
 She'd wanted to see everything, experience everything they'd let her try.
 Everyone had treated her like an eager tourist, little realizing that she was seeing it all from the perspective of someone who'd seen debuts of Hollywood's earliest offerings.
 "Would you like to go dancing?"
 Rick asked as he paid the bill.
 "I don't think so.
 I'm rather tired, and I think I'd just like to relax and think about all that happened today."
 "And dream about your debut?"
 He smiled.
 "We'll go see the movie as soon as it comes out.

Britney was still upset.
 I, on the other hand, was extremely happy I'd made a good enough impression to get a job.
 I didn't like sitting there while Britney badmouthed Mrs. Campbell.
 I looked up during one of Britney's infrequent pauses for air, and caught Alec staring at me.
 Staring wasn't quite the right word though.
 Strangely enough, it didn't seem like he was necessarily mad, but he didn't seem happy either.
 I only caught his eyes for a few seconds before he looked away, but even his normally riveting blue eyes couldn't distract me from my inability to identify the look.
 I was used to people disliking me, ignoring me, or even occasionally liking me, but this was the first time I'd met someone who seemed to be still trying to decide what camp to join long past the time when most kids our age would have either made a decision or just decided I was weird and started ignoring me.
 Britney seemed to be getting suspicious that I wasn't really listening, so I had to make a lot of eye contact over the next few minutes.
 When I finally got a chance to look back up, Alec and his friends weren't at their table.

"Cute dress."
 Marie glanced down at her dress before responding with a puzzled, "Thank you."
 She knew it definitely wasn't in fashion now.
 A little while later Marie took the jeans and several blouses into the dressing room, removing her dress and putting on her favorite of the blouses, a navy blue one with red stripes.
 It was so soft!
 After admiring it in the mirror for a moment, she reached for the smaller pair of trousers.
 The material felt comfortable, but they were so tight!
 Were they supposed to be this tight?
 Rick would know.
 She felt queer walking out in these clothes, but after having seen how women of this decade dressed, she knew she'd draw more attention in her Egyptian-motif dress than in this outfit.

“Follow me,” Qurrah whispered.
 “You will see.”
 He took a step forward and vanished into the shadows.
 Harruq glanced around, swallowed, took two quick breaths, and then hopped into the door with his eyes squeezed shut.
 He expected to thud against wood, feel a strange sense of vertigo, or some other bizarre sensation usually accompanied with magic.
 Instead, he felt only the slightest tingle of cold air before his feet thumped against the floor.
 He opened his eyes to see a posh living room decorated with red and gold furniture, silk sheets, and a lit fireplace.
 Everything oozed elegance, to a point that even the half-orcs knew was over the top.
 When Harruq looked behind him, the darkness had left the door.
 “Why did you not do that to the gate?” he asked.

It seemed like nobody was willing to drive anything around the way it came off of the showroom floor.
 Everything had bigger wheels, and suspension that lifted it up several inches.
 Vincent's truck had more in common with the beasts in monster truck rallies than it did with the souped-up vehicles I'd seen driving around town.
 The tires were the biggest I'd seen on anything outside of a tractor, and the lift kit on it was so outrageously tall that I was pretty sure someone was going to have to lift me into the cab.
 By myself it was going to take a rope and climbing shoes.
 Of course it was black.
 I couldn't imagine Vincent in anything other than a black vehicle.
 Predictably, Vincent was rubbing down his vehicle, but the exercise seemed more targeted to giving him a chance to walk around with his shirt off than it did with cleaning up the already immaculate truck.
 Based on the way the cheerleader types by the garage were watching him, it was working.
 I much preferred Brandon's jeans and tee shirt, tight as it was, over the shorts and shirtless look, but apparently I was in the minority.

"Whoa."
 He caught her hand, chuckling.
 "It's three days before we leave.
 I think you can sit down and eat first."
 But she was too excited to eat.
 "Will we get to meet any stars?"
 "I don't know.
 They guard their privacy.
 But we'll do the Paramount and Universal tours."
 "The what?"

Reluctantly she pulled away.
 "I guess we should finish washing your car."
 "OK."  His eyes focused on her lips.
 His tiny bit of contact with them had been electric.
 He suspected that if he persisted, he could break down her resistance, but he cared about her too much to do that.
 Marie couldn't stop thinking about Rick's kiss.
 It had been brief, but she could remember everything about it in vivid detail.
 She closed her eyes as she stood in the shower, reliving the moment.
 In her mind she could see his face as he told her she was beautiful.
 Her heart had sped up then but nothing like when he'd tilted her chin up and looked into her eyes.

The officers move into place for the bust.
 Several marked police cars hide in an adjacent apartment complex that has a driveway into the grocery store parking lot at the opposite end of the shopping center.
 I am instructed to park my truck’s front end against a fence that borders the parking lot facing the greenbelt.
 I am shown new surveillance photos of the two suspects and their vehicle: a red Dodge Charger with tinted windows.
 The code word which I am to use in a sentence to confirm the exchange of money for drugs has been changed to “Reno” and I see a pattern so I assume that if the deal does not go down this time, my next code word may be “Vegas.” I pray there isn’t a next time.
 Chapter 20: Going Down Finally a red Dodge Charger is driving slowly over the entrance bridge.
 I say, “Red Dodge Charger approaching at one o’clock,” attempting not to move my lips, as the vehicle is coming almost directly towards me on my right.
 The Dodge slows almost to a stop just a couple of car lengths away.
 I am unable to see in the tinted windows of the car but I am certain they can see me; I stare back as if to say, “Is that you?” They are obviously aware that I am there, alone and awaiting their arrival.
 The car slowly pulls away after taking a good look at me.

He could not burn them but knocked them into the middle of the room and then added a couple of the other non-magic powder containers.
 In his final action before he left, he used the crow bar to shatter all the bottles, and made sure to mix the powders together.
 He hopes that would make them impossible to use.
 After moving what he wanted to take with him to his pile at the entrance, he headed down the stairs to the dungeon.
 Rodregas did not want to go down there.
 Some of his worst memories were from his time down in the dungeon.
 Too many terrible deeds had occurred there, not that he had done many of them himself, but he had not been able to stop them.
 He could have tried to stop the terrible things that had happened, but he had simply chosen to survive instead.
 He knew the depth of his lack of true courage from his years of failure to act before now.
 He went through the guardroom and was happy to see that Captain Poir had followed orders; there was no sign of the eight or so prisoners, including his rescued AElfin maiden.

Chevelle stayed.
 Ruby turned to him and breathed a deep sigh but he didn’t respond.
 My head throbbed and I groaned as I pressed the bridge of my nose.
 He was beside me in a flash, unspeaking.
 Ruby handed me another drink.
 It helped, but I was still irritated about the binding.
 “Does this mean we’ll have to train again?” Ruby snickered.
 Chevelle answered slowly, “There has to be a way.
 You broke them before.” I tried to remember how.
 The first magic I could recall was the thistle in the back room at Junnie’s.

I saw a flash of fire off to the side.
 Emily was fine.
 I twisted around so that the troll charged past me.
 I turned and plunged my knife into its back before it could respond and it fell to the ground.
 I felt pain flare in my right foot and looked down to see a frost beast with its teeth in my leg.
 When I tried to pull away, in bit down harder.
 “Ow,” I yelped.
 “Ow,ow,ow, get the heck off me!” I slashed downward and the frost beast let go of my leg.
 It zipped between my legs and launched itself at my left leg.
 I stepped to the side and slammed my foot on the beast’s back.

"Can I try negotiating for something?"
 "Sure.
 What would you like to buy?"
 They wandered around, and what caught her eye was not all the silver, gold, turquoise, and leather that the natives thought an American tourist would want but the colorful things like serapes and bajas--Mexican blankets and pullover jackets.
 She found a pink and turquoise baja that she fell in love with.
 The price was ten dollars, and Marie talked the owner down to six dollars.
 "I did it!"
 she exclaimed, taking her baja from the bag.
 "You did a good job."
 "This is fun.

Rodregas’ blood froze at the sight, though he did his best to remain casual.
 He knew that the Guild had a representative at the Cathedral but had not expected him to be so closely watching the registration table.
 Rodregas fell into old habits of survival.
 He kept his eyes to himself and let himself feel the tiredness of travel on the road.
 When it became his turn, Rodregas stood there silently.
 The knight, an older man with a short gray beard, who was missing his left hand, waved him forward.
 The Knight Captain slowly looked up at the tall figure before him and after a quick examination went to the oddly mismatched pair that stood at each shoulder.
 “You are a squire who wishes to register for the tournament?” asked the Knight Captain.
 While the Knight had probably asked this to a lot of people that day, his tone suggested real curiosity.
 Rodregas grunted acknowledgment and dropped his hand with the Patch of his Knightly Chapter in it.

Jim – Um, ok.
 Liz – I gotta be going soon to the showing.
 Will you please stop by?
 Jim – Will your mother be there?
 Liz – For at least a little while.
 Jim – I really don’t want to see her again.
 Especially after you ‘talk’ to her.
 Liz – She’ll be there for the first half.
 I think she plans to leave about two-ish.
 She’s meeting the gardener to ‘discuss some shrubberies’.

Dieredon kissed her forehead.
 “Put it behind you so you may focus on the task at hand.
 If the half-orcs are guilty, they will make a mistake soon enough.
 Your eyes and ears are vital in confirming their guilt.”
 “I’ll try to keep him talking,” Aurelia said.
 “And I’ll find out more about his brother.
 I hope I can bear Harruq’s company in the meanwhile.
 He can be quite a brute sometimes.”
 “Come now,” Dieredon said, his face suddenly brightening into a smile.
 “He sounds like a real fine man to me.

Qurrah’s smile faded at the ferocity in his brother’s words.
 He glanced down, his mind spinning and reeling.
 “Tell me if you love her,” Qurrah suddenly ordered.
 Harruq glanced at him, his eyes burning fire.
 “Why now, why do you have to ask?”
 “Answer me, brother.
 Now.”
 “No.
 I don’t love her.
 Is that what you want to hear?”

The two dug through dressers upstairs, grabbing old and expensive robes and shirts.
 They then dragged the body outside to where the deceased elf had kept a private garden.
 Thick brick walls guarded against any prying eyes.
 They dug a large hole in a corner and then bled the body dry, letting the fluids soak into the dirt.
 Occasionally, they would halt and listen, worried their violent struggle had reached unwanted ears.
 No curious investigators arrived, however, and they continued with their dark deed.
 When the blood dripping from the elf’s wounds became but a trickle, they filled the hole and moved on.
 Using the clothes and robes from upstairs, the two brothers wiped away as much of Ahrqur’s blood as they could.
 They tossed the bloody clothes, the table, and the pieces of glass they into the fireplace and burned them.
 Harruq wrapped the body in spare blankets he found in a closet.

The primary goal when getting beaten by a person nearly twice one’s size is to limit injuries and not escalate the violence because there is no winning.
 I had seen this tactic with my grandfather and my uncle, and my brother and I were now in a similar situation.
 When someone saw the marks or bruises on our bodies we lied so we didn’t get a repeat performance.
 Gym teachers or other kids during showers after PE class asked the most questions.
 We just blamed it on each other as a fight between brothers.
 We just learned to live with it and survive.
 We became quite the fighters at school and other kids learned not to screw with us or we would beat them down.
 It was just something one gets good at when one is in constant training.
 My parents—I had been instructed to refer to Dino as my father—entertained a lot.
 The rooms would fill with drinkers and drunks, for it was the seventies and the cocktails were flowing freely.

 Karen – Yes, that’s the one.

More recent rate increases in the US threaten to halt the declining trend in unemployment observed over the past year.
 The extreme disruption of the centrally planned economies of Eastern Europe during the early stages of their transition to market economies has led to high domestic unemployment in most cases.
 Slow recovery from the recent global recession has restrained the growth of foreign trade.
 Down-sizing by major corporations in response to intense competitive pressures has eliminated many jobs which are not being restored, even after the recession is over.
 Privatization and restructuring of public sector companies in response to fiscal pressures has had a similar effect.
 In the United Kingdom alone, an estimated 500,000 jobs will be lost for this reason in 1994.
 The impact of structural adjustments programmes has slowed economic growth and new job creation in a number of developing countries.
 Gains in productivity due to new technology, particularly delayed gains from the micro-computer revolution of the 1980s and the growth of factory automation, have slowed job growth in some industries.
 The increasing competitiveness of the NIEs of Asia and most recently China has displaced jobs in the West, primarily unskilled jobs.
 The major impact of several of these factors has already been felt and is now beginning to subside.

I was pretty sure Britney was capable of understanding, she just didn't care, which was the one thing virtually guaranteed to make me mad.
 Stupidity was bad enough; laziness would be a hundred times worse.
 Still, by the second time through I'd clarified a couple of points I'd been a little fuzzy on, and was almost ready to believe Britney might actually apply herself to listening.
 I was so caught up in what I was doing, and the ever-so-slowly growing light of interest in Britney's eyes, that the rest of the class had fallen silent for a full twenty seconds before the drop in noise registered for me.
 "I want everyone back to their regular desks and hard at work on their assignments."
 Mrs. Campbell wasn't as pale as she'd been when she'd left, but she still looked unsettled and more than a little unhappy, presumably with both whatever had caused her to leave so quickly, and the fact that she'd come back to a class where almost nobody had been doing anything productive.
 I had a couple of heartbeats to hope she'd realized I'd been trying to help Britney with her homework, and therefore not deserving of any punishment.
 "Britney, Adriana, I'll need to speak with you both after the bell."
 Apparently the whole justice thing was on the fritz right now.
 It would probably start working again just in time to punish me for whatever bad thing I did next.

I am indeed impressed by Gene’s willpower, I didn’t know he even possessed that much.
 He didn’t last much longer did he?
 Jim – (shaking his head) No.
 At his baptism.
 Well I thought he was going through with it, he had me convinced.
 I thought he was for real and for true going to join that church.
 Art – That boy could make a fantastic actor one day.
 If he doesn’t wind up in prison.
 Or dead.
 Jim – I think God likes him.

He led her into a large department store and began searching for ladies' lingerie.
 While Marie looked around at all the lacy, sometimes colorful articles, Rick found a saleslady.
 "My friend over there, for reasons I won't go into, may not know her sizes.
 Will you help her find a couple of bras and some underwear?"
 "Of course--I'll take care of her."
 The lady could tell Marie's underwear size with no problem.
 But when Marie came out of the dressing room complaining that the 32B was too tight, she wondered how she'd missed the girl's bust size by such a margin.
 Marie found that she loved shopping for modern lingerie.
 She liked lace and rich colors and chose black, emerald, fuchsia, and royal blue underwear.
 It really didn't matter, she supposed, what her underwear looked like.

I used a hundred different names for a hundred different songs.
 There’s no way I can remember them all.
 BG: 	Tell me some of the artists who recorded your songs?
 CM:  	Oh, hell.
 Um, the Airplane, Solomon Burke, The Remains, Judy Collins, Ginsberg---
 BG:  	Allen Ginsberg.
 The poet.
 CM:  	Sure.
 He did some recording too.
 He did, let’s see, “Blues for Sandra Leathers” on his “Cannabis” LP, a sort of raga rendition of it, much changed from the bluesy take on that one that Canned Heat did.

"I thought it much safer to stay in one place and wait for you rather than wander around and risk getting knocked down."
 I felt my skin flush with embarrassment.
 It was fairly gentle as teasing went, but I hated how my skin looked when I was blushing which meant I blushed more than any two other people.
 Not only that, I couldn't ever come up with anything good to say when someone teased me.
 Brandon seemed to sense my unease, and flashed another gentle smile.
 "I just wanted to find out if you had a way home tonight after you finished up with your math stuff."
 Britney was almost jumping up and down.
 "Oh, don't worry, Brandon, I'll give Adri a ride home.
 The poor thing lives all the way out in the Anderson home.
 I've been giving her a ride into school and home almost every day since she moved."

As I study them, one at a time my vision cuts deeper, and I see the creator alive in each of them.
 And as I picture Jesus, I recognize some of His expressions.

 Forgiveness.
 Loyalty.
 Love.

 Nowhere near as much as He deserves.
 But more now than before.

As she'd promised when she'd invited them, Teri had made a Chinese meal.
 "House rules: you have to spend at least 15 minutes using chopsticks," she told them as they sat down to dinner.
 "After that, you can have a fork if you want."
 Marie had eaten in Chinese restaurants in 1927, so she managed with the chopsticks.
 The meal was enjoyable, but she couldn't keep her thoughts from wandering to Rick.
 His neck looked so warm and inviting.
 She wanted to bury her face in the crook of his neck and shoulder.
 Did he like being kissed on the neck as much as she did?
 Just the memory of his kisses made her heart race.
 They had coffee and dessert in the living room.

I was also certain, by the way she watched me, that Ruby had seen me spying.
 Her mouth was twisted in a smile, loaded with false honey.
 I noticed her eyes then, looking past the heavy paint they wore, to dark green jewels… emeralds.
 They were so like those I had just examined in the mirror that I had to look away.
 “Frey,” I replied softly.
 “Thank you for the room.” She seemed disappointed I had no further comment.
 She flitted her hand in dismissal as she swirled out of the room and back to Chevelle, the metal bracelets around her wrists tinkling like chimes.
 “I’m off to town then.
 You know, a handsome hunk of horsemeat was asking about you this morning.” My ears perked up.
 Someone was asking about Chevelle?

It has finally lifted the suffocating blanket of pessimistic economic determinism that has stifled human hopes and aspirations for nearly 200 years since Thomas Malthus first set forth the thesis that human population will always outrun the growth of food production, thus ensuring the perpetual poverty of humankind.
 The remarkable achievements of countries such as India, which at a time when famine threatened to claim millions of lives launched a massive national programme that increased foodgrain production by three-quarters, and China, which nearly doubled food grain production over the last two decades, are outstanding testaments to the accomplishments of people in many countries.
 Worldwide, production increases in major cereal crops are estimated to have provided enough food for more than a billion people.
 Food has become a symbol of our collective human endeavour to create a better world for all.
 But the victory has been partial and neither the challenge nor the opportunity which food presents have been fully addressed.
 It is of crucial importance not only to the poor, but also to the peace and stability of global society that we complete the task of banishing famine and hunger once and for all.
 Hunger anywhere threatens peace everywhere.
 Hunger leads to political instability, social unrest, massive migrations, rebellions, civil war, crime and violence.
 Prosperity, which eliminates hunger, also tends to eliminate violence.
 Even in war-ravaged Africa, experience shows that where food is plentiful, war is avoided.

 Last time we did you spiked the little wooden-dealy that holds the letters when you won.

Much easier.
 When the two tried to close in, Qurrah lashed out with his whip.
 One ducked away in fear.
 The other managed to deflect the lash and then charge, his sword leading.
 The flaming leather curled back around like a living thing.
 Qurrah sent it at the nearest opponent.
 He blocked, and then realized blocking was what the whip wanted him to do.
 A cocoon of fiery leather enveloped his sword, pulling him closer.
 The half-orc’s free hand reached out.
 A soft blue enveloped it as he whispered words of a spell.

Before the prisoners could look around, he shoved them to the right side and strode over to Ravenhurr, who was peering into the night sky through a long tube with tiny glass panes at each end.
 Ravenhurr loved to boast that the tube brought the stars closer to him.
 He was never one to hurry about anything, at least not before tonight.
 At that moment, though, his lean body quivered with excitement.
 “Master," Rodregas said, with a respectful bow, "The prisoners are ready.” Ravenhurr looked up.
 His eyes passed over Rodregas to glance at the prisoners.
 He nodded without a word and went back to peering through the tube.
 Rodregas had never understood how the stars in the night sky could make the world closer or farther away from the Celestial Realm, where the Gods lived, or how that could affect magic, but he knew the placement of the stars was critical to the success of the ceremony tonight.
 Ravenhurr was an attractive man, like most of the Immortalist Sorcerers.
 After all, if you can pick your body, why would you ever choose an ugly one?

Chased him.
 Ruby’s whip cracked in front of me and I knew the advance had gotten too far.
 And I was tied to a wall.
 Why hadn’t they killed me already?
 I waited for the flames.
 What came instead was far more excruciating.
 I expected to collapse as my body disconnected from my mind, but the vines held me in place.
 I saw a few final flickers of the battle before my eyes looked toward the sky, rolling back into my head.
 I had no way of forming a coherent thought or I might have been afraid.

After a second or two I gave up and nodded.
 "Okay, I promise to be good and concentrate on getting better, if you'll come keep me company."
 The flash of emotion, barely visible in Alec's eyes, was a source of hope and despair all at once.
 Eagerness, desire.
 Both curbed by the same iron will that'd continued fighting long past where most people would've given up and died.
 I patted the bed next to me, wincing slightly as even that simple motion pulled on things that weren't meant to be pulled on.
 He stared at me for several seconds, and then sat down on the bed.
 I waited, and then when I was sure that was as close as he planned on getting, I slid closer, resting my head on his arm.
 As long as I was careful not to go too far, not to touch too much of him, I could get away with that much.
 His half-imagined sigh sent little trills of satisfaction through me.

Billy Graham followed, and began to speak with such gentle authority, he stopped my eyes from wandering to the neck of the babe with auburn curls.
 Billy Graham quoted from a Bible prophet, in a manner that made me feel prophesied to.
 He commanded, Learn to do well, relieve the oppressed and the fatherless, plead for the widow.
 Come now, he said, and let us reason together.
 Though our sins are as scarlet, they can be as white as snow.
 If only we’re willing and obedient, we can reap the good of the land.
 And he warned us.
 The hydrogen bomb had cast its shadowy threat of annihilation over the whole earth.
 Sooner than we imagined, the basic power of the universe would be given into the hands of mad men.
 Then, how could our planet avoid destruction?

"We'll get one of the next size too."
 "May I help you?"
 Both Rick and Marie turned to the salesgirl.
 "We'd like to see some casual shirts for her," he said.
 "OK--we have some really pretty ones that just came in."
 She led them to a rack.
 "There are some more in the corner over there."
 She smiled at Marie.
 "Cute dress."
 Marie glanced down at her dress before responding with a puzzled, "Thank you."

Her family decides she's crazy, and I agreed.
 Hoping to keep the light alive, I visited several churches that gave me the creeps, with clammy skin and something like nausea, the same feeling I have gotten from the sallow eyes of anorexics who obviously courted suicide, and from remembering nights I had to spend with my sinister grandmother, the Christian Scientist.
 Another couple churches reminded me of the country club where I used to smash golf balls until I grew weary of the country club people.
 I tried a few college youth groups whose leaders appeared either self-righteous or too naive to offer much truth.
 After all, I surmised, they hadn't witnessed black people living on a quarter an hour, or attended many funerals, or gotten beat up for no reason and realized they could easily do murder.
 I felt as lost as Raskolnikov, in Crime and Punishment.
 Maybe my only hope was to find a Sonia.
 Me vs. Everybody
 About a year ago, in church, the band performed “Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing”.
 Some words from the second verse leapt out at me.

After a few minutes of white-knuckled fear, I was finally able to relax a little, and enjoy the feeling of having Brandon so close while the wind tossed my hair back and forth.
 The other girls were studiously ignoring me while they gossiped back and forth about everyone from underclassmen to teachers and other adults in the town.
 I didn't want to join in the gossip, and Brandon was sprawled out on the pickup bed with his eyes closed.
 I settled for contemplating the glorious sunset's myriad colors.
 We passed some kind of border into one of the parks.
 Vincent slowed down a little more as I was busy taking in the incredible pinks and purples that were dominating the western sky.
 It was like someone had splashed glowing paint across a window and then gone back and painted in picture-perfect clouds to complete the scene.
 I'd seen plenty of amazing sunsets back home, but there was something about the rugged, almost hostile, skyline here that gave this one a spectacular level of depth.
 Maybe Mom was right about the west after all.
 Sure, it was hotter than Satan's kitchen, and a dermatologist's worst nightmare, but the skylines were amazing.

I got the sense the operations being applied to the formulas were being explained very well, I just didn't have the vocabulary to follow what she was saying.
 By the time class finally ended I was fighting not to become emotional.
 The fact that Britney looked for a moment like she was debating whether or not to wait for me before finally stopping next to the door with her arms crossed, didn't help.
 I threw my book and binder into my backpack and tromped up to the front of the classroom.
 Mrs. Campbell looked up when I reached her desk.
 "Here's your form, among other things."
 I verified that the top sheet had her signature on it, and then turned to go.
 She didn't let me get very far.
 "From your bewildered expression during class it appears you aren't transferring in from another school.
 I expect most of your other teachers are just letting you pick up from where they are now.

Rodregas waited a moment and then looked at the knight who stood outside the match.
 The knight did not look as surprised at the quickness of the match as Rodregas.
 He simply nodded toward Rodregas.
 Rodregas left the square and the knight sent the next two in.
 By mid morning Rodregas had cleared out his square without major effort.
 He noticed that all the other squares were still going on.
 His matches had ended faster than the others.
 His body’s balance of strength and speed were at full advantage in hand-to-hand fighting.
 He fought three others at the end of the afternoon; all three had won their group of matches.
 Rodregas thought that they might have been tough opponents if they had not been so beaten up.

Looking towards the waterfall, I found a shimmering ribbon of light working its way down the rock face.
 The sight was so incredibly beautiful it took me several moments to realize the tendril was the waterfall I'd been looking for.
 I reached into the dancing pool of light at my feet and smiled as my cupped hands came away filled with water that lit up my palms.
 I couldn't imagine anything more surreal.
 I might have stayed there for hours if the barest whisper of sound hadn't distracted me.
 Alec was staring at me, an expression of disapproval marring otherwise perfect features.
 "Of all the places for you to intrude, why did it have to be here?"
 For a second, surrounded as I was by such beauty, I did feel like an intruder.
 He was gorgeous, and his tan skin seemed to have the slightest hint of light playing beneath its surface.
 I was as plain and ugly as always.

I remember he would carry a rare $1000 bill and attempt to pay his bill with it to shock the waiters, who would say, “We can’t change that!” My mom was wearing fur coats and new jewelry all the time.
 Dino was “in the import-export” business; we would later find out that he was involved in a criminal enterprise and during this time was smuggling diamonds.
 It was not unusual for Dino’s associates to come to the house with weapons inside their jackets.
 When they played poker, stacks of hundred dollar bills spilled across the table, and one of the requirements to sit at the table was to put your gun in a pile of weapons across the room.
 I guess they didn’t want the loser to play his trump card with a pistol!
 My brother and I hustled drinks for them for small tips.
 After we were told to go to bed, we would hide behind the counter that blocked the table where they played cards.
 We could stay there late into the night and hear details of these shady lives.
 They all had odd nicknames.
 One man was called “The Painter” and I have no idea where the name came from but I did know that if they needed someone’s house “painted” that this man was going there to kill them.

First use by any nation must automatically invoke the strongest collective security measures by the UN Security Council.
 Based on the precedent of the Chemical Weapons Treaty, the proposal for a universal ban on the possession of nuclear weapons by any nation should be placed before the Security Council for a vote.
 The five permanent members should agree to the suspension of their veto power on this issue so crucial to the future of humanity.
 8.The danger to all nations of unexpected and unprovoked attack from near or distant powers can be vastly reduced by declaring an immediate ban on the use of ballistic missiles of all types, including those carrying conventional war heads.
 This would eliminate the discriminatory provisions that deny missile acquisition to some while preserving the right of others to maintain and develop this purely offensive capability.
 It would also eliminate the need for missile defence systems, which no nation can afford and which are the only possible defence against ballistic missile weapons.
 The ban on use should be followed by urgent measures to dismantle and scrap this entire class of weapons worldwide.
 9.Highest priority must be given to controlling and reversing the proliferation of small arms in line with the determined international measures employed to curb hijacking.
 As an immediate first step, these weapons should be classified and a UN register created to monitor their manufacture and sale.
 Agreements should be negotiated between major arms suppliers to severely restrict production and sales.

All the better if he never does.
 All the better if that house burns down while he’s still inside in some sort of drunken stupor.

 That’s all it could ever be.
 You’ve pretty much been my family since mom left.
 It would…I dunno, it would let me move on, help me to move on I guess.

The rest of the night, the two lovers spent quietly connected and at peace, but they shared few words.
 In the morning after meditation, Doi’van pulled forth two wooden staves that he had cut and said with a smile and an exaggerated wink, “Apparently you are healed up from your wound now, so I think it is time to stop with these making of shadows like children and time for some more physical training.” As he finished speaking he tossed Rodregas one of the staves.
 “With my people we teach our children to fight using the staff.
 It is hard to kill someone by accident with a staff, but you can still deliver pain.
 The avoidance of pain is a great way to teach someone to be nimble and quick.
 My war masters at the palace would say you two are too old to learn the staff, but it is the way that I know.” “Sir Paladin,” he said to Rodregas, imposing the unearned honor title.
 “I assume with your training from all your ex-knights that you know how to use the staff?” As Doi’van spoke he looked at how Rodregas was holding the staff.
 “Fight with a staff?” Rodregas responded in surprise.
 “No, can’t say that I ever have.
 The weapons of the Knight are the sword, the mace, the lance and the bow.

I was still so tired, and I'd had the most wonderful dreams.
 They were a little foggy now, but they seemed to have involved Alec coming to my rescue, and then holding my hand as I went to sleep.
 It wasn't until I finally placed the familiar voice that everything started coming back to me.
 I sat up with an abruptness that nearly knocked Alec off of his perch on the edge of my bed.
 Him still being there, looking at me with a barely restrained amusement glimmering in his eyes, calmed my racing pulse.
 "You're still here."
 "You sound disappointed.
 Do you want me to leave?"
 His expression had taken on the guarded blankness I still hadn't learned how to read, so I wasn't sure whether he was joking or not.
 "No, not disappointed, just surprised.

Money, information, education, technology, public opinion, training, administrative decisions, transport, and communication are powerful social forces and resources.
 Their productivity can be increased by increasing the speed with which they are employed, in the same way that land productivity can be raised by increasing cultivation from one to two cropping seasons per year.
 In the most industrially advanced nations, the velocity of money is roughly 2.5 to 3 times higher than in the average developing country.
 Removing administrative red tape and inefficiencies in the banking system can multiply the use value and productivity of real money, because the same money can be utilized for more transactions.
 The same is true for information, technology, training, transport and other factors.
 Increasing the speed of dissemination of information and new technology can accelerate the creation of new businesses and new jobs.
 In many developing countries, inefficient bureaucracies are slow to take decisions, issue licences, review applications, sanction loans, and amend legislation.
 This inefficiency directly impacts on the pace of development.
 Streamlining and expediting decision making and the movement of other social resources is a highly effective strategy for spurring development.
 Comparative scales need to be created to measure the movement of each of these social forces within and between nations.

“I would encourage you to be careful on your trip over.
 You did hear about what happened to Ravenhurr?” asked Taiga.
 Van’dret almost felt his eye brows rise, “of course, but what should I watch out for?
 I heard it was just some sort of accident.
 I was not aware that any of the Knights of the Order were implicated.” Taiga smiled and waved a hand in a dismissing motion.
 “Oh, don’t misjudge my words.
 I did not mean to imply any misdeeds of our valiant Knights of the Soaring Heavens.
 I am not aware of any of them doing much of anything, much less kill an Immortalist.” “Than what should I keep my eye out for?” asked Van’dret.
 He was becoming even more curious to the direction of the conversation.
 “You, my fine Van’dret, are more in the world than most of us.

“Please, no, take it away, I’ll do anything, anything, just keep it away.
 Don’t let it touch me, please, please, DON’T LET IT TOUCH ME!”
 The man screamed for the next two minutes.
 Then he died.
 “What did you do to him?” Harruq asked once the man was dead.
 “Fear is an entertaining weapon, is it not?”
 The warrior shook his head in wonder, but Qurrah said no more.
 “Do we leave the bodies here?” Harruq asked.
 The necromancer trotted over to the dead noble and did not answer.
 Instead, he ruffled through the silk robes until he found a scroll marked with the seal of the king.

 "She isn't my Kim--not any more."
 It had been over a year since they'd broken up.
 "Yeah.
 So I thought maybe she could be my Kim.
 I ran into her at lunch downtown, and I invited her out for drinks that evening.
 She's good, Rick.
 It was the first time I'd been alone with her--you know, without you and my own date--and it took her less than ten minutes to figure out that I'm not exactly the marrying type.
 I still don't know how I gave myself away.

 "Perfect.

It looks like it’s just a bunch of broken pottery.
 Art – That I have not a clue.
 Is there a marker on it somewhere?
 Karen – Yes, there is.
 Art – What does it say?
 Karen – It’s called The Importance of Bubble Wrap.
 The explanation explains that it is the artist’s trip of self discovery with other mediums, including the written word.
 Really makes you think doesn’t it, she must be a genius, to go and do something like that.
 To take the mundane and make it art.
 Art –She just dropped some pottery down the basement stairs when she was trying to put it into storage.

He’ll graduate with a B.A.
 next year with near-perfect grades and two minors, in Latin and Spanish.
 Still, his greatness, the character trait that makes me hope someday we’ll find a President like him, is his devotion to do whatever is good and right, though it might be the hardest way.
 A question.
 How, given the world’s need for such people and his belief that his young wife’s gifts will make her a mother able to lavish her child with love and wisdom, could a man who, when a novice parent, helped create and develop two such excellent beings as Darcy and Cody decline to make and help raise one more.
 After the exams, written and oral, Pam got euphoric and believed she couldn’t fail at anything.
 If she wanted to be a mom, she could do it.
 And, she said on account of my kids, it appeared I had good genes.
 So we decided to get to work.
 Mighty pleasant work, which we’re both apparently competent at.

“Freya?” a soft voice asked.
 I looked up, startled.
 Chevelle stood just in front of me.
 He dropped to his knees and reached out to touch the mark across my cheek.
 Shame flooded me, and I turned my head to hide the evidence, but his hand cradled the side of my face.
 Chapter Four Flame
 “Freya,” he repeated in a softer voice as he lifted my chin.
 He appeared to have real concern as he glanced from what I was sure was now a welt to my eyes, and I struggled to keep the tears that were welling up from falling.
 I’d not had a caring touch from anyone for so long I didn’t know how to react.
 And I was ashamed.

 CM:  	I meant, who opened for you, at the Shell, etc.
 BG: 	Oh, yeah.
 Well, there were a lot of groups around Memphis then.
 None of them went anywhere, but that was ok.
 They were making music, they were happy.
 Kids, most of them.
 Some were good, some were real good, you know?
 Well, the Hombres, of course.
 They had that hit.

To keep me safe from the others?
 “You remembered what they did to your mother?” I felt my face pale.
 I’d known they were dangerous, but did he mean to submit was to accept her fate?
 The image of flames and a circle of cloaks surrounding her was there again and I had to force it away before it turned to an image of me.
 Protection, he’d kept saying as we worked on magic.
 They’re going to burn me.
 “They would kill me because of the pendant, the library?” “No, Frey.
 You have broken some of your bonds.
 They will not risk trying to bind you again.” I struggled with an intake of breath.
 He stood and started toward me, about to speak again—just as the door swung open.

"--and you have a certain right to feel possessive."
 He kissed the top of her head.
 "We'll leave it at that for now, OK?"
 "OK." After a few moments, he raised his head and pulled away slightly.
 When she looked up at him, so beautiful and trusting and fragile, he bent his head to kiss her.
 But she turned her face away.
 "I'm sorry," he whispered, kissing her temple instead of her lips, her full, soft, luscious red lips .
 .
 .
 "Let's find something funny to watch."

Jim – Alright, alright.
 Well you remember when Gene was calling people up at three in the morning and doing that evil laugh…
 Liz – Yeah, that got annoying…
 Jim – I know, he did it to me like 10 times.
 Liz – So?
 Jim – Finally I just snapped and told him that calling people and laughing like a maniac wasn’t evil, it was just annoying.
 Liz – What does that have to do with it?
 Jim – Well, he kept on badgering me and asking me how he could make it truly evil, you know Gene, once he gets something into his head he sticks with it until he gets it working, unless it almost kills him.
 Liz – Or until he gets beaten up.
 Jim – That too.

 Eugene – I didn’t use and hand signs.
 Jim – That was funny, it took em 5 minutes to put all those signs together and realize what you said.
 When they finally did, I thought they we’re gonna die laughing.
 And then you turned that dark red color and ran off.
 And then they laughed even harder.
 Eugene – I didn’t use any hand signs damnit.
 Jim – I know, you used your cache of ‘your mamma’ jokes on em.

 "Mmm.
 I'm glad we're eating right now.
 If we weren't, I'd want to run out to one of those buffets."
 "If you're around long enough, I'll take you to one."
 He froze, afraid his remark would make her start worrying again.
 But her attention was completely on her chowder.
 Relaxing again, he asked casually, "What do you do for fun in 1927?"

His horse neighed a quick question, one Dieredon wished he could laugh at.
 “Everyone can be killed,” he said, tying his hair behind his head.
 “And no, I have no plans of breaking my ribs again.”
 The horse made an interesting little noise, one Dieredon had long ago learned was laughter.
 He smacked her rump, earning himself an angry neigh.
 “Fly on.
 You don’t want to miss the fun, do you?”
 A snort was his answer, but the creature did fly faster toward the rest of its kin.

I hadn't done that to anyone in months, it'd been my trademark expression for when a family member had made me mad.
 "Okay, you're right.
 I didn't think you'd show."
 "I should be very hurt by your lack of faith, but seeing as how you've been through so much lately, I'll forgive you."
 My heart was suddenly trying to hammer its way out of my throat, which had constricted so tightly I couldn't seem to get any air down to my starving lungs.
 "How did you...nobody knows..." Brandon's hand was on my shoulder despite my inability to remember how it had gotten there.
 "Are you okay?
 I was just kidding, you know, about the near fight and then telling Alec off and having Britney decide she was moving on to greener pastures.
 I didn't mean anything by it."
 The attack was still trying to overwhelm me, but Brandon not knowing the full extent of my weakness robbed it of some of the momentum necessary to roll me all the way under.

Johnny – Yeah, he only lives a mile away from here.
 Jim – I just think its part of his master evil plan to piss you off.
 Seems that Gene has once again scored a point for the forces of darkness.
 I wonder if he’s working for the Canadians.
 You guys ever seen Gene drink beer and watch hockey?
 Johnny – I don’t watch Gene do anything.
 I just wish he’d get outta here.
 Jim – Maybe if you’re lucky, and ask nicely, he’ll teach you about Canada.
 Then my beloved brother, you can pretend to fit in, but secretly work for the resistance forces.
 Liz – That just may work.

“Make your way.” I pushed past him feverishly, starting toward town.
 But I quickly recalled the incident at the library and turned, heading toward home.
 Until I remembered my run-in with Fannie.
 I had nowhere to go.
 A pain throbbed deep in my chest.
 Instinct pushing me, I ran for the clearing where I’d learned with Chevelle.
 He was there, waiting for me.
 The pain in my chest dulled a little.
 Or maybe it was only overwhelmed by a new pressure.
 I crossed to him slowly.

"Do you see a lot of girls?"
 "You've been living with me for a week.

 She smiled.
 "One called this week."
 "Did I go out with her?"
 Her smile faded.
 "You should have.
 I don't want to disrupt your life, Rick."
 Briefly he considered trying again to kiss her but instead took a lock of her hair to play with.

Emily and Jason were sitting in the center of the cave, playing some kind of hand game.
 Jason hit Emily in the arm and she started yelling at.
 So, this is typical thing to wake up to.
 I stood up and walked over to Seth.
 He looked up from the ground and saw my troubled face.
 “What's wrong, Jazell?” “I need to speak to you,” I said in a low voice, “alone.” Seth nodded in understanding and I followed him out of the cave.
 We stood off to the side near the edge of the cliff where Emily and Jason couldn't see us.
 For a minute, I didn't say anything because I didn't know what to say.
 I hesitated, but knew that if I told anyone about the dream, it would be Seth.
 So what was the point in waiting?

Mrs. North again?"
 I ignored the spate of nasty looks shot my way, gathered my books, accepted the bundle of papers, and hurried off to the stairs.
 It was later than last time, so unless I was quick the bell was going to ring before I made it back down the stairs.
 The congestion was bad in the halls, but for some reason it was twice as bad around stairs.
 Apparently I was hurrying just a little too fast.
 I tripped just before I hit the first step, and almost went crashing down the flight that led to the basement.
 Luckily I was just quick enough to grab the banister and save myself from a broken neck.
 I didn't quite manage to avoid twisting my ankle though, so I limped all the way up to the second floor.
 Trying to be as casual as possible, I looked into the art room as I hobbled by, but they'd rearranged their stations, and someone's easel was in the way now.
 The sprained ankle had slowed me down enough that there was no way I was going to make it back to my locker before the bell rang.

"I've wanted to say thanks for a while.
 I really appreciate you making Cassie back down yesterday.
 Nobody else has ever stood up for me like that.
 At least not people that I didn't already know."
 Based on what I'd seen less than thirty hours ago, it didn't look like her friends stood up for her either.
 "No worries, it just seemed like the thing to do at the time.
 Why did she want to hurt you anyways?"
 Rachel looked down, but somehow it wasn't a gesture that conveyed guilt.
 "It's complicated."
 I'd spent too much time with emotions and thoughts floating around in my own head that I didn't want examined too closely.

“I assume with your training from all your ex-knights that you know how to use the staff?” As Doi’van spoke he looked at how Rodregas was holding the staff.
 “Fight with a staff?” Rodregas responded in surprise.
 “No, can’t say that I ever have.
 The weapons of the Knight are the sword, the mace, the lance and the bow.
 Those are the weapons of a warrior,” he stated.
 “And what do you do when facing a warrior in full plate armor?” asked Doi’van.
 “Even chain mail can stop an arrow or the edge of a sword.
 And while a mace is great against chain, crushing your opponent and breaking their bones, such tactics take far too long against plate armor.” Rodregas was not sure what to say to that question.
 The mace or the war hammer was, of course, the weapon of choice against all well armored opponents.
 Doi’van was right, edged weapons were not of much use against a full set of plate armor.

 November.
 The basement.
 Liz’s Jesus/Elvis posters are hanging in the background.
 Jim is back from school for Thanksgiving.
 Johnny and Gene are sitting in the couch playing video games.
 Jim is also on the couch waiting his turn.
 Liz is painting their picture as they do it.
 There is a table set up in the background in preparation for dinner.
 Jim – I get to play Johnny when you two are done with this match.

“Sleep well?” she asked.
 “Oh,” I started, my voice hoarse.
 She handed me a glass of water, which she smoothly traded for the book.
 “Dreams,” I complained.
 She smiled as she sat on the bed beside me.
 “Some seek out the breath.
 They say it is foresight.” “Foresight?” She nodded.
 “What did you see?” She raised an eyebrow questioningly.
 “Not the future.” She laughed.

In many countries, the problem of hunger has less to do with insufficient food production than with distribution or entitlement.
 The poor lack remunerative employment opportunities to generate the purchasing power needed to obtain the minimum essential requirements of food.
 In 1990, the Commission undertook a study of alternative strategies to eradicate poverty among the 300 million extremely poor in India, representing about 25 per cent of the poor worldwide, by more extensive development of commercial agriculture and agro-based industries.
 Following ICPF's third plenary meeting in Madras in October 1991, ICPF's Prosperity 2000 plan for creating 100 million jobs in India was presented to the Indian government, which incorporated the strategy in its Eighth Five Year Plan.
 The findings of that study and the strategic recommendations that emerged from it convinced us that eradicating the spectres of hunger, unemployment and poverty was possible even though these problems are present on such a massive scale in many developing countries.
 Events continued to accelerate with the break-up of the USSR later that year, followed by the collapse of the Eastern European economies in 1992.
 Simultaneously, the slowdown in trade within this region and the high cost of Germany's reunification were having an unexpected and unwelcome impact on economic recovery in the industrial countries.
 Reduced military spending, large budget deficits and declining imports from Eastern Europe slowed growth and aggravated the already acute problem of unemployment in Europe and North America.
 Rising anxiety over prospects for employment in the 1990s posed a serious threat to global trade negotiations and to the prospects for growth in the developing world.
 Examination of the rising problem of unemployment in industrial nations led us to the formulation of a comprehensive strategy for full employment in the West.

The half-orc shrugged, drew his swords, and began walking.
 A sleek staircase led to the upper floor, while through the hallway they could see a room with an iron stove and shelves for storing food.
 “Which way do we go?” Harruq asked.
 “Up,” Qurrah said.
 “And quiet, before you wake him.”
 “Too late,” said a voice from the stairs.
 Both turned to see Ahrqur standing at the top step, his arms crossed.
 He was dressed in a long green robe.
 Silver swirls marked the sleeves and front.
 Brown hair fell far past his shoulders.

None were trees.
 There was really no vegetation at all, no greens, no browns.
 The entire layout was dark, ashen stones and aged wood that seemed to melt right in to the blue-gray of the mountain.
 The cloudy mist filtered the sun.
 I decided it was beautiful.
 “Where are we?” I asked.
 Chevelle nodded toward my hands as he started down the path.
 The map on my palms was gone.
 My skin was unmarked, no indication whatsoever it had even been burned.
 Is this our destination?

My pulse was already almost twice as fast as normal, and the room was just starting to wobble from side to side.
 Rachel was saying something, but I couldn't really hear her.
 The void was gaping below me, when something grabbed my shoulder and shook me surprisingly hard.
 I opened my eyes to see Rachel looking at me.
 "I'm sorry I had to do that, Adriana, but you need to hear what I have to say."
 Half of me wanted to be angry, but the other half just wanted to collapse into the void.
 Force of habit won over anger and I passively let my defenses crumble, but apparently being shocked out of a collapse functioned much the same as having just come out of an attack.
 For the next few seconds at least I was safe, could think about anything I wanted without fear of the repercussions.
 Only Rachel was talking, ruining my concentration, so the only thing I could focus on was her words.
 "The rumor revolves around the fact that you tragically lost your boyfriend in a vicious car wreck."

Now imagine that your car’s emergency brake is unexpectedly pulled— hard— your calm drive is suddenly spinning out of control.
 You don’t know which way to turn the wheel or what pedal to push.
 You just act and react and pray for the best all within a moment.
 And the car never regains control.
 That’s parenting.
 Chapter 13: Fatherhood 101 I had always promised myself I would do everything to be the father I never had.
 Sometimes you learn what to do from your experiences, and sometimes you learn what not to do.
 I had learned a lot of what not to do.
 My experience with my stepfather Dino was a nightmare itself, and then Richard wound up being real trouble.
 My mother had tried to warn me, but I wanted and needed to know for myself.

Qurrah read the name, and then glanced at his brother.
 “That is our last name.”
 Harruq nodded.
 “Aurelia showed me.
 T, u, n, she said.
 And then this sword here has our name…‌kind of.”
 Qurrah stared at the name, thinking.
 “He was an elf,” he said.
 “I guess it is possible he was our father, although I feel it more likely a coincidence.
 Our mother was intelligent, at least for an orc, but was she smart enough to leave us clues within our own names?”

You can move it, but only if you’re near.
 You can stop someone’s heart, but you can’t make them feel happy about it.” He hesitated after that last part, contemplating, and then continued, “You can manipulate the elements, move water, draw it from the ground, but you cannot easily make it appear from nothing… though one can usually collect moisture from the air.
 Fire is easier.
 It spreads so fast.
 You can pull a small spark from anywhere to create a flame, fueled by the air and…” He trailed off as I leaned closer to him, listening intently.
 Chevelle looked into my eyes, words forgotten.
 I didn’t know what he had seen there, but he blinked, shaking his head.
 “Let’s keep working.” He stepped a few paces away as he spoke.
 “You’ll need to think clearly and stay calm.
 The best fighters are the best thinkers.” “Fighters?” I asked, confused.

Deregulation of prices was the most prominent feature of the strategy in most countries, because it was the easiest to implement.
 But under conditions of shortages in economies dominated by huge monopolistic enterprises, price deregulation led to skyrocketing prices and spiralling inflation.
 A market flourishes only when several essential conditions are met – freedom of pricing, freedom of entry and exit from industry, free flow of information, unrestricted movement of goods and services, competition between enterprises, control of monopolies, and private ownership of property.
 The entire package of free market practices must be implemented hand in hand, otherwise it does not work.
 Freeing pricing without first regulating or dismantling monopolies, promoting privatization of land and enterprises, ensuring free flow of goods, and establishing wholesale markets and multiple distribution out lets lead to speculation, soaring prices, hoarding and falling production.
 Historically, the free market evolved over centuries in conditions of surplus production and stable currency, neither of which exist in Eastern Europe today.
 Efforts to accelerate the development of the market will have first of all to meet the political, legal, social and economic conditions historically required for its creation.
 And these conditions must be met simultaneously.
 4.Macro-economic stability is a precondition for increasing production: It is extremely difficult to increase production in a context of general macro-economic instability and hyperinflation.
 The rapidly falling value of local currencies minimized their utility as a medium of exchange.

Maybe he’s their idol or something.” I said.
 “Well,” Seth stated, “maybe we should ask the dwarfs where he is.” “That’ll be hard.” Emily pointed out.
 “They hardly tell us anything as it is.
 You try squeezing out information from one of these pests.” “I did.” “Whatever guys, we’re getting nowhere.
 Hey Emily you want to sleep over tonight?” I asked.
 Emily frowned, “It’s my turn, Jazell, and you’re coming over my house.” “Honestly, Em, just come over…” “No,” she said and crossed her arms stubbornly.
 I sighed and ran a hand through my hair, knowing it was useless to argue with her when her mind was made up.
 “Fine, I’ll call my parents.
 But next time you’re coming to my house.” She nodded, her curls bobbing.
 “Fair enough.” “Okay then, see you two later.” Jason turned around with Seth on his heels.

I considered the alternative—pierced through with arrows, blessed with a prayer—and I laughed.
 His eyes were intense as he reached to gently cup my neck, fingers resting at my spine, thumb grazing the base of my ear.
 I felt him urge me forward, and my breath caught, heart stuttering into a broken lope.
 And then Ruby was beside us from out of nowhere, her words startling me back to the cold, dull room.
 “They’re coming in.” Chevelle leaned back, his fingers brushing my collarbone when he pulled away.
 I bit my lip at the tingle that ran through me, and the corner of his mouth turned up into a different kind of smile.
 He stood to walk from the room and I stared at the stone entry, struggling to keep my thoughts from spinning out of control.
 Too much had happened.
 Too much was wrong.
 My life had flipped, twisted into some strange reflection of itself, and I couldn’t reconcile the fragments.

He nodded once and walked toward the rock ledge.
 Ruby bounced from foot to foot, celebrating her victory.
 As Chevelle moved past Anvil and Grey, they turned to follow him.
 The silver-haired elves and their dogs were nowhere in sight.
 My gaze caught Steed, who was watching me.
 I always forgot how strikingly handsome he was until I looked right at him.
 He wore a thin, loose shirt now, rolled at the sleeves and covered by a leather vest.
 It matched the long cuffs on his forearms, the same dark, worn leather of his saddles.
 He stepped closer, taking my chin in his hand to examine my face in the moonlight.
 He purred something toward Ruby about her decorations and gave me a wink as he walked off in the direction Chevelle had gone.

But, there are also deeper implications.
 The mating bond is one of the great sources of power for the AElf peoples,” he said.
 Rodregas did not understand fully what Jordaan meant but he suddenly added, “Then, if Imeralda is bonded to me, she will always try to keep her connection with me?” He asked a question, but he thought he already knew the answer.
 Jordaan nodded.
 “She will love others, but she is bonded to you for all time, until one of you dies.” Rodregas sat quietly, stunned by the news.
 No more words passed between the two until Jordaan was about to leave.
 “Do you know where the weapons are from the Immortal Guards?
 We are going to need them if we are going to do better during our next encounter.” Rodregas was getting his mind back to business; the news that he would never truly be separated from Imeralda revived his spirit.
 “Oh, we… took the weapons as salvage.
 It has helped to pay for your healing and equipping of the people you rescued.

“Chevelle… I…” I didn’t have an answer.
 What was I doing?
 He released his grip just a fraction.
 “I went to your room and you were gone.” He shook his head.
 “I thought I had to come out here to get a search party.” “I, uh… you were in my room?” He straightened, his expression making it clear he hadn’t expected that response.
 I pressed, taking the chance.
 “Why?” I heard movement behind me and the fear returned tenfold.
 Chevelle didn’t tense; he only let out an exasperated breath.
 “It’s fine,” he said.
 He released me and I turned to see who he’d addressed.

We were pressed up against one corner of the pavilion, with what I assumed was the rest of the pack between us and everyone else.
 For a moment the wall of bodies precluded figuring out what was going on, but then Isaac shifted slightly to the left, and I saw Brandon and Vincent through the gap.
 The pools of black where Vincent's eyes should have been finally made me aware of the prickle of energy arcing back and forth between the two rival groups.
 I couldn't imagine what it must feel like where Alec or Brandon were standing.
 Even just the fringe of power dancing over my arms and shoulders was enough to make me profoundly grateful I wasn't any closer to the epicenter.
 Vincent's sadistic smile sent shivers down my spine, but it was nothing compared to Brandon's expression.
 I'd known for a couple of weeks now that what the outside world saw was nothing more than a mask, but I hadn't realized just what was under the facade.
 Now I knew.
 It was like he'd spent the last few days peeling back some of the layers that'd hidden him, and the sheer inhumanity waiting underneath completely distracted me from the throbbing in my ankle.
 He held Britney before him, ostensibly caressing her, but in reality using her as a shield, his dark eyes daring Alec to attack.

Only a few of the guards would have had the power to use them and Ravenhurr kept guards with even small power away from the keep.
 Against the leather armor of the slavers there would be no defense, even if they had shields; the arrows would likely blast through anything they had.
 Of course, against the Immortalist guards it was a different matter; their armor would stop the arrows.
 And, of course, their weapons would be equally effective against his armor, going through it like butter and into his flesh if he was not fast enough.
 Depending on their sigils, they were likely to be either faster or stronger or both.
 But Rodregas’ short swords would not cut their armor.
 It put them at an extreme disadvantage.
 As the arrows flew over his head, he became aware of the other disadvantage of bows.
 They were dealing with a limited supply of arrows; once the arrows where all shot, they lost their main advantage.
 Rodregas heard the noise of the first soldier to rush from the road; he went low and swung hard.

I didn’t want brains splattered all over my truck, especially if they were mine!
 I was then shown pictures so I could verify Ashley and recognize Steve.
 It was her, and his head was practically shaved bald.
 He looked like your typical punk kid, just like Brandon.
 “Is his hair still that short?” I asked.
 “Not the last I saw.
 Why?” “Well, if his hair is longer, I can at least grab him by the head if he pulls a gun on me.” At this point I was given a lecture and the shots fired instructions again, because apparently I hadn’t gotten the message the first time.
 I was to stay in my truck and tell them to get in when they arrived.
 I was also told that the dealers would try to move me to another location and I was to stand my ground and never agree to move, even if it was just across the street.
 Steve had a warrant for his arrest in this county so he would attempt to avoid it.

It started to refract light, but there was only darkness around my vision of her.
 The wind picked up and her dark hair began to whip back and away from her face.
 She was smiling, glorious now, her arms outstretched.
 The pendant started to glow and the darkness cracked.
 The wind was howling.
 I could barely see.
 Or maybe something was covering my face.
 When I screamed the sound was lost.
 I tried again, but suddenly I was mute.
 Blind, mute and still.

The symbols on his body faded until they were but faint scars.
 “Give him his clothes,” Velixar ordered his student.
 Qurrah fetched a pair of black pants, a red shirt, and a black cloak, all of which Velixar had prepared before the brothers had brought the bloodless body to him.
 “Dress,” the necromancer ordered.
 Ahrqur growled some inane argument, but a glare from Velixar sent him cowering.
 “You must obey my every command, wretch, before you may return to the peaceful death you left.
 Fight me and you shall find your stay here lasting longer than your rotting body’s.”
 The undead Ahrqur whimpered.
 Qurrah watched the display, fighting against feelings of jealousy.
 He had commanded Ahrqur’s spirit to speak truthfully, but Velixar’s very glare sent him groveling to his knees.

A modest investment in new institutions to disseminate information can have an impact comparable to that of the information superhighways being heralded in the most industrially advanced nations – accelerating adoption of new activities, magnifying response to government programmes, and doubling the total developmental achievements of a country over the next five years.
 Information as a stimulus to transition
 The people of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are highly educated, but long deprived of free access to information.
 Recent economic reforms have dramatically increased the importance of information in the functioning of the economy.
 The breakdown of the command system necessitates the establishment of new channels for the dissemination of information about economic principles, commercial opportunities and successful practices within and outside the country.
 The macro-economic reforms introduced to free prices and legalize private property cannot generate the desired results, unless the population is also given easy access and exposure to a very wide range of essential in formation on new technologies, legal re forms, trade potentials, self-employment opportunities and modern management practices.
 The plethora of new laws, regulations and deregulations being enacted in these countries have left the population baffled and bewildered regarding what is now legal or illegal, acceptable or not permissible.
 The transition of these nations can be significantly accelerated by systematic dissemination of important information to the population regarding potentials in agriculture, industry, technology, commerce, management and law, as well as in politics, public administration, international relations, education, social institutions and health.
 Information needs of industrial nations
 Even in the information-rich West, where the average citizen is over whelmed by a continuous barrage of ideas, opinions and so-called ‘facts’ of varying accuracy and credibility from myriad sources, there is a need for more reliable information.

“Don’t touch,” barked Doi’van.
 Rodregas nodded, he knew not to touch, but then realized that his hand was raised and had been reaching out to stroke the lion’s mane.
 He knew that this was the greater sigil that he wanted to gain.
 It was in a perfect circle.
 He had taken in the essence of the Celestial Lion back at Raven Keep, and now Rodregas would consume his own magical power with the greater sigil of a Celestial Lion and become a perfect vessel for its power.
 Rodregas forced himself to step back.
 This was their chance for Doi’van, and he would get a second chance if needed.
 He looked over at the other two.
 Once Rodregas had turned around from the lion, Doi’van started to walk between the pedestals joining Imeralda at looking around.
 He stood in front of the great six-legged stallion, the kind of steed the Gods themselves ride, and then walked over to the Great White Stag of the forest and then to the giant eagle that guarded the Celestial sky.

Thoroughly soaked, he changed tactics and ran toward her.
 She screeched and started to run, but he seized her around the waist and grabbed the hose.
 "You're in trouble now."
 He released her and then squirted her.
 Laughing again, Marie twirled in the spray.
 "This is fun!"
 Rick shook his head, grinning.
 "What am I going to do with you?"
 Dropping the hose, he went to hug her.
 "You're absolutely incorrigible."

Rachel was waiting for me at the door as everyone else filed out.
 She looked up guiltily as I made my way over to her.
 "Did you have a good day?
 I haven't seen that many people here ever."
 If there was one thing that'd always pissed me off, it was people who refused to own up to their mistakes.
 In my mind not being where you said you were going to be, especially after being so jazzed about it previously, fit into that category.
 Rachel wasn't making a good start.
 "Why don't we cut to the chase, Rachel?
 You didn't go to Les Misérables.
 We spent more than a week planning what we were going to do on the way up and the way back, and you didn't bother to show up."

 "Is that where you live?"

 Ted whispered as Rick and Sharon were putting on their coats.
 "Yeah--I like her."
 "Good.

With a hesitant smile the green haired Nymph said, “We actually prefer the term Nymph of Life.
 Truly, life is as powerful an element as any.” “Sorry,” Rodregas said, realizing he had accidentally insulted the healer, “I have never spent much time with Nymphs.” Rodregas’ tone was quieter.
 The Nymph seemed young and smart and gifted.
 Rodregas knew he did not have to like him.
 But clearly from Imeralda’s introduction, this Nymph was well known and powerful among his people, and he had saved both Rodregas’ and Doi’van’s lives.
 There was an awkward moment until Doi’van appeared at the door.
 He walked with the help of a tall walking stick.
 His arm and side were both covered in bandages.
 Durien followed him in with a heavy stool, which Doi’van quickly sat down on.
 The old healer immediately left the room.

More importantly, where were they?
 “I don’t know,” she said finally.
 “I just don’t know.” “Oh no,” Jason said nervously.
 “When Emily doesn’t know, the world ends.
 Do you wish now that you were at home, curled up with a book?” “Yes.” *** “Seth,” I said, “calm down and think.
 We can’t stay here forever, and pace.”Seth didn’t stop and he started mumbling under his breath.
 I walked up and pushed him around.
 “Seth, you have to think.
 Kojas did this on purpose, he’s trying to weaken us by splitting us up.
 He wants us to go running to him.” “I know what he’s trying to do, it’s driving me crazy.

I settled deeper into my seat, opening my program as the orchestra started warming up.
 It was amazing to think the near-chaos currently drifting up from the pit would transform itself into the glorious strains of the Overture in just a few minutes.
 I was so intent on the program it should've taken a small explosion to bring my head around, but something caused me to look up as Alec walked past the drapes.
 He looked even more gorgeous than normal.
 I'd gone back and forth, both with myself, and with Rachel, on how much to dress up.
 Going in normal street clothes would've cheapened the experience, but I hadn't wanted to stick out too much from the rest of the kids, all of whom I'd been pretty sure would be in shorts and polos.
 I'd been right, which had made me glad I'd compromised and come in my one and only sun dress.
 Alec apparently hadn't gotten the memo.
 He was in an honest-to-goodness full tux.
 I wasn't the only one stunned by how good he looked; there was a ripple of turned heads as people noticed his entrance.

On the phone is lead undercover narcotics officer Denny White.
 Officer White wants to do a last minute sound check on the wire that I am wearing taped to my back.
 It seems that my lack of noise has caused the undercover officers who surround me in cars, vans and bushes to become concerned that they have lost sound.
 They haven’t heard a word from me since my last crack-berry conversation with Ashley, the suspect that I have set up in exchange for dropping pending drug dealing charges.
 They are not my charges.
 They belong to my son.
 He is the real drug dealer.
 I’m just trying to be a good dad.
 My last conversation with Ashley seemed a little muffled and the cops want to make sure they get a clear recording of the drug deal.
 The reason I am here and have insisted that I do this is complicated.

"Yes?"
 She opened the door.
 "Oh, I'm sorry, Father.
 I thought you were alone."
 "That's all right, my dear.
 Mr. Lawson and I were just concluding our business."
 He stood, addressing the young man who'd risen when Marie entered.
 "I don't believe you've met my daughter.
 Marie, this is Daniel Lawson.
 He's just bought that piece of land I'd intended to use for a warehouse a few years ago."

The feeling of insects marching across my skin intensified as James started shaking.
 Jasmin and Dominic both followed suit within seconds, and the feeling doubled as several of Brandon's wolves went into near convulsions.
 "I said break it up!"
 Mr. Paterson shoved his way past a pair of Brandon's wolves, and for a split second I thought they were going to turn and kill him.
 A heartbeat before they moved a low, barely perceptible growl washed over the entire scene.
 I realized that the sound was coming from Alec, spreading out from him in ripples of calm.
 As the noise touched the shaking wolves in either pack, they calmed down, saving Mr. Paterson from injury he'd never even seen coming.
 "This ends now.
 I don't care who started what, you guys are done dancing.
 Alec, you and your friends leave now.

The man had not flinched.
 “I shall take that as your answer,” Antonil shouted to the town.
 “Woodhaven desires death.”
 He drew his sword and spoke softly.
 “So be it.”
 Elves appeared in the windows of every building that lined the center.
 Full quivers hung from their backs.
 Sixty more elves joined their lone companion on the street and readied their bows.
 The men in the center raised their shields, but they knew the deadly aim of a trained elf.
 They were about to be massacred.

“Why did you not do that to the gate?” he asked.
 “I can let us pass but a single object at a time,” Qurrah whispered.
 “The bars had gaps between them.”
 Harruq gestured to the room.
 “Amazing no one ever robbed this guy before,” he said.
 Qurrah shot him a glance, his meaning clear.
 The half-orc shrugged, drew his swords, and began walking.
 A sleek staircase led to the upper floor, while through the hallway they could see a room with an iron stove and shelves for storing food.
 “Which way do we go?” Harruq asked.
 “Up,” Qurrah said.

Harruq struggled to his feet, clutching his neck as he gasped for air.
 “Damn elf,” he cursed.
 “How dare you threaten us.”
 His hands shook violently as his adrenaline faded.
 He had been terrified, convinced the elf would kill him, yet he didn’t.
 “Big mistake, elfie,” he said.
 He snatched his swords and sheathed them.
 “I’ll make you pay for that.”
 After a bit of debate, he decided not to tell Qurrah.
 Velixar had already made it clear they needed to be careful.

Eugene – Oh not that again.
 What caused the return that small piece of delusional fantasy?
 It was funny the first time, but it’s lost some of its charm in each re-telling.
 Jim – It’s not fantasy damn it.
 The Canadians are coming.
 Eugene – Sure they are.
 Johnny – Right after the Martians.
 Jim – I hope you like watching hockey, because in a few short years it’s all that will be on television.
 Mark my words.
 Eugene – Your words are marked.

What I want to say—the difference is not a drama, the difference is a poem, a song, a way of looking at life, that’s slightly atilt, slightly askew, perhaps, but it’s all me, you know?
 It’s what I am.
 I am a songwriter.
 That was finding my soul.

Efforts to accelerate the dismantling of both trade and non-trade barriers should be viewed as a central element of a global strategy to stimulate employment generation.
 6.Debt repayments: The debt problem is a major obstacle to the development and welfare of at least 60 heavily indebted, developing countries, including two-thirds of the world's poorest nations.
 Most of these countries suffered a decline in per capita income over the past decade and are now in arrears with more than 20 per cent of their debt obligations.
 The debt burden discourages new foreign investment and lending to these coun tries and prevents them from stimulating economic growth through additional domestic savings and investment.
 International debt relief has helped ten, mostly middle-income, debtor countries significantly reduce their commercial debt.
 Past actions to relieve the debt burden on low-income countries have been relatively small in relation to the amount of debt, which has continued to rise under the combined impact of accumulated interest arrears on old loans, falling export commodity prices, and new compensatory loans, frequently given on expensive terms.
 Unrealistic pressure to repay debt undermines debtors' capacity for constructive initiative.
 Past experience has shown that mere debt rescheduling in these countries does not solve the problem and may in fact aggravate it.
 The extent of the problem is reflected in the heavily discounted prices of the debts of countries with low and lower-middle incomes in the secondary market and in negotiated buy-outs of the debt owed to commercial creditors.
 In 1993, the average market price of the debt was about 30 cents on the dollar.

She would have blushed if her entire body weren’t already on fire.
 Rick wasn't her husband.
 And he never would be.
 For that reason, she shouldn't make love with him .
 .
 .
 but for that reason, she wanted to make love with him.
 But how could she do that and then leave him forever?
 How could she give herself to him so completely and then walk away from him?
 With effort, she made herself roll off him, but she couldn't resist cuddling up against him.

The acquisition of even modest defensive capabilities may consume a significant portion of national income when the economic base is small, as it is for many of these nations.
 In addition, the increasing incidence of war, terrorism and drug-related violence in the developing world has heightened the sense of insecurity among these countries.
 However, a closer analysis reveals that half of the military expenditure of the developing world is incurred by a small number of oil-exporting countries in the Middle East and North Africa, and another quarter is incurred by other high-income developing nations, mostly in East and South East Asia – whereas the 84 developing nations with lower and lower-middle incomes, including such large nations as China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Bangladesh, comprising 72 per cent of the world’s population, incur roughly 6 per cent of global military expenditure, on average less than 3 per cent of the total GDP of these countries.
 International pressure for defining acceptable levels of military expenditure and reducing defence budgets is entirely warranted, provided that it is applied equitably to all countries, takes into account the varying conditions between regions and nations, and places corresponding limitations on arms exports by industrialized nations.
 Placed under the control of an impartial international agency specialized in security issues, rather than being left to development banks or made an instrument of bilateral policy by donor nations, these measures could effect a further 50 to 75 per cent cut in global defence spending and thereby generate $400 billion to $600 billion per year for non-military purposes, equal to roughly ten times current levels of overseas development assistance.
 The international community should commit itself to a minimum goal of reducing global military expenditure to $400 billion (in 1992 constant dollars) by 2000 AD.
 Military expenditure mitigates but does not resolve the underlying problem of security.
 Today, the most pressing security threats are social, not military.
 The appropriate response to them is greater investment in sustainable human development, not more arms.
 However, preservation of physical security against external aggression is a primal instinct of nation states that cannot be rationalized away.

“I desire panic and bloodshed all across the east!”
 Aurelia summoned a magical shield about her body.
 The fireballs thudded three feet from her body and detonated.
 The two nearest buildings crumpled, their walls and roofs blown back by the power.
 The elf winced, nearly knocked to her knees by the force.
 “What madness gives you such a desire?” she asked, sending forth the strongest spells she knew.
 Several lances of ice flew down the street, followed by a ball of magma.
 The ball rolled behind the lances, covering the ground in flame.
 Velixar laughed.
 A wave of his hand created a similar shield as Aurelia’s, but instead of keeping it close to his body, he shoved it forward.

Privatization and restructuring of public sector companies in response to fiscal pressures has had a similar effect.
 In the United Kingdom alone, an estimated 500,000 jobs will be lost for this reason in 1994.
 The impact of structural adjustments programmes has slowed economic growth and new job creation in a number of developing countries.
 Gains in productivity due to new technology, particularly delayed gains from the micro-computer revolution of the 1980s and the growth of factory automation, have slowed job growth in some industries.
 The increasing competitiveness of the NIEs of Asia and most recently China has displaced jobs in the West, primarily unskilled jobs.
 The major impact of several of these factors has already been felt and is now beginning to subside.
 Some will continue for several more years.
 Still others may entirely reverse their direction and contribute to job growth later in the decade.
 Not one is an irreversibly negative factor that will continue to exert a downward pressure on job growth for the foreseeable future.

 look."
 Marie smiled.
 She hadn't even thought about binding her chest again, a convention that her mother had never understood or liked.
 She'd always thought she was too well endowed to look good in any of the clothes she liked, but now she couldn't imagine binding it.
 Besides, she liked wearing the lacy bras she'd brought from 2011.
 "Marie," her mother said quietly, taking her daughter's arm as they left the store, "does the young man you met have anything to do with your decision to stop binding your chest?"
 "He just told me that that's not the style in--where he lives.

Aurelia swore as she heard what they said.
 “They call me traitor,” she said.
 “I protected you, and now I am a traitor.”
 The half-orc stepped before her, preparing his swords.
 “They won’t touch you.”
 “I know,” Aurelia said, summoning the last bit of magic inside her.
 A tear in the fabric of reality ripped open, swirling with white and blue magic.
 “Get in,” she yelled.
 “What about Qurrah?” he shouted.
 “Go inside, you dumb fool!”

 She went to the bathroom for some tissue.
 "Marie?"
 Rick called after her, standing up.
 He started to follow her, but she returned seconds later.
 "What's wrong?"
 "I don't want to use your handkerchief.
 I want to keep it and take it home with me.
 It-it smells like you."
 He smiled, stroking her hair.

And, it took me years to figure out what was going on.
 It was my mother, see.
 She thought music was not the kind of career a really useful cog in society’s machine should pursue.
 And she would be damned if her child was going to follow in his father’s footsteps.
 Why I never heard my dad practice at the house.
 Why, even his record collection of big band and swing music stayed dusty.
 My mother squelched my father, I think.
 Held him back.
 I think my father was a man with a lot of soul, a lot of creativity that just festered, just rotted inside him like cancer, until, well, it turned to cancer and that killed him.
 CM:  	But, he was a lifelong smoker.

Rachel pulled her things together and left while I was straightening up the chairs.
 It was petty, but I waited inside the room until the clock showed exactly the time the lab was supposed to finish, and then joined Britney outside in the oppressive heat.
 The air was so dry I could nearly feel it pulling the moisture out of my body as we started around the school towards where Britney had parked her car.
 As we reached the west side of the building, the high-pitched growl of a performance engine tore a hole in the relative silence.
 The edge of the student parking lot was just barely in view now, but it was enough to see the source of the noise.
 A tiny figure barely recognizable as Rachel, was walking towards a dark-blue bullet bike, which had just roared to life.
 We had to walk several more steps before I recognized the leather-clad, dark-haired figure on the bike as Alec.
 My feet must have unconsciously slowed because Britney was now several steps ahead of me and looking back impatiently.
 I tried to catch up, but Alec chose that moment to look up and stare in our direction.
 He was quite a ways away, and his lovely eyes were covered by a pair of sunglasses, but I somehow knew he was looking at me.

"Of course, Jess.
 We figured you wanted some privacy with Isaac, or we would've dragged you over here hours ago."
 The rest of us were quick to pipe in, but at least on my side, the sentiment was a little half-hearted.
 Unlike Jasmin, Jessica never had come around, never made her peace with the fact that because of me things were going to go downhill in a hurry after tonight.
 I'd tried to get both Rachel and Dominic to explain why she hated me so much, but neither would give me a real explanation.
 Rachel would always just get mad and say there was no excuse for how Jess was acting.
 Dominic always refused to say anything other than that Jessica had been through her own set of struggles, and had her reasons for her behavior.
 "I'll be done with Dom in just a moment, Jess, then I'll fix your hair while Rachel finishes up with Adri."
 The nickname should have hurt, but somehow it wasn't as bad when the pack used it.
 It was almost like having a new family, one without all of the grief-poisoned memories that popped up every time I really thought about Dad or Cindi.

He drew his swords and flung them aside, not daring to have their touch near him just then.
 Velixar’s voice throbbed in his ears, a chant of promises and loyalty.
 “Deny the gift,” Aurelia said, the faintest hint of magic on her fingertips.
 “Give me some shred of hope.”
 He closed his eyes.
 Tears trickled down his face.
 He felt the anger growing inside him, but he forced it down.
 In his mind’s eye, he saw Velixar.
 The old prophet warned of death, retribution, and pain, but Harruq silenced him.
 Let the gift be gone.

The story of this world’s gods is not lengthy, nor complicated, but it is a story that you must learn.
 “Celestia created the rock, the grass, and the water.
 Her hand formed the wildlife, and to tend her creation she created elves.
 The goddess gave them long life and abundant land so quarrels within their race were of the petty sort.
 Then the brother gods came.
 Ashhur of Justice, Karak of Order.
 There are many worlds beyond our own, Qurrah.
 I have seen fleeting glimpses of them in my dreams.
 Karak and Ashhur came from one of those worlds, and Celestia welcomed them.
 To them she gave the grasslands and rolling hills.

"What do you mean?
 I've only met her the one time.
 She seemed normal enough.
 I guess a little distracted..." The chuckle I'd been waiting for surfaced, but it wasn't at all like his normal laugh.
 It was as if someone had sucked all of the joy and goodness out of the sound I'd grown to crave on a nearly subconscious level, and left a twisted shell.
 "She's definitely distracted.
 You could even say utterly disconnected from the world.
 Completely free from the present, always living in the past."
 "I don't understand how any of this ties together."
 He looked up at me for the first time, and the tortured look in his eyes made me hold onto his hand as tightly as I was able.

"I was supposed to have been with them."
 My shoulders suddenly relaxed as everything started to make sense.
 There'd been an attack of course.
 There might have even been a bit of a cover-up by local, or regional, authorities, but Britney's father was probably right in assuming the motivation had been protecting the tourist industry.
 That was all straightforward, but even that wasn't as obvious as the fact that Britney was suffering from some kind of survivor's guilt.
 She felt like she was somehow to blame for not dying with her friends, and was reading all kinds of motivations into people's behavior that weren't even there.
 That would've been spooky enough, but then I'd turned around, linked all of it to a freak nightmare and been convinced the world was about to end.
 Silly.
 I did my best to comfort Britney after that, but was more than a little relieved when lunch finally ended.
 That of course made me feel heartless and guilty in turn, but I was still too fragile to deal with her issues.

I loosened the wet corset ties and dropped the dress into a pile at my feet, shivering as I stepped free of it and onto a rock.
 I grabbed a shirt from the pile, and then the slim pants, aware of how nice the fabric felt, how good the cut.
 A leather vest laced over the top.
 It seemed they were tailored for me.
 I’d never had such luck making my own clothes.
 These were trim and fit, made for traveling.
 Not that I knew where I was going.
 My desire to trail Chevelle had been smashed, but there was no way I could return to the village.
 I glanced around.
 Still no sign of the watchers as I slid my shoes on.

If the events of the past seven years prove anything, it is that a massive change of attitude and perspective, such as the one brought about between East and West, is imminently possible and incredibly powerful.
 The one we have all been party to has immensely altered the world’s political and economic landscape – sweeping away at a single stroke the very real danger of another world war and widespread nuclear destruction.
 The recommendations formulated in this report call for profound changes in the way we think, feel and act to meet the challenges and tap the opportunities of the coming decade.
 We should not underestimate the magnitude of the changes required or the collective effort needed to bring them about.
 Nor, as recent events confirm, should we under estimate the capacity of humankind to make these changes and realize the benefits.
 During the twentieth century, humankind has achieved an unprecedented mastery of its physical and social environment – soaring into space and landing on the moon, exploring the ocean floors, harnessing the power of the atom, delving into the secrets of the human brain and creating machines that imitate many of its functions, unravelling our own genetic code, generating unimagined wealth for many, proliferating national and global institutions, evolving the rudimentary foundations of world governance.
 Yet the very magnitude of these accomplishments has generated a sense of dependence and even helplessness.
 Our own creations have cast a spell over us.
 Impressed by the power of our works, we feel obliged to submit to our own incomplete and sometimes faulty constructions, rather than to complete or modify them to better meet our needs.
 Instead of marvelling at the wondrous achievements of the modern era, we should marvel at the unlimited human capacity for invention and progress.

 I'll go take care of some stuff then.
 You two enjoy all of that math, and I'll see you tomorrow morning.
 Maybe you'll even wait for me at your house this time."
 It unsettled me a little that such a simple statement could cause industrial-sized butterflies to spontaneously appear in my stomach, so I tried to push the thought out of my mind.
 I hesitantly returned Rachel's tentative smile, and then dug into my homework.
 Mrs. Campbell stopped by for a few minutes, obviously checking to make sure that I was over my aberrant behavior from yesterday.
 I got the feeling she would've liked to chat for a bit longer, but we had the predictable surge in attendance given the coming test.
 I gave her my best reassuring smile as she left, and then watched as she and the other tutors all bounced from one student to the next answering questions.
 As much as I would have liked to just call it a day, another good effort added to what I'd done earlier would put me two or maybe even three days ahead of my personal schedule.

It was already making my hair flap all over the place.
 I heard Seth huff out and I turned.
 He gave me a face and said, “Your hair keeps getting in my face.” I turned back around.
 “Deal.” We turned in the air and I could see the mountains in the distance.
 They were small but were growing fast as we neared them.
 I could feel the dragon’s muscles pump underneath my legs.
 Small gusts of air rolled off the dragon’s wings that blew Emily’s hair in her face.
 I smiled as she raked the pink strands out of her mouth.
 We dipped down and I felt the “stomach-in-your-chest” feeling you usually get from rollercoasters.
 I closed my eyes and tried to ignore it but I couldn’t.

(laughs)  I guess he can’t be reincarnated unless he’s dead.
 Creole, you do the research, man, find out if Buddy’s still with us (laughs) and make me sound sensible here, dig?
 I want this to have some semblance of significance  Some sense of time.
 If I’ve got stuff out of sequence, put in stuff that I couldn’t have known at that time, you straighten it out, right?
 You make it into the story of my life.
 You’re the man, you’re the storyteller.
 I leave it all in your capable hands.
 This is just a collection of ramblings, right?
 Hey, man, what are you gonna do with this shit?
 It suddenly occurred to me, what if this doesn’t make sense?

Very likely, he believed it might be death.
 He told Kenny to leave Billy and me at home.
 In some way he wanted to spare us.
 I used to suppose he hadn't exactly known his motive, only felt that whatever was coming at him, we shouldn’t have to witness.
 The only sense I could make of it all was that something way beyond reason or observation took place in his heart, mind or spirit.
 According to some mysterious cosmic whimsy or brutal plan, Eric had to die and I didn’t.
 So I filed the matter away with other mysteries, of which life offers plenty.
 But on this trip with all its remembering, I may solve the mystery.
 The End of Something Else
 A couple weeks after Eric's funeral, Cliff and I decided we should quit school and move to San Francisco.

Um.
 It was at the Shell.
 Black Lung was playing, one of our first headlining gigs, I think.
 I came off stage after the encore, after we’d done a cooking version of “I Love my Aunt Jemima,” Skippy going wild like a man possessed, and maybe he was, man, maybe he was.
 This was Memphis, those things are real, man.
 No one looks askance at a little theurgy, you know, a little of that Memphis Mojo, that hoodoo that brought us everything from W. C. to Isaac to Booker to Big Star to Jism.
 I been playing rock, blues, jazz, ruckus, fife-and-drum, what have you, all my life.
 Call it what you want.
 Good music, man, always out of that town on the river.
 You think that’s just coincidence.

It’s no real wonder why he’s so damn angry with us all.
 I just hope we can reach to him before he decides to get revenge on life for the lot he has been cast.
 I don’t know how I would try to reach him in your place.
 Just try.
 Jim – As I said, I’ll do what I can.
 But I think he’s going to either end up dead in an ally or in a psycho ward somewhere.
 He still hates mother with all his being.
 Art – She really messed him up, but hopefully we can help him let go, and then heal.
 If we can’t help I’m afraid he might have to go see a psychiatrist.
 Jim – He still has the letter.

“Any question you or I ask he must answer truthfully.
 Do not be disturbed by the sound he first makes.
 Spirits brought back into our world rarely enjoy the journey.”
 Harruq nodded, dressed in his black armor.
 They did not have much time before Velixar’s dark cloud arrived.
 They could not rush, but nor could they dawdle.
 Qurrah inhaled deeply and began casting his spell.
 The words of magic were similar to those when he raised the eight corpses back in Cornrows.
 The bigger half-orc was aware of subtle differences, but had little clue to what they were.
 Words of power were beyond his understanding.

Harruq removed his armor, lay down on the bed of straw, and slept.
 The necromancer stepped outside his home, walked to the side, and stared at the flickering lights in the distance.
 Campfires and torches.
 An army, the same that had removed him and his brother from their home, slept so close.
 Every one of them contemplated their death.
 Qurrah closed his eyes and inhaled the cold night air.
 Yes, the tension was delectable.
 The quiet moments before battle were a rare thing that so very few were lucky enough to experience.
 Fear, worry, hope, prayer, regret, and sorrow all floated to the stars.
 The half-orc let his attuned mind drink it all in.

“Do you really believe such nonsense?” “What nonsense?
 It isn’t real?” He let out a harsh laugh and I jerked back.
 “Oh, I suppose it’s real.
 The service is real.
 Honestly, Freya, don’t you see?” “See what?” I cursed my bound brain.
 “Grand Council.” I drew a sharp breath at the words.
 “The calling is simply service to Grand Council.
 A hundred years of servitude under the guise of duty and honor.
 What is honorable about doing their bidding?” “So you don’t… answer the call?” I stumbled, searching for words.
 His laughter was a roar.

He walked with a definite limp, one that was all the more painful when contrasted against his otherwise graceful movements.
 I looked questioningly at Alec, but he shook his head, so I stayed quiet as he led me into the house.
 Rachel was waiting for us in a luxuriously-furnished sitting room.
 "Mother's been asking for you, Alec.
 I told her you'd be back soon, but she's worried."
 "I suppose this is a good opportunity to introduce Adriana."
 For the first time since I'd found out about Alec's secret, Rachel was looking uncertain.
 She was suddenly the old Rachel I knew from school instead of the confident young woman who'd helped face down three terrifying shape shifters intent on sending me back to Brandon.
 "Are you sure, Alec?
 I could go help her get settled into the Lilac Room."

Had I been less arrogant, I might've turned to theology instead, and perhaps become truly wise.
 I’m fairly bright, but slow.
 When a new idea arises, I only ponder until my brain begins to hurt.
 Then I let the idea go until the next time it surfaces.
 For months, on and off, ever since the song alerted me, I have pondered the idea of Eric as more than a sensitive fellow with clairvoyant powers and a tremendous heart who chose to protect Bill Torrey and me.
 I have asked, how much did he know?
 I had always supposed his prescience was shadowy.
 But maybe not.
 By that Sunday morning when he showed up at Kenny Niedermeyer's, he might have gotten the whole message.
 I think about standing outside the basketball gym a month before his last day, when Eric could easily have run like he insisted Billy and I do.

"I'm sorry, sweetheart—I never considered that living here with me might make you uncomfortable."
 "It doesn't.
 I feel as safe with you as I do in my own home.
 I just--it's just that no one else would understand."
 "Well, don't worry about Teri.
 I won't tell her, and she's going to love you."
 They went into the kitchen to fix breakfast.
 Marie glanced at Rick as he poured juice.
 When he noticed her glance, she dropped her eyes to the bread she was buttering.
 "Rick," she began at last, "do you remember when you first kissed me?"

A number of factors are posing serious obstacles to productivity growth and threaten even current levels of production.
 Of the poor, 80 per cent in Latin America, 60 per cent in Asia and 50 per cent in Africa live on marginal land of low productivity and high susceptibility to environmental degradation.
 Raising productivity on these lands can be extremely difficult.
 Quality farmlands are being lost at an astonishing rate to diversion for non-farm uses, desertification, deforestation, soil erosion, and the depletion and pollution of water resources.
 These factors have resulted in the degradation of nearly one billion hectares worldwide since the Second World War.
 In addition, climatic changes resulting from the increased emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere are expected to exert additional negative impact over the long term, the extent of which is difficult to assess.
 Opportunities in Agriculture
 Rapid and sustained expansion of food and agricultural production cannot be achieved without concerted efforts to address these factors.
 At the same time there are a number of positive factors that offer opportunities to increase productivity significantly in the near to middle term.
 Closing the productivity gap

She said she couldn’t drag herself out of bed when it was so gloomy.
 Marie decided she’d ask Grace to make her a waffle this morning.
 She’d like cherries and whipped cream on it.
 She’d go shopping with her mother and maybe have lunch in town.
 After lunch she’d come home to take a nap.
 The house would be hot in the afternoon.
 “Don’t forget to pick up the dry cleaning!” Marie jumped, looking up to see who’d yelled.
 A car door slammed, and she saw a sleek gray car back out of a driveway.
 She’d wandered far from Rick’s house .

Brandon’s counseling had revealed several things that had caused him to bury himself in drugs and he was learning how to manage those painful experiences.
 One big event was when our son received a call from another friend of his while we were away on a family vacation.
 The friend told Brandon that his best friend, Tom, had been in a horrible car accident and was near death.
 Our son, like Tom, just sixteen years old, was hysterical, and we returned home immediately.
 It seemed like half of the high school was holding a vigil at the hospital when we arrived.
 Tom was paralyzed from the waist down in the accident.
 Car washes were held as fundraisers for this handsome and popular young man whose family had no health insurance.
 Tom was always such a bright spot and had an infectious personality.
 As time went on Brandon never stopped being his best friend.
 At sixteen years old Brandon was helping his young friend with everything from carrying him into a car or up the stairs to helping him on the toilet or into a bath.

I may die, but if I win I can earn a greater sigil, maybe even bring you into the chamber as my servant.
 If both Doi’van and I had a greater sigil, we would be much more likely to survive the upcoming battles,” Rodregas said.
 “We would still get spitted like a pig to the roast without decent armor,” said Doi’van, “but as the Gods have yet to provide the armor, we will show these human squires the armor of our faith and the armor of our courage.
 I just don’t like having to watch you fight such battles and not be able to fight myself.” growled Doi’van.
 “Yeah, what he said,” Imeralda stated, ”I wish I could do the bow competition for you.
 I could get you five points there even with a regular bow, otherwise I am happy to watch you big boys show how tough and strong you are.” Rodregas smiled at Doi’van’s and Imeralda’s courage even though their personalities were opposites.
 Imeralda was as light hearted as Doi’van was thoughtful.
 “One question,” Rodregas asked, “do we actually have a hammer or a mace?”
 Two days later the dawn found Rodregas facing his first opponent.
 This first foe looked very young.

Why keep looking if it’s easy to find?
 What were we talking about?
 CM:  	Uh…some people see in your “California” LPs a kind of return to innocence, a willful perspective that is more Edenic, or childlike.
 Would you say that you are seeking innocence with your recent work, that you are moving toward artlessness?
 BG:  	You would say that.
 I think you just did say that.
 Artlessness?
 Hm.
 I wouldn’t have used that word, but I like it.
 Yes, strip off the artifice, cut off the fat.

So serious and worried all the time.
 Oh, how I miss him."
 Alec let his mother take both of his hands in hers.
 "I know you do, Mother.
 Rachel and I miss him too."
 Alec's mom tossed her head.
 "You barely remember him.
 Rachel's a good girl, but she was so young when he died.
 She can't really miss him.
 Not like I miss him."

"One of these days you're going to go ahead and wait for me at your house, and then I'll know you finally trust me."
 I didn't feel much like playful banter, but I marshaled a semi-convincing smile and gave it my best go.
 "Oh, I trust you, I just know that you've got more important things to worry about.
 One of these times you'll either forget to come get me, or you'll forget to tell me you're not coming by anymore."
 Brandon let the silence build for several seconds.
 "I'd try and convince you I'm not going to do any of that to you, but I suspect that's just going to take time."
 I was busy kicking myself for having cast such a pall over the morning, when Brandon sighed.
 "We should talk about what happened to you yesterday."
 "I don't know what you're talking about.
 Nothing happened."

“You’ll need to think clearly and stay calm.
 The best fighters are the best thinkers.” “Fighters?” I asked, confused.
 He shook his head again, as if clearing it.
 There was a long pause as I waited for his answer.
 “I’d like you to practice just for protection.” “I have fire.” He picked up a fallen branch, long and jagged, and snapped the smaller twigs from its side.
 “Yes, but you should learn to think more openly.
 It is an important resource and should be familiar to you.
 You should have years of experience by now.” “Why don’t I?” He stopped.
 I could tell by his expression he hadn’t meant to say so.
 “Why can’t I use magic?” I clarified.

It can mark a decisive transition or staging ground for speeding humanity’s evolutionary progression.
 The remarkable events of the past few years – the fall of the Berlin Wall, the turn to democracy in the former USSR and other countries of Eastern Europe, the peaceful end of apartheid in South Africa, and concrete steps toward lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians – confirm this truth.
 In an age of incredibly rapid and revolutionary change, who can confidently claim the wisdom to predict what can or cannot be accomplished in the coming decade?
 Looking back on this moment ten years from now, we may well be able to chronicle what now appear as equally extraordinary achievements.
 The glimpse of possible changes in the world over the next decade afforded in the box on pages 7–8 may appear outlandish and unrealistic to some.
 It is an indication of what is possible, not a prophecy or projection of what is inevitable.
 It presents a set of real opportunities that can be tapped, provided that we take best advantage of the present situation.
 The progress it heralds is no more inconceivable and remarkable than the chain of recent achievements seemed seven years ago – yet those we have already come to take for granted and, underinsistent prodding by the media, to replace in our consciousness with ever new concerns.
 PROSPECTS FOR THE YEAR 2005

I opened my mouth to try and calm Britney down, but she cut me off.
 "You don't understand how much influence they have.
 Three years ago someone tried to start a newspaper in Sanctuary.
 Things were going along just fine until he pissed off Alec's mother.
 The city condemned the building and refused to change the zoning laws so he could get another place.
 When he really pushed the issue, his house mysteriously caught on fire."
 My mouth was hanging open, but Britney seemed to think it was disbelief rather than amazement.
 "I'm serious, Adriana, and I'm not letting you take my family down with you.
 Find your own way home."
 Chapter 6 There was no reason for Britney's actions to come as any kind of surprise, it was exactly in keeping with her character.

Hell, we’d probably still be together.
 So, we didn’t do that.
 And we didn’t do Wattstax, either.
 (laughs)  It’s funny now, but, at the time, it seemed to sound some kind of death knell to us.
 Or maybe just to me.
 I felt marginalized, like we were from this backwater town and everything was happening elsewhere, like you know, how everybody in Memphis feels about New York, or it was San Francisco for a while.
 That inferiority thing.
 Of course, it’s only in retrospect that you see what Memphis had, what we had going on there, right around the corner.
 I mean, everybody wants to know if I know Elvis, you know.
 Everybody asks me that, everybody even in the business.

We were outside the stone walls of the fortress finding sparse greens to eat, which bored me even in a dream.
 I encouraged the horse to run and he responded immediately, taking flight down the mountainside.
 The rocks streaked past us as we ran faster and faster, the wind whipping his mane.
 A great bird perched on the dead limb of an ironwood tree and I jumped to it just as it dropped from the branch and flared its wings out to catch the wind.
 We flew still farther as I watched the mountain pass below.
 There was a scrubby patch of trees ahead and I could see movement there, inside.
 I tried to focus on it… familiar silver and white.
 Commotion brought me back and I sat up, startled.
 My head spun.
 Ruby caught my arm to steady me.

What good would it do them?” Doi’van tossed his wild black mane of hair and his eyes lighted with rage.
 Rodregas suddenly realized that he better not feed the Hellborn’s rage.
 Those with Infernal blood were known for their berserker rages.
 They seldom survived the rampages, but were nearly unstoppable when they fell into one.
 Rodregas breathed deeply, trying to lower his own anger and frustration.
 Jordaan stepped outside the room Rodregas had been staying in and into the small clearing that was the center of the Nymph Dwello, the tent like structure that they used for houses.
 “Gentleman, please,” said Jordaan.
 “You must have understood that this village took a great risk in taking you, and those you rescued, in.
 The only way Imeralda was able to get their support was to offer the bounty of the Immortal Guard’s equipment.” As if called from Jordaan’s words, Imeralda landed in the clearing, seemingly leaping from one of the nearby trees.
 She looked a bit out of breath, like she had sprinted at a run to the Dwello.

“Ready to resume training?” he asked.
 That cooled the flush and I grimaced, moving to stand.
 I hadn’t done so since the incident and my head spun.
 I wobbled, and Chevelle was suddenly there, steadying me.
 I shook off his look of concern.
 “I’m fine.
 Really.” He shifted closer and I became wholly aware of his hands at my waist.
 The grip he’d used to steady me became softer and yet, at the same time, his fingers tightened around me.
 My breath hitched as he pulled me against him, the length of our bodies touching.
 My throat went dry, black spots swirling in my vision.

Johnny – So, where’s the downside to that?
 Jim – It’s just not Gene’s way.
 He likes to create a nuisance and a spectacle.
 He’s better at the former than at the latter, but he does try.
 If people found out that his father beat him, well they would explain away his actions with some text-book psychology and do more to try and ignore him.
 That would really piss Gene off.
 I think that he just likes the attention that he receives.
 Johnny – If it’s true…
 Jim – If what’s true?
 Johnny – The beatings.

Qurrah could see its flickers of light, and even in his little pit he felt the heat.
 His whole body ached, and he wished nothing more than to lay there like a corpse in a grave, but he had no time.
 He needed to take care of the meddlesome elves that had him pinned.
 “Like shadows in the night,” he whispered, remembering how Velixar had described a certain spell to him.
 “Shadows that vanish and reappear at will.”
 He spoke the words and poured his power into them.
 He felt his body shift, and his sight twisted so that he saw many things.
 A spider, he thought.
 Velixar should have told him it was like becoming a spider.
 A mere thought of moving sent him spiraling, reappearing place to place.

Emily added, Toad Dwarf told Seth, “You won’t stop him, little warrior.” Does this mean he’s powerful?
 “Did you have to add the ‘little warrior’ part?
 It makes me sound weak.” Seth complained.
 “I did because we need all the facts.
 It’s obvious the dwarf was trying to make you sound weak anyway.
 Now what did he tell you, Jason?” “He said, ‘He will destroy all half-lings.’ What’s that supposed to mean, anyway?” Jason said.
 She added the last bullet; Toad Dwarf said to Jason, “He will destroy all half-ling.” What does “half-ling mean?
 “Did the dwarfs tell you anything?” I asked, taking the paper.
 None of what she wrote on the paper made any sense to me.
 She shook her head.

It's how I always imagined an angel would appear."
 Alec was silent for so long I finally tore my gaze from his masterpiece long enough to find that he was staring at me with surprise.
 "It's you, Adri.
 Of course it's beautiful."
 For a second I couldn't breathe.
 It seemed so utterly impossible.
 Maybe it could've been a painting of Cindi, but not one of me.
 I couldn't possibly be the gorgeous figure he'd brought to life on his canvas.
 I opened my mouth to protest, and then the expression on her face finally registered for me.
 Compassion.

Alec seemed like the type who'd force a decision just because he could.
 I felt my heart go crazy at the same time tears started gathering at the corner of my eyes.
 It was stupid to have risked a panic attack when I was already borderline depressed, but that was what I was looking at now.
 I'd picked a seat that wasn't visible from the doorway, so I just put my head down and let the twin traumas run their course.
 By the time I was feeling steady enough to leave the classroom, I had just enough time to make it to the bathroom and try to clean myself up before lunch ended.
 The rest of the day went in starts and stutters.
 I went from answering a question about the economy of post-Civil War Georgia, to watching Alec start putting together rough plans for our next group project.
 I had just enough time to notice he seemed relieved I wasn't trying to get in his way, and then Spanish was finishing up and I was headed to the tutoring lab.
 Most Friday afternoon sessions were pretty sparsely attended.
 Today was no different, which was a good thing since I probably wouldn't have done a very good job of explaining anything.

But, with few exceptions, they were founded on the same general principles and on the policy recommendations of Western proponents of rapid transformation to total free-market liberal capitalism, based on a simultaneous shock strategy encompassing macro-economic stabilization, prices and property rights.
 Western governments and the international financial institutions, led by the IMF, strongly advocated this approach and linked financial assistance to its adoption.
 The strategy called for rapid deregulation of prices, privatization of farms and industry, introduction of a convertible currency, and balancing the budget to reduce the high fiscal deficits, primarily by reducing military expenditure and subsidies to producers and consumers.
 The assumption was that a programme with these elements would result in a significant increase in production, efficiency and the availability of consumer goods within a short time.
 The actual results were quite contrary to the expectations of these countries’ Western economic advisers, as well as to the governments and people of the region.
 The initial phase of reforms had a disastrous impact on the economies, on the people and in some countries on peace and political stability.
 From 1990 to 1993 production in all 25 nations declined drastically, from a minimum of 10 per cent in Poland, 20 percent in Hungary and 22 per cent in the Czech Republic to a maximum of 45 per cent in Russia, 57 per cent in Latvia and 75 per cent in Armenia.
 Investment fell by an average rate of 13 –14 per cent per year from 1990 to 1992, and by a three-year total of more than 50 per cent in Russia.
 The fall in real incomes followed that of output, and the impact was made even more severe, especially for pensioners, by the simultaneous dismantling of the vast social support system and dramatic increase in the cost of essential consumer goods.
 The drastic decline in living standards for the vast majority has been accompanied by the emergence of a new class of instantaneous millionaires, some on the basis of their ability in combining factors of production in new circumstances and others due to hoarding of goods under inflation, loopholes in newly enacted legislation on privatization, and personal influence with those in power.

This is the ultimate justification for the insistence of the international lending community on harsh measures to stabilize the economy.
 If the previous stabilization programmes have not proved politically viable, socially acceptable or economically effective, alternative programmes similar to the Yugoslav strategy must be attempted without further delay, backed by the full commitment of government.
 In some cases, it may be necessary to temporarily reintroduce controls on wages and prices as an interim measure to stop the free fall of the currency.
 But whatever the method, it is essential that this effort be combined with simultaneous implementation of other essential policies.
 3.Eliminate crop losses: In Russia and the other republics of the former USSR, highest priority in agriculture must be given to efforts that will increase the availability of food and reduce the huge crop losses and massive food imports.
 These losses vary by crop and region but average between 25 and 50 per cent of total field production for major crops.
 A reduction in crop losses could completely eliminate millions of tons of grain imports.
 The reasons for such enormous losses include poor quality of seeds and planting material, the lack of sufficient local storage capacity, in efficient and inappropriate equipment for planting, harvesting, storage and processing, poorly motivated farm workers and short age of labour at harvest time.
 Demonstration projects have proved that potato losses can be reduced from 35 per cent to under 5 per cent in one year.
 A viable solution requires concerted and coordinated activity by government, industry and agriculture at a time when each is operating in isolation from the others.

Somehow it did matter though.
 To have his friendship dangled out in front of me only to be yanked away a heartbeat later was somehow crueler than I'd ever guessed it would be.
 It all fit together though.
 Jasmin had told him I'd overheard her death threats, and he'd decided to use his good looks to convince me to keep quiet.
 Only he hadn't been able to keep the act up for more than just a few seconds.
 I must really repulse him.
 Physics was my own little personal hell for the next forty minutes.
 I absorbed absolutely nothing from the rest of the discussion about calculating mechanical advantage, and when we were finally released into our groups Alec and I didn't even look each other in the eyes.
 I gutted out the last five minutes by pretending I was completely absorbed in a reference book while Alec started running preliminary calculations.
 He was out of his seat and halfway to the door by the time I'd even realized the bell had rung to dismiss us.

Elves and humans held little love for the orcish kind and had ever since their creation.
 That distaste suited Harruq just fine.
 Deep down, Harruq felt he deserved their ire.
 He stopped by Maggie’s Place, not bothering to go inside.
 It was early morning and anyone already drinking would hardly be useful.
 Instead, he stopped the first random passerby that appeared to be a kindly person.
 “Do you know of a woman named Aurelia?” he asked, butchering the pronunciation.
 The passerby, an elderly woman, sneered at him.
 “Have fun finding that forest slut,” she said before walking on.
 Harruq shrugged, deciding his ability to pick kindly people wasn’t very impressive.

I shouldn't have been surprised by the question, but I was.
 Possibly because I'd spent too much time around people like Britney who were so caught up in their own lives that they didn't really care about what was happening in mine.
 "Les Misérables.
 The music from the musical is so inspiring that I know the book must be truly wonderful."
 I let the statement hang in the air for a couple of seconds, and then finished up with the truth.
 "Of course I don't really know, because it's so big, and parts of it are so boring, that I may never manage to get through the whole thing."
 Chapter 10 The rest of the afternoon finished up on a quiet note.
 After I went back to my table, Rachel worked on some homework for a few more minutes, and then gathered up her things and slipped out.
 I decided the new guy wasn't a football player when he started gathering up his books.
 No athlete in my experience ever took that many books anywhere.

Blood ran from a busted lip.
 The skin on his cheek was already blackening.
 “I don’t know what just happened,” she said, the quiver in her voice belying her calm speech.
 “But I know I don’t like it and will not accept it.
 Ever.
 Is that clear?”
 “Yeah,” Harruq said.
 “Now will you let me down?”
 For a moment, she said nothing, catching her breath and doing her best to calm the flood of adrenaline that still rushed through her.
 Harruq twisted against the vines, but they still held firm.

Art – How so?
 Jim – Maybe on the way home today we’ll get into a terrible flaming car wreck and get ourselves rather dead.
 Art – How is that lucky?
 Jim – It’s not, but it defiantly beats going home and telling Johnny that Gene is soon to be a member of the family.
 And then spending the rest of whenever with Johnny…
 Art – I vote car accident, but we need something that wouldn’t hurt anyone else.
 Are there any cliffs between here and home?
 Preferably one with several hundred feet between it and the ground beneath.
 Jagged rocks would be good as well.
 Make it a quick painless death.

Her family had all received the calling “to serve elfkind.” I didn’t know exactly what that meant, only that the elf usually left with fanfare and seldom returned in fewer than a hundred years.
 It was apparently a very honorable thing, though she never seemed proud.
 Just off the living area was the study, larger than the front room, stuffed full of documents and lit by a pair of dim oil lanterns.
 Dust covered the decrepit scrolls and books lining the walls, but aside from a well-used worktable, the room was clean.
 Settling onto my usual stool, I leaned forward, elbows on the carved edge of the table to prop my head up for the monotonous hours to come.
 It was hard to say how long I sat so, looking down on a huge volume entitled The Great Elves of Varkenshire, pretending to read.
 But my eyes had wandered from the page to a small thistle where it rested among some other potion ingredients.
 It had begun to extend its leaves.
 I was startled; Junnie was preoccupied with a lengthy scroll across the room and couldn’t have possibly been the source, and I had never made anything grow.
 I concentrated on the thistle then, eyeing each tiny spike.

Brandon was inconsolable.
 His best friend was dead.
 Brandon blamed himself for not being there to take care of Tom.
 One of Brandon’s confessions during rehab was that almost all of his friends decided to get as high as they could to attend Tom’s funeral.
 It was the beginning of his excessive drug abuse.
 Chapter 24: Let The Healing Begin As Brandon approached his fifth month as a student at Narconon, he called us and told us he was nearing graduation from the program.
 He also told us he had applied for an internship at the facility and that he wanted to become a drug counselor.
 Brandon told us he wanted to give back and stay on to help others and told us how much better equipped he felt to deal with the world which surrounds us all, but silently haunts a select few.
 The counselors at Narconon had such a profound impact on him that he wanted to have the same impact on others.
 We felt as though we were getting our son back!

High above, the skulls quieted, and their fires dimmed.
 When the necromancer noticed Qurrah’s meddling, his mental link pulsed with incredible energy.
 Colors swarmed through his mind, dark purples and reds across a macabre canvas of black.
 He felt his chest tightening, his neck constricting.
 A scrying eye was upon him, now, and he was losing.
 It felt like an arrow pierced his mind, and through it words seeped into his head.
 _Run.
 Die.
 Collapse.
 Fear.

Quiet, too.
 I imagined he didn’t want me to hear them.
 Paranoia, my mind accused.
 I heard the front door close as I flopped onto the bed, only to jolt upright when Ruby’s door opened a few seconds later.
 It was Chevelle.
 My courage was gone again.
 He seemed to be waiting for me to speak.
 I tried, “I’m sorry I interrupted…” He nodded, but I didn’t know if he was acknowledging my interruption or pardoning it.
 He walked slowly toward the bed, glancing at Ruby’s things on the shelves and walls, and then sat on the bed beside me.
 I forced myself to continue breathing and kept my gaze down, knowing a flush was coming.

“So,” she said casually, “What are you guys talking loudly about?” “Uh...” was all my brain could compute.
 Luckily Seth saved me.
 “What's wrong with two crazy, half-ling kids going outside in the morning because they're both tired of listening to their other two friends bicker while they play hand games?” “Well, you know it's weird that you two are talking alone, without letting the rest of us know what it is,” she shot back.
 “Unless you two are hiding something from us?” Nice save, Seth.
 “Um...” I said.
 “Why would we hide anything from you two?” Emily put her hands on her hips.
 “I don't know, but you two are acting like you are hiding something.” She stopped and gave me a wicked smile.
 “Unless you two were not talking-” “God no, Emily!” I interrupted her.
 “No way, we were just trying to get away from you two because I just woke up and you guys are really loud first thing in the morning.” She sighed.
 “Fine, don't bite my head off Jazell, I was just asking a question.” Then she turned and disappeared back in the cave.

"Still, I'm sorry.
 You seem much too nice of a person to have had all of that happen to you."
 "Nonsense.
 If I am kind, it's no doubt because of those very experiences that I would've been the most desperate to avoid.
 I think most of the best people are that way exactly because of the things they've endured.
 Individuals like Dominic, Rachel, and Jasmin don't just happen.
 They're the result of a native goodness being tempered and refined by terrible experiences."
 Mallory suddenly doubled over in a fit of coughing that left her white and shaking.
 I jumped to my feet and almost ran for Alec, but she grabbed my hand with more of that fragile strength, and pulled me back down.
 "There isn't anything he can do for me, child, and unless I'm very much mistaken he's more than normally worried right now.

The trees were still graceful strands of light, but the breeze had changed to a harsh thing, one carrying new scents that somehow represented danger.
 Something inside me forced my limbs into motion.
 I was running before the first howl tore through the night.
 I was moving unimaginably fast, jumping fallen trees and bounding over other obstacles which even my improved vision struggled to make out in time for me to avoid them.
 The speed of my passage wrung tears from my eyes, but I didn't dare slow.
 They were back there, four of them moving with speed only slightly less than my own, noses to the ground to follow my scent, save for the moments in which they let loose their unearthly howls.
 A flicker of motion up ahead should have made me pull up in fear, but the smell accompanying it was somehow familiar, somehow safe.
 I knew if I could reach the shadowy person I'd been unconsciously following, I'd be safe, but he was so incredibly fast and my pursuers were gaining.
 ** The sound of my alarm pulled me out of a whole series of nightmares in which I was running from unknown menaces.
 Each had been terrifying, but none as vivid as the first.

When Rodregas looked into their eyes he had seen a greater understanding than that possessed by mere animals.
 When they growled, it felt like the earth trembled.
 When Rodregas had seen the Dire Cats in their cage he had not been able to imagine a more powerful lion.
 The Celestial Lion was simply breathtaking; almost twice as large as the Dire Cats and even more powerfully built.
 It was not simply size that set him apart however.
 It was a way of moving, a grace that spoke of perfection.
 To look at a Celestial Beast made Rodregas wish he could write poetry like some noble in one of the high western courts; it made him struggle for words that he simply did not have.
 And what did this marvelous beast do?
 Rutted, gorged, and fell asleep ready for the slaughter.
 Rodregas could not help but shake his head at how life can show you miracles that made you want to live again, and that using the same miracle drives home the fact that there is truly no justice to existence.

 He looked up when she didn't finish.
 "But what?"
 "I-I need a place to stay until I get back."
 He smiled.
 "I think I can stand having you around for a while."
 "I don't want to be a burden .

The sheer shock at still being alive prevented my mind from working very well.
 It took several minutes before all of the other relatively inconsequential details started filtering in.
 My hands were bandaged, as was my elbow and right calf.
 My dirty, ripped jeans and shirt had been replaced with clean clothes that were only a little too small.
 That last fact should have alarmed me more than it did.
 Somehow being stripped down by a stranger paled in comparison to a near-death hallucination involving wolves and a monster straight out of a science fiction movie.
 The bedroom was possibly the nicest room I'd ever been in.
 A movie star or millionaire would have had a hard time topping this place for sheer decadence.
 The walls were paneled in some kind of rare, doubtless expensive imported hardwood.
 The bookcases that covered the majority of the wall space seemed to be made out of the same kind of wood, and were filled with more books than I'd seen in the local bookstore the one time I'd convinced Britney to stop by on our way home after school.

 Jim – After you declared yourself, did Gamura appear and challenge you to battle?
 Liz – Good bye Gene.
 Jim – That is going to provide for hours of fun.
 Liz – I think his feelings where hurt.
 Jim – Maybe.
 But I wouldn’t worry about it, Gene bounces back fast.
 Besides, I think that being adopted into our family will outshine the entire Godzilla Incident.

When she looked around uncomfortably, he asked, "Would you rather talk to the salesgirl about it?"
 "No!
 No .

 She couldn't go to the shore without a bathing suit, and she really wanted to go.
 She glanced up at Rick again.
 She'd much rather suffer the embarrassment with him than with a stranger.

"Are you all right?"
 "No."
 He closed his eyes.
 "What would you say if I told you you could go home tomorrow?"
 "I'd jump for joy.
 Why?"
 He squeezed the back of his chair, refusing to look at her.
 "Yesterday morning, after you went up to your room, I sat in the garden thinking about what your life in 1927 was like."
 His arms began to tremble.
 "I suddenly realized, when I looked out into the garden, that it was 1927."

he would have thought that most 22 year olds in the 1920s would be married.
 Especially a girl as beautiful as this one.
 But Tranton was her family name, so she apparently wasn’t.
 Scanning the text on the page opposite the picture, he found a little information about her.
 She’d gotten married at 23—a year after the picture had been taken.
 And she’d died in 1941.
 So young!
 She’d been only 37.
 Wondering what she’d died of, he turned the page and found more information about her.
 "Jefferson Tranton handpicked Davis Runyon, heir to the Runyon publishing empire, as a husband for his daughter.

The guard captain unrolled the edict, his gut sinking as he realized where he stood.
 Long ago, man and elf had agreed to live together in peace.
 Now, on that very same spot, he would rescind that agreement.
 Beyond the clearing loomed several palisades.
 All nearby windows were closed, and several boarded.
 A few humans stuck their heads out their doors to glimpse the armored men trampling through their city.
 Most kept themselves far from danger.
 “Elves and men of the city of Woodhaven,” Antonil shouted.
 “By order of the noble and sovereign King of Neldar, all elven kind has been banned from human lands.
 The elves of Woodhaven have ignored this edict, ignored the laws of the great kingdom in which they live.

And I knew him, man.
 Knew him as teacher/mentor/friend.
 It was as if I’d been sanctified.
 Another father.
 He taught me “Don’t Let the Sun Pull Your Pants Down,” “Piggly Wiggly Blues,” “She Caught the Katy,” “Her Ass Moves I Moan.”  Underground stuff, stuff from the adult’s table, from the back room.
 And I lapped it up.
 And Tennessee paid me the high compliment, man.
 He told me nobody played like me except Riley.

The sensible, grownup part of me was arguing for another five minutes just to make sure, but I told that part to take a flying leap and all but ran through the house looking for Donovan.
 "Yes, mistress?
 Do you need something?"
 "Donovan, Alec said I could go watch them work out.
 Will you take me to wherever they are?"
 He dried his hands on a blisteringly white towel, and nodded.
 "Of course.
 I believe they are in the north end of the valley.
 Right this way."
 We made good time, even with Donovan's jerky, oftentimes painful gait, but the estate was even bigger than I'd realized.

I slipped into Spanish exactly three seconds before the late bell sounded, but Mrs. Tiggs wasn't even there.
 When she finally did show up, we had a surprise quiz on our vocabulary.
 Once we finished she turned on the television and told us to listen for conjugation.
 I almost wished I shared the class with Britney, her dad seemed like the type to get six kinds of riled up over something like that.
 He'd probably go straight to the school board and demand a new Spanish teacher altogether.
 It was a real relief when I was finally able to leave the drab little classroom.
 I stopped off at my locker before heading to the tutor room, but Britney was nowhere to be seen.
 Probably still mad.
 I mentally shrugged as I swapped out books, and set off.
 Rachel was already seated in her usual spot in no-man's-land.

From preoccupation with problems and limitations to an appreciation of the opportunities for more rapid development.
 From wanting to meet people’s minimum needs to wanting to help them realize their maximum potentials.
 From the attitude that everything is determined by external constraints – money, other nations, political leaders, the general public – to the attitude that everything is determined by our inner resource fulness and that there are no limits to what it can accomplish.
 From viewing the developing world as a problem or a burden to viewing it as a vast untapped potential for global progress.
 From feeling that those who cannot find jobs must be paid social welfare to the attitude that everyone must be offered opportunities for gainful employment.
 Cultural Values and Development
 The growing violence, more and more visible disparities between rich and poor, and large-scale destruction of the environment cited in this report have raised widespread concern that the present course of development is undermining the cultural as well as the natural environment for human development.
 A careful analysis of the relationship between culture and development reveals that cultural values are the essential foundation for all lasting social achievement.
 The security, stability, productivity, growth and sustainability of society are determined by its values.
 This report calls upon nations and the international community to make a conscious shift to values that can generate greater domestic and international security, higher rates of sustainable growth, and more equitable distribution of benefits for all.

It felt odd having so little hair on his head.
 Aurelia sat down on her legs, her hands folded upon her dress.
 “Harruq, have you killed before?” she asked.
 The half-orc opened his mouth and then closed it.
 A boy’s face flashed before his eyes.
 _You’re an orc, aren’t you?_
 “Yes,” he said at last.
 “I’ve killed.”
 He eyed Aurelia, desperately wishing to know what she thought yet unable to figure out why he even cared.
 He thought he saw pity in her eyes, perhaps compassion.

My family is of the Orrghirrlida tribe that follows the Celestials.
 Of course, the Daemon Lords love to tempt all those of Celestial blood.
 I was born a bastard from an illicit affair of such a temptation.
 While the shape my father had taken had been fair, I came out, well let’s just say my paternity was not in question.” “This is an old game among my people,” Doi’van continued “and while I suffered much in my own clan, they kept me in the palace and I grew to adulthood in its strong magical confines and to my full strength.” “So,” Imeralda broke in, “You are of both Infernal and Celestial blood?” Doi’van seemed hesitant to answer for a moment but after a long pause said, “Yes, but most choose not to see it that way.
 You are either Hellborn or not.
 After I grew to manhood, I decided my true place was among one of the other clans, one that follows the lordship of the Hellborn.” He spoke this very slowly each deep rumble of his tone dragged out.
 “I was wrong though, and quickly realized that those who follow the Lords of the Infernal Realms were even a worse fit for me than at home, though they did see me as royal blood and not tainted.” Doi’van added, “I eventually decided to start somewhere new and took a ship across the inland sea.” Doi’van paused at this and shook his head, his hair flying wild, as he seemed to want to shake out a memory from his massive head before he continued.
 “I am afraid I did not ask enough questions.
 I just wanted to get a fresh start.
 I was in Guild Dealer Taigas’ Menagerie to be sold within a week of my arrival.” He finished, his smile fading at the memory.

I wasn't sure I was any more ready than I'd been out in the parking lot, but I could tell by the way he was moving that he wasn't going to abort this time.
 The tingling was even more intense now as I brought my hand up and cupped the side of his face, and then our lips met.
 It wasn't like I'd imagined.
 His lips were warm, and they had the slightest hint of softness, but there was more urgency and fierceness to the kiss than expected.
 It wasn't as amazing as I'd fantasized, but I was still having a hard time thinking.
 I tried to pull back and catch my breath, but his arms had become steel cables that pulled me in tighter.
 Fear finally overcoming my desire not to look stupid.
 I started to push away from Brandon.
 My efforts seemed futile for several seconds, and then his right arm released me.
 He wasn't letting me go though, his right hand had just repositioned to my stomach while his left arm kept me pinned against him almost as tightly as both hands had just a second before.

Footsteps?
 Who would be out here?
 A neighbor's child, maybe?
 He decided to investigate, although the fog made it difficult.
 To his knowledge, no children had ever come here, but he wanted to be sure that no one was trampling the flowers.
 He almost ran into the girl looking at his fountain.
 "Excuse me.
 The fog is so bad that I almost didn't see you."
 She was so glad to see somebody.
 "I seem to be lost.

I was still trying to sort out all the pieces when Brandon fished his cell phone out of a pocket and checked the time.
 In an amazing display of herd behavior, thirty seconds later his friends had all disappeared, and he was standing to leave.
 "We should do this more often.
 I'll see you tomorrow."
 The words were innocent enough, but there was something in his eyes that made a rush of warmth shoot through me.
 Britney was so excited she could hardly speak, but I was too excited myself to feel very superior.
 I floated through my next class, and would've gone through the rest of the day the same way, if I hadn't had to share a class with Alec.
 Still, I was so happy that even Alec's giving me the cold shoulder didn't completely sour my day.
 Rachel had turned my illness into something really cool, and Brandon really did like me.
 Life couldn't get much better than this.

Still, only the fact that Alec's pack closed ranks around me kept the situation from becoming unbearable.
 Biology went better than it had since my first day in Sanctuary, largely because Alec seemed to have developed a postdoctorate knowledge of Biology.
 Also he didn't have a single qualm when it came to using that knowledge to deflect questions aimed at me.
 Mrs. Sorenson tried three different times to make me look stupid before finally giving up and getting down to the business of teaching.
 She continued to shoot us nasty looks throughout the class, but I hardly noticed.
 Alec spent the rest of the class time writing questions for me in the margins of my notebook.
 By the time I'd described my grandparents, kindergarten teacher, and top three most embarrassing moments, I wanted to get a chance to ask some questions of my own, but he just shook his head and passed me my notebook back with a new set of quickly-jotted queries.
 The sentences should have been a careless mess based on the speed with which he was writing.
 Instead they turned out more even and carefully constructed than anything I'd ever been able to accomplish.
 I'm the Alpha here; you can ask your questions when I finish with mine.

He had been living on less since he was on lock-down and that was lowering the level in the tests, but he was really never without Oxy.
 It was late 2008 and my business was suffering the effects of the economic meltdown.
 Just a couple of years before that my business income had been five times what it was then.
 Bryce, in college, was working three jobs to pay his own expenses, something we could no longer afford to help with.
 Simply put, we were falling behind on everything and we didn’t have the money to put Brandon in a rehab; so we began searching the internet for someplace that would take him without an exorbitant amount of cash.
 The State run agencies were crammed with voluntary admissions and court ordered treatment.
 Brandon’s girlfriend, Tiffanie had already been in a thirty-day rehab twice before.
 We had heard plenty of horror stories from her about her stint in the county rehab: Apparently, several people had over-dosed on drugs while in the facility, one had died, and she had relapsed and used Oxy while she was in there.
 The problem with a facility that accepts court ordered patients is that the patient doesn’t want to be there.
 They are basically given the option of jail or rehab and they make the clear choice.

“This is no healing potion,” Dieredon said.
 He threw the vial.

 Velixar snarled as holy light of the elven goddess burned his decaying flesh.
 After a few seconds, the light vanished.
 Velixar glanced about, seeing no sign of the elf.
 “No matter,” he said.
 “Come my minions.
 It is time to hunt.”
 He spread his hands wide and let all of his power flow freely.

Thomas and I stuck together, were confidants and support for one another.
 We were getting older and wiser so we were more aware of what was going on around us.
 Our stepfather Dino turned out to be a mystery man with a past that didn’t add up and a temper that escalated with every drink he poured down his throat.
 He had a painted on smile that couldn’t be trusted.
 It was the same smile every time and it was anything but genuine and it could turn to angry gritted teeth in a moment.
 He was terrifyingly loud and strong, and we were not accustomed to being told what to do by a man.
 We did our best to stay out of his way, particularly when he was drinking, but he would always find us.
 My brother Thomas and I had become very good at yard work and chores as we learned to perform them with perfection or pay the price of Dino’s disappointment.
 Every weekend was filled with hours upon hours of yard work at Dino’s command.
 If we ran out of work to do, Dino would have us move a scrap woodpile from one end of the backyard to another, then back again if he wasn’t done with us.

My jacket saved me from picking up any really serious scrapes this time, but just before I finished tumbling to a stop I slammed my head into a crescent-shaped rock.
 My vision swam in and out of focus, but I struggled to my feet, only to nearly fall again as my right ankle all but collapsed under me.
 They were definitely closer now.
 They'd stopped howling, but I could still hear them.
 I somehow found myself on my back again, looking up at the biggest wolf I'd ever seen.
 TV had given me the impression that a wolf shouldn't be much bigger than a German Shepherd.
 These guys were roughly the size of a small pony, one nearly black, the other more of a gray color, both with yellowish eyes, and lips pulled back to show teeth the size of my fingers.
 Most of my jeans had been torn away from my right calf, which was bleeding fairly profusely, but I didn't feel any pain.
 It was like my mind had finally torn loose from the moorings that usually held it in contact with reality.
 I was going to die, ripped to shreds by the same impossible animals that had killed the hikers a few months ago, but I just couldn't bring myself to care.

In a command economy, a few people at the top receive most of the information and take most of the decisions, while the rest of the population carries them out.
 In contrast, the market is based on millions of decisions taken every day by millions of individuals in fields, factories and retail stores around the country.
 All these decision makers require timely access to re liable sources of information.
 Information is needed to make sound business decisions, such as the production of or demand for different commodities or variations in price by region or over time.
 Easy access, maximum dissemination, full disclosure, precise accuracy and credibility are imperative.
 Creating these conditions will require the establishment of new institutions and substantial investment in infra structure.
 In many of these countries, the press has freed itself from being solely an instrument of government, but television is still largely under state control.
 In the entire former USSR today there is no adequate agricultural extension service to transmit research findings from the laboratory to the field, especially to small private farmers.
 Poor communications systems are incapable of handling the large volume of telephone, fax, telex and computerized messages needed for commercial linkages with other countries.
 10.Catalytic initiatives can release social dynamism: Social change is facilitated and accelerated by initiatives to introduce or demonstrate new patterns of activity and behaviour appropriate to the goals of the transition.

Then he added, “I am afraid my people are not big readers, and, well, they saw me as half-monster and I never learned how to read.” The last words he added very slowly, but then quickly added, “But if you can teach me some basics from the oral techniques that Imeralda mentioned, I would like to learn some magic if I can.” Rodregas looked at Doi’van; there was something about his expression, a yearning.
 “Do you want to learn to read?” he asked.
 “What do you mean?” Doi’van asked, stepping away from the other two like he was uncomfortable.
 “Just what I said, would you like to learn to read?” Rodregas said in a carefully casual voice.
 Doi’van responded, “We don’t have time for me to learn to read.
 You should spend time practicing with these Grimoires.
 It makes no sense to teach me to read when we are likely to see battle too soon for it to be helpful.” Doi’van’s voice, which was always deep, seemed to have gone down several octaves, such that the earth almost seemed to vibrate.
 Somehow, while the conversation on magic Grimoires had been of interest to him, the idea of learning to read seemed to terrify him.
 Rodregas knew the feeling of wanting something so much that you are afraid to accept it when offered, for fear of failing.
 “Well,” Rodregas said, “I think it might come in handy to have you able to read.

Hearing that Brandon was taking you was harder for me to accept than you might imagine.
 My asking you now has nothing to do with our conversation from earlier today."
 "Why are you doing it now then?
 I half expected you to try and send me out of the country again.
 An invitation to the local equivalent to Prom was the last thing on my mind."
 The pair of ants disappeared, hidden among the lush grass that somehow managed not to look out of place here on the edges of the desert.
 I was starting to realize that the best way to get information out of a guy was to wait him out.
 Sometimes applying a little judicious pressure here or there helped, but it was largely just a matter of letting them work through whatever internal barriers stopped them from sharing their feelings.

 It represents so much of what I want, but is wrong for you on almost every level.

I was spellbound, pixilated.
 It was a ramshackle, poor man’s Kubla Kahn.
 I walked slowly around her little apartment, which was like some chthonic art gallery, lit by phosphorous.
 She had art reproductions by Klee, Gironella, Motherwell, Picabia, Bacon, this weird Malcolm Morley yellow pages thing, Ensor, on and on.
 Twombly.
 There was a mandala on the ceiling, a pentangle on the floor, what you could see, through the album covers and splayed paperbacks and drawings.
 It was strange stuff to me, eye-opening, shocking in a way.
 That shock that comes from knowing something is important but not knowing exactly why.
 And she had in between all these great prints, torn newspapers, headlines juxtaposed against this great art, you know?
 And her own drawings, little line drawings of dwarves and headless figures and skulls and djinns.

Jim – First of all those were perhaps the most ironic statements I’ve ever heard.
 It must be one of those instances of “takes one to know one.”  Secondly, I don’t know.
 I’m as confused as anyone as to why I’ve attracted Liz’s attention and kept it for all these years.
 But now that I know, I’m not going to complain.
 I’m just embarrassed that I never saw it before.
 Johnny – Is that all you’re embarrassed about?
 Jim – What do you mean?
 Johnny – Well you work as a Janitor, at least when you’re at school.
 You have a job where you wear your name on your shirt.
 Eugene – You don’t do all that well when you’re at school, and it’s not like you’re going to some high class college, you’re at a low end public university.

Binding the pouch as I had found it, I tucked it into the pack.
 When I checked my hands to decipher the lines, I realized I was seeing a map.
 Yes, it was burned into my palms, but it was a map.
 I couldn’t fathom why anyone would have a ridiculous spell like that, and then it struck me that it had come from the vault, from my own family’s things.
 I bit down hard on my lip, fighting the impulsive urge that always got me into trouble.
 But I didn’t want to go back to the village, not ever.
 And I only had this one chance, this small moment before they came to retrieve me.
 I grabbed the dress off the tree branch—the last evidence of me being here—and threw it into the pack.
 Swinging it around onto my back, I started to run.
 I didn’t know where I was or where the map would take me, but I finally had a purpose.

But Ruby had just told me her own story, no less tragic.
 She mistook my reaction.
 “Oh, don’t be silly.
 I wouldn’t play the same design twice.” I relaxed, but only a little.
 “Besides, I will let you in on a little secret… the fairy’s breath isn’t really breath.
 Can you imagine if it were?
 Why, everywhere we go we’d cause a terrible ruckus.
 It’s a blend, is all.
 We keep it in a tiny capsule in our cheek and when we need it…” She chomped her teeth together with a click, the look surprisingly feral.
 And then she smiled, her face melting back into something very near adorable as she held a finger to her lips, protecting the secret.

“The problem is… meddling with the bindings, meddling with your mind is… well, it’s dangerous.” And there it was.
 “Dangerous,” I repeated.
 They let me consider that for a moment.
 They were being careful with me, didn’t want to upset me.
 I tried to ease them.
 “So we go back to the village and…” They shared an uncomfortable glance, and then, “Not High Council, Freya.
 Grand Council.” Oh, right.
 The ones who were trying to capture me.
 The ones who want to burn me.
 Their cautious demeanor made more sense now.

They utilized import tariffs, export incentives, tax relief and other mechanisms to guide development of their domestic economies.
 The reform programme involved the dismantling of most of the administrative mechanisms by which an economy can be monitored and controlled by government.
 In place of free market conditions, organized crime and corruption became rampant.
 In seeking to reject thoroughly the authoritarian form of government that suppressed the rights of the people, many of these countries allowed the power and authority of their central governments to de cline to the point where they could no longer enforce conditions needed for operation of either a command economy or a free market system.
 The power of government in the West may be veiled by the fact that its laws are usually obeyed without the need for exercise of force, but the threat of enforcement is as real for tax evaders in North America as it was for free marketers under the communist regime in USSR.
 Regardless of the system, strong government is a prerequisite for a strong economy.
 The experience of the past few years has clearly demonstrated that the state must play a very active role in order to bring about a smooth and rapid transition and this role cannot be limited purely to regulation of the market.
 Intervention will also be necessary in the form of central planning and industrial policy, at least during the transition period.
 The radical restructuring of entire industries – defence, agriculture, aluminium, steel – is too complex and massive an undertaking to be made the responsibility of market forces and individual firms.
 7.Agriculture has to be given a special status: For reasons discussed in the previous chapter, the state has an especially important role in the regulation of agriculture.

That was when I heard the chanting.
 My ears had been roaring with anger, but all that was left was a soft recitation.
 “Gian Zet Foria.
 Gian Zet Foria.
 Gian Zet Foria.” Junnie.
 Junnie was chanting something.
 I was engulfed with an empty, lethargic feeling.
 My eyes batted open and I was lying on the ground, looking up at Junnie and Chevelle.
 Junnie’s words ran together as Chevelle mumbled.
 “Gian Zet Foria Gian Zet Foria Gian Zet Foria.” It seemed so familiar.

He didn't believe in extraterrestrials, he didn't believe in ghosts, and he certainly didn't believe that people could travel through time.
 But here she was.
 His mind reeled with the implications and unreality of it all.
 And the emotion that permeated his jumbled thoughts was guilt.
 He'd been preoccupied with thoughts of Marie ever since he'd seen her picture.
 Was it possible that his thoughts had somehow brought her here?
 But even if that were true, how could he have known that thinking about someone would cause her to appear?
 He'd loved studying history in school, and Abraham Lincoln had never appeared.
 He scowled at the chicken as he took it from the oven.
 How was he going to help her get back?

Instead, the elf was left gasping as he retreated from another series of strikes from Harruq.
 “Pretenders, are we?” Qurrah asked as his fingers performed a dark weave.
 “How much I wish for your pride to suffer.” Magical energy rippled out of him and tore across the air.
 The elf whirled, sensing the incoming invisible blow.
 Only a tiny part hit his shoulder, immediately encasing it in ice.
 Then Harruq was upon him, slashing recklessly.
 Ahrqur batted his sword left and right, then jumped as Harruq swung back in a scissor-cut that should have shredded his waist.
 The elf landed atop one of his couches, balancing with ease.
 “What reason do you have to kill me?” the elf asked.
 “Are you here for money?

My raised eyebrow was completely involuntary, and apparently more eloquent than I'd realized.
 At least it earned me another laugh.
 "It wasn't like it was easy or anything, but Donovan gave me some good advice when things were the worst.
 I don't remember his exact words, but essentially it came down to the fact that there'll always be people who're better than me at something.
 Even gaining super powers wouldn't change that.
 What's important is that I do the best I can with what I've been given.
 As crazy as it sounds, Alec's pack needs me."
 I mentally reached around for something similar and then finally nodded.
 "I guess I can understand that.
 My mom would have a hard time functioning without me, so I try to do the best I can at taking care of her."

Rodregas met Doi’van’s smile with a smile of his own.
 He reached out and grabbed Doi’van’s forearm and gripped it in the handshake of warriors and said, “You have spoken to me honestly.
 I will honor that with my own honesty.
 I don’t know exactly how I ended up in this body, but I do know that I killed Ravenhurr, and I killed his bastard assistant, Korin.
 The Immortalists are a sore on the world.
 Their use of others’ bodies and power and their very way of life is abhorrent.” Rodregas looked Doi’van in the eyes and said, “The name I was born with is Rodregas.
 When I decided to kill Ravenhurr, I promised the gods that if they let me survive, I would take on the duty of killing the Immortalists.
 It is a duty that I know will end in my death.
 There are hundreds of Immortalists.
 Some almost as powerful as gods, but it is a good death and one I have chosen.” Rodregas paused and looked at Doi’van’s features.

"I think you meant to ask what I am."
 Alec sighed, but it wasn't an angry sigh, so I nodded, forgetting for a moment that he couldn't see me in the darkness.
 "We share a little in common with a bunch of different legends, but none get it quite right.
 In short, we're shape shifters, people who can take the form of animals."
 I'd already seen that for myself, but it was strangely exhilarating to hear him admit it.
 "You mean like werewolves?"
 There was a hiss of sound, as if I'd just hit him.
 For a second I worried I'd made him angry.
 "No, not like werewolves."
 I waited for him to elaborate.

Since second grade.
 All through elementary school, she was always the smartest in class, and kinder than anybody else I knew.
 She spent eighth grade in my mom's English and Social Studies class.
 Later my mom called her the brightest student she ever taught.
 And her pure and soulful singing would land her, only months after high school, on a weekly television show with a folk group, The Good Time Singers.
 That summer before our senior year, Margaret's best friend was Pam Greenman, who attended our rival high school.
 Lane was someone I probably never would've befriended if not for Eric.
 Since we met in seventh grade, I had considered Lane a smart-mouthed little pest while he thought of me as a big, dumb oaf.
 In Eric's company, we each learned better.
 I have Eric's treasures, which Sylvia gave me.

"I'm glad I'm the first."
 He glanced at her left hand.
 She'd taken off her engagement ring yesterday before they'd left for the shore, and she hadn't put it back on last night.
 She wasn't wearing it this morning, either.
 He wondered if she realized it but decided not to ask her.
 Setting his cup down, he said, "How would you like another new experience?"
 She smiled in delight.
 "What?"
 "Washing my car."
 Her face fell.

I didn't really want to know anyway."
 Brandon chuckled as he threw the Mustang into reverse and sped out of the lane faster than normal.
 The stereo clicked over to another song as we flipped around and headed back into town.
 It was more of the thrumming beats I'd come to associate with Brandon.
 "I thought this place was in one of the parks or something.
 Why are we headed back to town?"
 "Wow, you really are a city girl.
 In order to get far enough not to be busted by the cops we have to go really remote.
 There isn't any way my car would make it where we need to go.
 We're headed to Vincent's to hitch a ride in his truck."

 Pleased, she returned to the dressing room, feeling better about the bathing suit.

The corporations could also acquire the rights to important technologies with large-scale applications and then market them widely.
 Velocity of social forces
 Speed is a powerful engine for development and an important index of organizational efficiency and effectiveness.
 The higher the level of organization and development, the faster everything moves.
 The more developed the society, the faster it communicates new ideas and new information, develops new technologies and products, establishes new systems and institutions, adopts new policies and laws, transports goods, delivers services and carries out activities.
 Money, information, education, technology, public opinion, training, administrative decisions, transport, and communication are powerful social forces and resources.
 Their productivity can be increased by increasing the speed with which they are employed, in the same way that land productivity can be raised by increasing cultivation from one to two cropping seasons per year.
 In the most industrially advanced nations, the velocity of money is roughly 2.5 to 3 times higher than in the average developing country.
 Removing administrative red tape and inefficiencies in the banking system can multiply the use value and productivity of real money, because the same money can be utilized for more transactions.
 The same is true for information, technology, training, transport and other factors.

“Well…” Again he stopped, obviously uneasy about what he wanted to say.
 “It was still dead, but it was moving now.
 That make sense?
 Qurrah could make it do whatever he wanted.
 He let it run off and die, that first one he showed me.
 He was pretty shy about it.
 Don’t think he had any idea how I would react.”
 Harruq suddenly stopped and laughed.
 “You should have seen us, Aurelia.
 We spent the rest of the day chasing after mice so we could stomp them and have Qurrah bring them back to do tricks.”

I glanced at the nearby woods.
 My ears heard nothing and I didn’t see any movement but my hands shook slightly as I typed, Nothing, I’m fine.
 I didn’t open his reply because I knew what it would say.
 I already knew that it was strangely quiet.
 Maybe I could stay home and sleep one night.
 Or maybe I could finish a painting tonight and watch Mom do origami.
 I turned the corner, and my house came into view.
 I started to climb the hill when I froze.
 Out of my left eye I saw the outline of a creature.
 It was heading through the woods in the direction of my house.

"Sorry, that's touching on some of the things I'm not supposed to tell you."
 I shrugged, pretending indifference.
 "How soon will we know if it's really bad or just a little bad?"
 "I don't know.
 Things were already pretty tense.
 That's probably where Alec is right now actually.
 Brandon's people are always skirting around the edge of our territory, but tonight they'll be out in greater numbers than normal.
 If things don't boil over now, it's pretty much guaranteed that there will be some kind of confrontation Monday at school."
 The word confrontation reached out and grabbed me.
 It took a second before I realized it was dragging up memories of the near-fight between Alec and half his pack.

Rapid and sustained expansion of food and agricultural production cannot be achieved without concerted efforts to address these factors.
 At the same time there are a number of positive factors that offer opportunities to increase productivity significantly in the near to middle term.
 Closing the productivity gap
 A survey comparing the levels of productivity for major crops between countries reveals a wide disparity between proven technological potentials and actual field results for every crop.
 Cereal yields in Western Europe and North America average 4.5 tons per hectare, compared to three tons in Asia, 2.3 tons in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, two tons in Latin America and slightly more than one ton in Africa.
 The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) projects a 40 per cent increase in wheat yields in 92 developing countries, excluding China, by 2010.
 In rice, countries with widely differing climatic conditions, such as Australia, Korea, Egypt, Spain, Japan and Italy, achieve average yields nearly double the world average and two to three times the yields achieved in countries such as India, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand.
 Total rice yields in 92 developing countries are expected to rise to 37 per cent by 2010.
 Maize yields in Greece, Chile, Austria, Italy and Germany average more than double the world average, and five to six times the averages achieved in large maize-producing countries such as India.
 Even comparing areas under irrigated maize, average yields range from 1.5 to 8.4 tons per hectare.

But, we have invariably seen that if the participation in the market place is not accompanied by political participation, development efforts are brought to naught by social and political instability.... Once again, therefore, we see the inescapable relations governing the goals of peace, development and democratization – these are the goals of the United Nations.
 In order for this revolution to have its full beneficial impact on the world’s political and economic affairs, its principles need to be extended to cover all nations and international institutions.
 The end of the confrontation between democratic and autocratic superpowers within the UN system opens up the possibility of finally translating the idealistic aims of the UN into practical realities.
 First and foremost is the prospect of extending representative government to all nations.
 This effort will be given strong impetus by establishing democracy as a minimum condition for membership and participation of states in the affairs of the UN.
 It is true that the UN stands for diversity and pluralism, but not when it comes to freedom and human rights.
 True pluralism and diversity can only be exercised and enjoyed by people in freedom.
 Recognizing the considerable effort that will be needed to prepare still subject people and to train national leaders in democratic institutions and processes, all possible support should be extended by the international community to make available the knowledge and skills needed to build viable political institutions.
 The UN should establish a graded, time-bound programme for the transformation of authoritarian states.
 Should the people of any country themselves prefer an alternative system, let them freely make that choice by electoral process.

After tossing and turning for hours, she got up and took a long bath.
 By the time she'd dressed, it was dawn.
 She was restless, but she didn't know what she wanted to do.
 Finally she decided to go for a walk in the garden to see if the quiet stroll would help her sort out her thoughts and feelings.
 Davis seemed like a different man since they'd become betrothed.
 He didn't have much time for her, and when they were together, he shouted at her.
 But he always apologized.
 Maybe that was part of being a wife--letting him take out his frustrations on her.
 Marie stepped carefully around an azalea bush.
 It was so foggy this morning that she could barely see three feet ahead.

I have no spells that can aid us.”
 The bigger half-orc stood and stretched his muscles.
 “Well, up to me then.” He took out Condemnation, grinning as the soft red glow lit up his face.
 “Let’s see how strong this girl is.”
 He swung the blade.
 Qurrah closed his eyes and hoped no significant enchantments guarded the fence.
 If any did, they fizzled against the magic of the ancient sword.
 Harruq sliced two of the bars cleanly, and a third dented in enough so that a follow up chop cut it like butter.
 Pleased, Harruq took two of the bars into his hands.
 His neck bulged, his arm muscles tensed, and then the iron screeched backward.

Not necessarily with muscle, some more bulbous.
 The women were varied as well, some thin and wiry, some stout like the males.
 Their hair was in all shades—light blond like the sun, brown as the trees, one even had rusty red, his plump cheeks peppered with light brown spots.
 And there were so many children!
 They were loud and ran round the camp all afternoon.
 And they were just as varied as the adults.
 I examined their wide noses, rounded ears, and stubby fingers.
 Those who wore no shoes had short, thick toes like trolls.
 The men had patches of hair curled on their chests and forearms and some even grew it around their chins like goats.
 Their clothes were tattered and ill-fitting rags.

“No need for lies,” he said.
 The elf laughed a little but said nothing.
 Instead, she walked over and gave Harruq a quick peck on the cheek.
 “Keep your big butt safe, okay?” she said.
 The half-orc tried to answer but his mouth refused to cooperate.
 Somehow, it seemed to have become unhinged.
 Besides, it wasn’t as if he could think of anything to say.
 All his mind could concentrate on was the feel of the elf’s soft lips on his cheek, the flowery scent of her perfume mixed with sweat, and the quick brush of her breasts against his arm.
 By the time his jaw and mind began working again, Aurelia was laughing.
 “What’s so funny?” he demanded.

Governments projected demand, set production targets for specific crops, and instituted programmes to help farmers produce the food needed to meet the minimum needs of the population.
 But once shortages are eliminated, the focus on specific commodities becomes a barrier to further agricultural development, because it retards diversification into more profitable commercial crops.
 Contrary to free market theory, farmers in many countries have tended to continue production of traditional crops, even when prices have fallen in response to increased supplies.
 There is still a need for government to educate and encourage farmers to adopt resource-based planning, oriented to national and international market potentials and based on principles of economics, employment and ecology.
 Resource-based planning examines how the available land and water resources can best be utilized to achieve maximum and sustainable economic return to the farmer, which is only rarely the priority of governments in developing countries that tend to focus on production targets for specific commodities.
 This shift can lead to diversification into commercial crops, such as fruit and vegetables, that generate significant increases in on-farm employment and incomes and act as a stimulus to downstream agro-industries.
 From minimum needs to maximum potentials
 The factors which have perpetuated commodity-based planning in agriculture have also fostered an emphasis on minimum targets, rather than maximum goals.
 Often government has perceived that its responsibility was to ensure sufficient food to prevent famine, not maximum output and profitability.
 Government machinery has proved effective in forcing through radical measures to disseminate new technology, seed and production methods in the face of crisis, but it usually lacks the driving impetus to work for the highest benefit of individual farmers.

CM:  	You were gonna be in Hair?
 BG: 	Well, I don’t know, we were just talking.
 I don’t think he’d quite settled yet, on his approach, the whole tribal thing.
 I mean, it was a student thing, mostly, and he did these intense tribal unity things before he ever started rehearsing the play.
 It was beautiful.
 I was part of some of the early planning.
 Mostly it was just talk.
 I’d sit in, we’d all be in a room and we’d just chant for an hour or so.
 It was ritualistic.
 But, those songs…beautiful stuff.

Seth put his arms in surrender.
 “Hey, don't start yelling at me.
 We were getting a long pretty well last night, let's keep it that way.” I felt my face flush when I remembered last night.
 “Yes, you're right.” I was eager to change the subject so I said, “Are you going to tell them when they wake up?” “Yes I will, Jazell.
 I promised.” I sighed in relief.
 “Good...” I heard a loud yawn and Emily stretched her arms in the air.
 She stood up and walked the couple of feet over to me and stopped.
 I pushed myself up and leaned against the tree.
 Emily gave me a light smile.
 “Good morning!” she said and twirled around.

And if you believed Fannie’s theories, they held secret documents here as well, things they didn’t want commonly known.
 The walls were stark white, like carved marble, and the room felt cold and empty, despite the abundance inside.
 I found a shelf to hide behind and placed my pilfered documents on the floor.
 I examined the shelves in front of me, looking for a match to the symbols, and found the sections to be arranged by groups, each shelf divided by categories within.
 I walked the library in search of the section marked for either of the characters listed on my documents, and was about to give up when I noticed some encased racks in the center of the room.
 I checked the small section, seeing immediately the symbols fit.
 I smiled, thinking how easy it had been as I slid my fingertips across the volumes on that shelf.
 My fingers tingled as they crossed a thin section of pages bound together.
 I slid them out just as I became aware of some sort of commotion… that sounded like it was getting closer.
 No, not a tingle indicating what I was looking for.

Yesterday it had made her long for home.
 Now it made her long for Rick.
 She wanted to wear it for him.
 She certainly wasn't going to wear it for Davis.
 After breakfast Mr. Tranton went to call his daughter’s betrothed.
 Marie was in the living room with her mother and brother, and they jumped when they heard him begin shouting.
 They'd had only enough time to look at each other in bewilderment when Mr. Tranton joined them.
 "Young Runyon will be here within the hour."
 Understanding dawned, and Marie said quietly, "He didn't want to come until after work, did he?"

Mom and 11-year-old Harry were losing everything to the IRS, and it was just a matter of time before they were broke and homeless.
 I went home to help her; after all, I had nowhere else to be.
 Chapter 10: A Vision Appears There is such a thing as love at first sight, and I know because it happened to me.
 Valentine’s Day, 1981, I decided to go to this local pick-up joint with Bill and hang with the rest of the hounds.
 This club, called “The Phone Company,” had phones on every table surrounding a dance floor.
 Each table had a number posted on a short pole that protruded above the phone.
 Pick up the phone at any table, dial the two digit number of the table you wanted to connect with and there you have it: a coward’s way of asking a lady to dance or talk without getting shot down tableside.
 What can I say?
 This was the style at the time.
 I was sitting at the bar with Bill, just a twenty-two year old kid, when a vision walked in.

"A paltry sum if it helps ensure a perfect night for you."
 "You've done so much.
 I mean the dress, the shoes, and now this.
 Thank you, but you really shouldn't have."
 His smile was back, and for some reason it nearly pulled tears out of me.
 "I'm glad you like it.
 The fact that everyone else gets to participate is nice, but really it's all for you.
 Of course I did make a couple of stipulations."
 The music started up before I could ask what he meant.
 Almost before I realized what was going on, I found myself twirling through some kind of modified waltz.

Existing trade barriers by the industrial nations to textile exports cost developing countries an estimated $50 billion annually.
 The complete elimination of these barriers could result in a doubling of textile exports by developing countries.
 This labour-intensive industry can be another engine for job creation in developing countries and rising demand for technology and capital goods from the industrial nations.
 The progressive reduction, leading to the eventual elimination, of barriers to trade in agricultural products and textiles is an important step that can substantially improve the employment opportunities of people in developing countries.
 5.Improve access to markets: The most important structural change in the world economy over the past 35 years has been the five-fold increase in the world share of manu factured exports gained by the developing countries as a group, up from 4 per cent to 19 per cent, compared with a current market share of about 13 per cent each of the United States and for Japan.
 Although 54 per cent of these manufactures come from five top exporting countries, a large number of countries export more than $1 billion in this category annually.
 This has opened the door for self-reliant growth in many developing countries.
 This growth could have been considerably more impressive but for constraints placed on it by both tariff and, particularly, non-tariff barriers.
 The latter have proliferated in recent decades and affected almost half of OECD imports during the 1980s.
 By the end of 1990, there were more than 200 export-constraint arrangements involving product groups of impor tance to developing countries.

“My turn to ask a question,” said Rodregas.
 “How did you connect the three of us to these crimes?” Van’dret shrugged and smiled and said, “To be honest, I did not really think you were the ones.
 I simply did not like you, and the way you hung out with non-Celestials.
 It is unnatural.
 Now, it is my turn to ask a question.” “Actually,” interrupted Rodregas, “you already asked me about being an old soldier.
 Let me answer that first.
 I was a sergeant in Ravenhurr’s guard and I am afraid I have become what I learned to hate more than anything, an Immortalist.” Rodregas paused and took a deep breath.
 What he said next was hard even for himself to say, “In truth, I am an old man who had his time on this world and did not do much with it.
 But now I have stolen the body of a very promising young man.
 I will die feeling guilty for what I have done, but I plan to take a few of you with me.

She knew he was lonely, and she couldn’t stand seeing him shut himself off from any prospect of a relationship.
 Rick would probably have refused to go if he hadn’t met Sharon this weekend.
 He didn’t feel particularly attracted to her, but she was a nice girl, and that was a big improvement over his last few experiences.
 That evening he went out to the garden with the book Teri had given him.
 Sharon had been enthusiastic about the dance when he’d called to invite her.
 He’d told her he’d lend her the book, but she said that she already had some ideas about finding a drop-waist dress and a cloche hat.
 Personally, he thought the clothes were rather ugly.
 The dresses were shapeless, and the men’s pants were baggy.
 And he certainly wasn’t going to wear a raccoon coat.
 He turned the page, noticing the stockings for the first time.

 Until then, rest.

 That is all that matters.

 Aurelia had heard enough.
 She knew their roles, the balance and position of their hearts.

 That’s all he said, over and over.
 He didn’t mean to.
 He tried to stop.
 We burned the body and haven’t ever talked about it since.”
 Silence filled their clearing as Harruq’s story ended.
 “I asked for the first time you killed,” Aurelia said after an agonizingly long pause.
 “I know,” Harruq said.
 “And I did.
 I brought Perry to Qurrah.

This is something you’ll need to know for a group conflict.
 The tactics are different than one on one.” He hadn’t answered my question at all.
 But he was talking and I would take it.
 I nodded for him to go on.
 “A single opponent allows you to use more energy, focus only on that and let yourself…” My thoughts were wandering.
 Cursed dust.
 “… but with a number of opponents, you have to conserve your energy so you don’t leave yourself too weak…” I was watching his mouth move as he spoke but losing the words.
 I couldn’t focus.
 “… tactics that do not drain your energy.
 Protect yourself…” I was leaning toward him.

They played for fifty bucks a night, some beer, a little pussy.
 Early, early.
 There are names that aren’t even on the list, yet they made it all happen, for later cats, for B.
 B., for Furry, for Gatemouth.
 There’s this cat, Beaureguard somebody, played his whole life, man, his whole fucking life, lived in Midtown Memphis, played all the gigs there were back then—and we’re talking back in the Ur days, the days before electricity.
 And he lived to be, oh I don’t know, 117 or something ridiculous.
 Never made it, you know, never cut a record for Chess or whoever.
 But the music was important, it flowed through him, this cat.
 I saw him once, in a tent show—Furry was there—and he just blew everybody away, played with a broken bottle for a slide, old shitbox guitar—and he just blew everybody away.
 He’s in here man, in me, in all the cats who came after.

“I’ve been thinking about the bindings.” I turned to face him, his deep blue eyes on mine as he continued, “I was thinking there might be another way.” He was hesitant for some reason.
 “How?” I demanded, keeping the volume as low as I could, palms pressed to the smooth rock beneath us.
 What is he waiting on?
 “If… well, it seems you may have more control over your thoughts than you realize?” He phrased it as a question.
 Because of my secret.
 Was he trying to be respectful of it, or trying to keep me from getting upset?
 I wasn’t sure how to answer.
 But if it helped, if there was a way to unbind me, free my mind and get back the magic… I settled on a, “Mm-hm?” He nearly smiled.
 “Well, if you were able to… move about…” It seemed to make him uncomfortable, searching for words.
 “Then perhaps you could find a way around it.” I bit my lip and he reached up to gently pull it loose.

All I know is, everything is going to be different.
 Way different.” Karen Flagstad was a songleader.
 Her squad danced at basketball games.
 If I attended, she would wave and smile at me.
 On a Friday evening, Eric, Kenny Neidermeyer, Bill Torrey and I split a magnum of champagne on the pretense of celebrating Kenny’s parents’ divorce, which had gotten finalized that week.
 We had no other plans, so I suggested we visit the basketball game, since Karen’s wave and smile might revive my hope and cheer me.
 The game was against our team’s rival, Grossmont High School.
 My mother graduated there.
 The gym was ancient.
 The double entry doors each featured a quartet of small windows.

Mrs. Alexander shuffled over and smiled at the pair of us.
 "Sixteen grams.
 Most impressive, you two.
 An entire gram more than I would have ventured to risk myself, and done before anyone else.
 I thought the pair of you would make a great team."
 The easiest thing would have been to stay quiet and just let her believe I'd played an integral part of the project, but I didn't like getting credit for something I hadn't done.
 It was the worst kind of lying.
 "Mrs. Alexander, I didn't actually do any of it.
 I kept making mistakes."
 She chuckled so hard, for a second I thought the pencil behind her ear was going to fall out.

Outside of what we bring, there will not be much.
 But it will be a good place to rest and…” he said gently patting his stomach, “heal up.
 We should be there by nightfall.” “Not bad,” said Imeralda.
 “Sounds like a place that will be hard to find, but is this not territory infested with wild Dire beast?” “Yup,” Rodregas said, “another reason I think this area is usually hard to find; most people stay clear.” He continued after a pause to let them think of entering territory known to be the hunting range of feared predators, “I never saw any sign of any Dire beast in the hollows when I was there, but, of course, they probably know of the place.
 Still, I would rather handle a pack of Hellhounds than The Immortal Guards.” Neither looked pleased at his logic, but both nodded.
 A few hours later it was starting to get dark as Rodregas recognized the spot and turned the wagon left for the final hard assent.
 At this point there was no trail, and common sense would have argued against the path.
 It was hard work.
 The horses had to be hand-led around rocks and trees and pulled up.
 Doi’van and Rodregas had to manhandle the wagon around a few corners which was easier to do than it should have been, but Celestial and Hellborn strength together made short work of it.

Curiosity.
 Qurrah opened his eyes.
 He lay on his back in his brother’s arms, yet he didn’t remember falling.
 “You’re alright!” Harruq hugged him.
 Qurrah laughed.
 “He lost,” he said, pointing to the night sky.
 “And he doesn’t know how badly.”
 One by one, the skulls’ fire went out and they fell like morbid hail upon the city.
 “Limitless,” Qurrah said, his smile trembling.
 Blood ran from his nose, and his skin was so pale Harruq could see his veins.

Buddy called Skippy Quetzalcoatl, who had a drumming lineage like no one else’s.
 His father had been a drummer and his father before him and back and back.
 Beale Street whispers the name Quetzalcoatl, late nights when the horns have died down and the wind sloughs around shop corners and up alleyways.
 It whispers the name like a mojo, a bit of song never transcribed, a bit of the old magic.
 The abandoned gas station stood on a corner in midtown Memphis like a sepulcher, but it was soon to be transmogrified into a holy place, a place where anything could happen so beware.
 A place as bright as Sun, as holy as Stax.
 It is where Black Lung was born.
 Today it is a Taco Bell.
 But some know.
 Some still pass it by and cross themselves, hearken back to the days of divination, the days when music could save a dying nation, a nation bent on its own self-immolation.

We will not allow them so close again.” “So they’re still following?” Panic.
 “No.
 Not now.” He paused.
 “They have accomplished what they came for.
 Now they will regroup and return.
 Which is why we need to move.” “Why would we leave a fort?” He laughed.
 “Trust me, Frey.
 We have a more secure location.” I must not have appeared convinced.
 “Please,” he added.
 I sighed.

Walking down the lane, I tried to decide whether or not I wanted Brandon to show up today.
 After my mixed signals yesterday I figured there was a better than even chance he'd 'forget' to come get me.
 Strangely enough that didn't bother me as much as I thought it would.
 It was like walking down the lane managed to put things back in perspective for me.
 How could I be put out about something I hadn't ever actually believed was possible?
 I almost refused to believe my eyes when I came around the bend in our lane and saw a black Mustang parked on the side of the road.
 Brandon stood up from where he'd been leaning against the sports car and flashed me a blinding smile.
 He moved towards me with a casual grace that made little shivers run through me despite my earlier decision not to let his interest, or lack thereof, affect me.
 "I had a bet with myself that you weren't going to wait.
 Somehow the fact I just lost doesn't matter now."

We were still riding too fast and I was exhausted from the mental and physical exertion when he switched to full-body attacks.
 By nightfall I wasn’t able to fend off anything that came at me and he mercifully stopped the horses beneath another hollow in the mountain.
 I was asleep practically before I slid off my horse.
 The next morning I woke to the sound of rock against rock.
 There was no sign of Chevelle or his horse in the dim stone hollow.
 I sat up, rubbing my sore legs, unable to believe he’d left me.
 And then the rock wall struck me in the face.
 I cursed, my voice hoarse from sleep.
 The wall came at me again.
 “Okay, okay,” I shouted.

The bank president was just calling to tell me the money has been confirmed, subject to my accepting the job."
 Now was the time to strike.
 "Mom, go call Mr. Peters, and I'll start pulling your stuff together."
 It's amazing how quickly you can pack when it's for someone else, and they aren't around to tell you what you can or can't throw into their suitcase.
 Even with my lack of sleep starting to catch up with me, I was still essentially done by the time Mom wandered into her room, staring at her phone like she wasn't sure it was really possible for it to have just told her what she'd just heard.
 "He says it's fine.
 He'll swing by next week to pick up the shots I think are the most promising, and then he'll see if he can't put the brochure together from that."
 She noticed the suitcases and the empty hangers for the first time.
 "Honey, there isn't any reason to be in such a hurry.
 We haven't really decided to take the job yet, and even if we do, I'm sure we won't be able to arrange a flight for another day or two."

Those who wield national power must come to realize that force of compulsion will not bring about a permanent reconciliation and amelioration of relationships in human affairs.
 Superior power must bring with it a superior sense of fairness and a commitment to constructive dialogue and action to attack the root causes of terrorism.
 It must shed its own accretion of mental insincerity cloaked as diplomacy.
 Then and then only these movements of violence will shrink and finally disappear.
 The period following September 11th, as US National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice put it, is one “not just of grave danger, but of enormous opportunity.”
 Resolving Local Conflicts: The Commission concluded that the end of the Cold War made it possible to successfully resolve problems that had resisted solution for decades, such as the many violent communal and ethnic conflicts occurring in the world.
 The near total cessation of violence in North Ireland during the past 10 years is proof that rapid progress can be made on issues involving apparently intractable communal sentiments.
 This achievement appears astounding to those who lived through the earlier decades of religious violence and until recently found it nearly impossible to imagine a mitigation of the conflict in the foreseeable future.
 We would do well to examine closely this instance to draw lessons that may aid in addressing those conflicts that continue to defy resolution.
 The most striking lesson of the Irish experience is that rapid development absorbs and dissipates the urge for violence.

"You don't like it when I spend money on you and the more involved you get with me the less likely it is I'll be able to protect you."
 "If I let you buy me something will you quit trying to scare me off?"
 "No, but it would make me feel better."
 He said that last with his heart stopping blue eyes gazing directly into mine and I nearly stopped breathing.
 Somehow he hadn't realized yet that when he looked at me like that there wasn't anything I could deny him.
 "Ok, you can get me a present, something small and relatively inexpensive."
 Alec smiled and reached over to the backpack as he sat up.
 I let him pull me up and then felt my face freeze as he pulled out one of the largest velvet boxes I'd ever seen.
 "Alec, no."
 "It wasn't that expensive and you've already told me I could."

I hadn't actually spent every waking moment thinking about Les Misérables.
 A fair number of those seconds had been spent with Brandon.
 He'd already been picking me up from school every morning and dropping me off most days.
 We now spent every lunch together, and he'd started lingering when he dropped me off.
 It was still only on the days when Mom wasn't home, and I hadn't quite mustered the guts to invite him in, but it'd still been really nice.
 Of course it'd been the logical kind of thing to have start happening after someone asked you to the Ashure Day Dance.
 It was still so amazing someone like Brandon had asked me to go to a dance that half the time I forgot all about it.
 The other half of the time I had a hard time believing it'd really happened.
 But it had, and there were more than four dozen roses scattered around our kitchen to prove it.
 Predictably, Brandon didn't do anything halfway.

"It's beautiful.
 I never realized she was so good, Alec.
 I mean, it's the most incredible thing I've ever heard."
 His smile was a combination of pride and regret.
 "Mother says it represents my birth.
 She was always an excellent performer.
 Donovan says she would've been nationally acclaimed if she'd chosen to pursue a career instead of marrying my father.
 She didn't begin composing until after he was gone."
 In what was for me a rare display of common sense over curiosity, I shelved the rest of my questions and looked for something I could use to help him sidestep the memories.
 "Growing up surrounded by this, and neither you or Rachel play an instrument?"

“The kitchen’s all colored help,” he said.
 “Fine with me,” I countered.
 He sighed.
 “See, we only pay Negros a quarter an hour.” Minimum wage was $1.25.
 We had noticed other outrages.
 The man, woman and colored rest rooms.
 The white and colored drinking fountains in the park.
 The dearth of black customers on Bourbon Street.
 The masterful jazz artists playing in side-street storefronts for nothing but spare change.
 By the end of Mardi Gras, at midnight, while we were entering the rundown neighborhood between the French Quarter and our car, a policeman warned us not to go that way.

I debated searching through them all, but it would just mean another fight if I did find them.
 With a sigh of resignation I walked over to the chair where I'd left my selections from the night before, and pulled the faded jeans up my frail-looking legs.
 I finished up with a tank top, covered by a light blue blouse.
 All Cindi's stuff.
 Thoughts of her were just as dangerous as they'd been last night, but maybe I was getting a little better.
 Feeling like a traitor, I headed my skittering thoughts off before they could start affecting me physically, and focused on the next step in getting ready.
 There was a lot more at stake this morning than last night.
 If I fell apart now I might not make it to school, and then I'd have all kinds of trouble calming Mom back down when she returned from wherever she'd gone.
 My hair hung as limp and straight as always.
 No amount of styling ever made it look any better, just more contrived.

 So I guess I’ll see you there?” “Of course, Jason, I’ll tell Emily.” “I’ll tell Seth then.
 See ya.” Emily’s voice came back.
 “Well, who was it?” “It was Jason, he found the meeting place,” I said.
 “It’s the public art piece we use to climb.” “That makes sense.” She paused.
 “I have to go, dinner.” “Bye Emily,” I whispered.
 “See you tomorrow.” “Bye.” She clicked off.
 After dinner I was laying in bed, my mind spinning.
 I still couldn’t believe where I was going tomorrow.

Even as they stood there, he watched several orcs go running past, howling murder.
 “We will partake in our own way,” Qurrah said, kneeling beside the orc.
 The savage clutched his stomach, his hands the only thing holding in his innards.
 Qurrah’s thin, ashen face curled into a sneer.
 Harruq turned away.
 Perhaps his brother would think him weak, but he would not watch.
 He heard a sudden shriek of pain that morphed into a long, drawn-out moan.
 As the last of the air left the orc’s lungs, Harruq turned around, startled by the sight.
 “Beauty in all things,” Qurrah said, purple light dancing across his face.
 “Especially those things that are controlled.”

 I'd gone to school on Tuesday after receiving his amazing, 'anonymous' gift the day before, only to be ambushed at lunch.
 I'd been anxiously waiting for him at his normal table when a pair of employees from the local florist had walked in, their arms overflowing with roses.
 I'd been expecting them to stop in front of Jasmin.

According to some mysterious cosmic whimsy or brutal plan, Eric had to die and I didn’t.
 So I filed the matter away with other mysteries, of which life offers plenty.
 But on this trip with all its remembering, I may solve the mystery.
 The End of Something Else
 A couple weeks after Eric's funeral, Cliff and I decided we should quit school and move to San Francisco.
 When school let out that day, we went up the street to La Mesa Junior High and found my mom grading papers on the patio behind her classroom.
 We told her our plans and listened while she recited all the reasons leaving now, three months short of graduation, was all wrong.
 She even tried to bribe us, offering to help with money if we would wait until June and apply to a San Francisco college.
 "Nope," I said.
 "If we wait, we probably won't go."

I would like to thank the staff of Narconon and every other facility that helps our addicts attempt to identify and handle the demon they cannot resist.
 I would like to thank Chris Tillman for encouraging me to turn my cathartic writings into a book to share my story with others.
 I would like to thank my mother for being the best mother she could be despite astronomical obstacles that faced a single parent in the 60’s with no financial support from her first husband and an abusive second husband.
 Mom, we never knew how hard life was for you because you made sure we came first and you protected us the best you could!
 To my son Bryce, I would like to thank you for all of your accomplishments and helping me as a father not have a complete melt down because at least I knew I wasn’t a complete failure as a Dad.
 You gave me the hope and courage to continue to try to understand your brother and his drug addiction and eventually the addiction of others.
 And a special Thank You to my editor, Robin Martin of Two Songbirds Press, for believing in my story and my ability to convey it.
 I couldn’t have completed this without you!

 Rick smiled, shrugging.
 "There are some problems, but yeah, it's serious."
 "Good.

 It was nearly midnight when they left.

In the morning after meditation, Doi’van pulled forth two wooden staves that he had cut and said with a smile and an exaggerated wink, “Apparently you are healed up from your wound now, so I think it is time to stop with these making of shadows like children and time for some more physical training.” As he finished speaking he tossed Rodregas one of the staves.
 “With my people we teach our children to fight using the staff.
 It is hard to kill someone by accident with a staff, but you can still deliver pain.
 The avoidance of pain is a great way to teach someone to be nimble and quick.
 My war masters at the palace would say you two are too old to learn the staff, but it is the way that I know.” “Sir Paladin,” he said to Rodregas, imposing the unearned honor title.
 “I assume with your training from all your ex-knights that you know how to use the staff?” As Doi’van spoke he looked at how Rodregas was holding the staff.
 “Fight with a staff?” Rodregas responded in surprise.
 “No, can’t say that I ever have.
 The weapons of the Knight are the sword, the mace, the lance and the bow.
 Those are the weapons of a warrior,” he stated.

Whatever I was expecting from Alec and Rachel's reactions, I didn't get it.
 The airy, sunlit room we walked into was almost like being outside.
 There were a number of plants scattered about the space, some resting on the floor, others on a variety of slender stands.
 The effect was ethereal.
 It was hard to imagine that any of the spun-metal stands could support anything more substantial than a box of Kleenex.
 It wasn't until we were further inside that I realized there was an entire alcove off to one side, almost completely dominated by a black grand piano.
 The piano was so breathtaking it was several seconds before I realized there was someone sitting at it.
 "Alec.
 I'm so glad you're safe.
 Rachel was going on and on about some kind of problem with the pack.

For my family, who encouraged me to never stop fighting for my dreams ♥
 Chapter 1
 Summer vacation’s supposed to be fun, right?
 I wish I had a better answer to that question.
 Starlings, New York is not the place you’d expect much to happen.
 It’s a small quiet town, the kind where everyone knows your name.
 It’s a place where your parents wouldn’t even care if you stayed out late biking with your friends.
 Only because everyone felt so safe, so comfy.
 They don’t know the half of it.
 But I do.

A sense of exaltation soared through both necromancers as Ahrqur opened his eyes and snarled.
 “Rise, slave,” Velixar commanded.
 “Your soul is trapped in your body and answers only to my command.”
 The naked elf rose, his eyes burning with red rage.
 The symbols on his body faded until they were but faint scars.
 “Give him his clothes,” Velixar ordered his student.
 Qurrah fetched a pair of black pants, a red shirt, and a black cloak, all of which Velixar had prepared before the brothers had brought the bloodless body to him.
 “Dress,” the necromancer ordered.
 Ahrqur growled some inane argument, but a glare from Velixar sent him cowering.
 “You must obey my every command, wretch, before you may return to the peaceful death you left.

"I want everyone back to their regular desks and hard at work on their assignments."
 Mrs. Campbell wasn't as pale as she'd been when she'd left, but she still looked unsettled and more than a little unhappy, presumably with both whatever had caused her to leave so quickly, and the fact that she'd come back to a class where almost nobody had been doing anything productive.
 I had a couple of heartbeats to hope she'd realized I'd been trying to help Britney with her homework, and therefore not deserving of any punishment.
 "Britney, Adriana, I'll need to speak with you both after the bell."
 Apparently the whole justice thing was on the fritz right now.
 It would probably start working again just in time to punish me for whatever bad thing I did next.
 I tried to work on my homework some more, but my heart wasn't in it, so I just sat at my desk and tried not to look like I was pouting.
 All too soon class was over, and I found myself trailing Britney up to Mrs. Campbell's desk.
 She still didn't look very happy, but there was a trace more self-control to her face than a few minutes before.
 "Britney, despite spending at least an hour at the tutor lab each afternoon, the quality of your homework hasn't come up in the slightest, so I took the liberty of talking to your father yesterday."

I slunk out of class as soon as the bell rang.
 English went better.
 Mr. Whethers got the class involved in a discussion of Heathcliff's motivations, which kept everyone occupied for the full class time, and distracted me from what was likely to happen when Britney and I got to algebra.
 As we walked back to our lockers between classes, I noticed that the halls seemed strangely empty.
 Britney rolled her eyes when I asked why.
 "Of course nobody's here.
 Tonight's the full moon, and there was a monster party last night.
 There'll be another tonight and then again tomorrow."
 I felt my eyes go big.
 "You mean to tell me that seventy percent of the school parties for three nights running every month?"

She'd always thought she was too well endowed to look good in any of the clothes she liked, but now she couldn't imagine binding it.
 Besides, she liked wearing the lacy bras she'd brought from 2011.
 "Marie," her mother said quietly, taking her daughter's arm as they left the store, "does the young man you met have anything to do with your decision to stop binding your chest?"
 "He just told me that that's not the style in--where he lives.
 He bought me clothes, and they looked and fit better without the binding."
 "Why didn't you bring any of those clothes with you?"
 "They-they aren't in style here."
 She thought of the shorts and jeans and white sundress Rick had bought her.
 She definitely wouldn't have had any use for them here.
 And of course, the bathing suit.

He wrapped his arms around me as I turned again to see my mother.
 A howl of rage escaped her and I started to go to her, but he held me.
 He was restraining me.
 I thrashed against him as I tried to scream, to tell him to let me go, but I had no voice.
 She reached her hand out and I could not move, could not help her, though I knew she was dying.
 I was imprisoned there, unable to move… unable to scream… unable to save her.
 And then I couldn’t see her.
 Something was covering my eyes.
 I struggled yet again but my body felt like lead—heavy, useless.
 Darkness enveloped me and I was underwater, struggling to reach the surface, desperate for air.

She'd see an elegant necktie that would be perfect for Rick and then realize she could never give it to him.
 She'd known she'd miss him, but she'd thought that the excitement of being home would lessen that feeling.
 She was wrong.
 "Where would you like to go now?"
 her mother asked her when they'd finished their lunch.
 "Home."
 "Home?
 We've only been to two shops."
 "I'm a little tired.
 I'd just like to go home."

Marie screamed, almost knocking Rick off his feet when she leapt into his arms.
 "Thank you, thank you, thank you!
 I can't believe it!"
 She hugged him hard and kissed his cheek.
 "Do you mean it?"
 "Of course I mean it.
 That would be a terrible joke."
 "Oh, Rick, thank you so much!
 I'm going to go pack."
 She turned to go upstairs.

Or maybe a pagan homecoming since it's still fall."
 Prom was my arch-nemesis.
 There were really only two times a year that the universe managed to penetrate my historical indifference to the opposite sex.
 Prom, and Valentine's Day.
 Of the two, Prom was the more deadly.
 Valentine's Day was usually filled with enough examples of guys screwing up to make me feel okay.
 They were always picking the wrong present, forgetting to buy one, or otherwise making the day less than perfect.
 That in turn helped me remember that most relationships seemed to be more fuss and mess than they were worth.
 Why get something built up so much in your mind that you can't possibly ever realize it?
 All of the little things about Valentine's Day that grounded me in reality were overcome by the mystique of Prom.

Anyways they could push the beds together from time to time.
 Liz – They couldn’t push the beds together though, they sleep in different rooms.
 Jim – I’m surprised that each of them doesn’t have their own porn collections that rival my dad’s.
 Liz – They don’t need to buy porn.
 Jim – They visit each other’s rooms then?
 Liz – No, they hardly talk to each other.
 Jim – How do they manage staying sane?
 Liz - Well dad has his secretary, I think anyways.
 And mom, well she has the gardener, the pool boy, the mail-man, and any other strait male human being who is unfortunate to come across her path, and a few who don’t even get that close.
 Jim – Sounds like your mom is busy, and that would explain a few things.

If I believe in Mother Teresa, I should read about her and talk to those who knew her and attend to whatever I learn.
 To the extent that we follow Christ’s example, give of our selves, our time and resources to help people in need, allow time away from the crowds to contemplate and pray, put aside our self concerns and turn to concern for others, our minds and hearts get invaded and possessed by the Holy Spirit.
 And in that condition, the world transforms before our eyes.
 For passing out food, clothing or loving concern we always get blessed, and while we live with a blessed attitude, the most bedraggled people may appear possessed of astonishing beauty, as God must see them.
 When we follow the example of Jesus, through his blessing we begin to perceive the glorious reality of all creation.
 In other words, we enter heaven in all its beauty.
 Beauty
 James 4: 17 in the King James declares, “Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.” The New International Version reads “Anyone, then, who knows the good he ought to do and doesn’t do it, sins."
 The New American Standard’s version is, “Therefore, to one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it, to him it is sin.” Put these translations together, they insist that to do good is the right thing and what we ought to do.
 But even in consort, they don’t explain why we ought to do good or why we should avoid sin.

These addicts need professional help from those who are trained in this field.
 We are ignorant and ill prepared to help and understand an addict and that ignorance could be deadly.
 We can only pray that these addicts can overcome their addiction and start living a clean and sober life one day at a time.

In the Second World War, the ratio was one to one.
 In the Korean War, civilian deaths out numbered military losses five to one.
 In the Vietnam War, this ratio rose to 20 to one.
 Advances in the sophistication and dissemination of modern military technology have fuelled this trend.
 The Iran–Iraq War, the war in Afghanistan and the Gulf War involved the use of ballistic missiles against civilian centres.
 In all, over 5,000 surface-to-surface missiles have targeted population centres during the last five decades.
 The devastating effect of even conventional weapons on economic activity and society in general is so great that today no developed nation can afford the costs of military confrontation, either at home or overseas.
 No longer can non-combatants sit quietly on the sidelines or work productively undisturbed.
 War both between and within states has come to involve and affect all of society.
 Infrastructure and production facilities have become a principal target of military action.

Even if I can't let go of Zoë, I could more thoroughly rid myself of ambition.
 Maybe I should give up writing.
 Or hand over Perelandra College to someone.
 Spend more time growing vegetables and cooking from scratch, like Brother Lawrence did.
 Toni Torrey could give me gardening and cooking lessons.
 For lessons in devoting myself to communion with God, besides contemplating Brother Lawrence, I can turn to Olga.
 Peace
 Olga Savitsky was a poet.
 We met at a small church charismatic enough so that nobody minded when she stood in the midst of a service and offered her latest poem.
 Long ago, Olga had discovered that what she needed most was God.

It was loud, strong, and seemed to shake the earth to those before it.
 When he crashed into the line of guards, the blood ran quick and free.
 Of the seven, only two stood their ground against the glowing blades.
 One swung his sword in a high, round arc while the other stabbed forward, hoping to gut the half-orc because of his charge.
 Harruq’s charge, though, was far from mindless.
 His speed far beyond the guard’s, he knocked the stab away, then shifted his weight so that both Salvation and Condemnation blocked the other attack.
 The weaker blade shattered against the magic of the twin swords.
 One weaponless and the other horribly positioned, the two were defenseless.
 Salvation took a throat.
 Condemnation pierced rib and lung.

"I like the white one.
 It really shows off your tan."
 Rick watched as Marie turned in front of the mirror, inspecting the white sundress.
 She looked sweet and sexy at the same time.
 "But I don't have any shoes to wear with it."
 "We'll buy you some."
 She'd been so depressed the day after their conversation about lovemaking that he'd told her they'd go shopping tonight and to the beach tomorrow--and even Sunday, if the sunscreen worked.
 She went to him, looping her arms about his neck.
 "Thank you," she said, raising her lips to his.
 She seemed to have recovered, Rick mused as he watched her try on white sandals half an hour later.

I don’t know.
 Anyway, she takes it out---and this is like the first time either of us has bared anything except our souls and she was just fascinated with it.
 And I don’t know where this knowledge comes from but she knew immediately how to do what needed to be done.
 She was jerking on me so expertly—well, hell, maybe anything feels right the first time—and, very quickly—I was young---I squirted all over both of us.
 It was a surprise.
 I don’t know what she expected to happen but there was this like fountain, as if I had stored it up for a decade, and there was some on her hand, her forearm, her shirt.
 And the look on her face (laughs) well, let’s just say, it was obvious that it was not what she expected.
 But, she liked it.
 And, so we continued our experiments.
 Now, how this impacted my music, which was also coming, so to speak, is, on the simplest level, obvious.

"I can't promise he'll even read it."
 It was a he who'd intervened on our behalf, and Rachel and Alec's father had died years ago, while Brandon's father...actually I knew next to nothing about Brandon's parents.
 I wasn't even sure whether or not they were around.
 They must be though--if it had been a male who'd saved us, then it couldn't be the Graveses, and that left only Brandon's family.
 It was hard to believe that Brandon had stepped in and done so much for us, but the pieces fit together so tightly.
 Brandon was even more wonderful and amazing than I'd thought before.
 Part of me expected this new revelation to keep my mind whirling so fast that it would take me hours to go to sleep.
 I was only partly right.
 It took quite a while for me to go to sleep, but this time the culprit was the light outside my window.
 Chapter 14 For the first time in longer than I could remember, I woke up two minutes before my alarm went off.

Jim – Yep.
 Liz – What did he say?
 Jim – Well, the first thing out of his mouth was “who the hell are you?”
 Liz – I told you that you should have talked to him sooner.
 Jim – He said the same thing,  at least after he figured out who I was.
 But then he told me that I was just about 20 credits from graduating, and at the end of this semester I would only need 8 more.
 Liz – Did he say anything else?
 Jim – He also asked why I had taken the Mayan art class, and a few others.
 I explained and in the end he seemed to have been happy to see me getting ready to leave.
 Liz – You’re impossible.

To my surprise, the leaves turned up and the head began to turn green.
 The stem reached out new roots and new buds began to form.
 I gasped.
 Junnie swirled around.
 “What?
 What did you find?” “No, I was just… there was a thistle here…” It was all that had developed, the bulbs and seedlings were undisturbed, and I couldn’t help but think, Oh, sure, the weed grows.
 Junnie was across the room in a flash.
 She glanced at the changed thistle and then, briefly, me, but when I tried to meet her gaze, it shifted to the wall of books.
 “Well, good for you, Frey.
 Your efforts are finally paying off.” I stared blankly at her.

Van’dret hurried through the open doors before the guard changed his mind.
 He normally found the sight of the Immortal Guards reassuring; the great sigil warriors were sworn to the protection of Immortalist, like himself, but he knew these two would cut him down like a common pauper if they sensed he was a danger to their Master.
 There was a short hallway leading from the doors with slim white columns on each side of the hallway, in between each column hung great pieces of art; paintings, sculptures and even a small wall hanging with amazing vibrant colors with a strange abstract design were all preserved in the space.
 Van’dret was a man of some refinement and appreciation for art, and he wished he had dared to stop and inspect the pieces; they had to be some of the greatest art works in the Realm to be so on display where only those who had been invited to a private meeting with Taiga would see them.
 However Van’dret dared to do nothing more than glance at them as he hurried forward.
 It would not be smart to make the Guild Dealer wait for even a moment.
 The Guild Dealer Taiga was not such a common man that he did his work from a desk; his desires and commands came during parties and social events.
 However, if you were truly honored, though personal invitations to dine with him in his personal solar overlooking his city you would get told his wishes.
 As Van’dret stepped through the arch he was struck by the bare simplicity of the solar.
 The city known as the Menagerie of Sky, Earth and Water that Taiga ruled and had created over the centuries was a lush place, full of pleasures and growing things.

They will be generated across all sectors of the economy, most especially in construction, transportation and utilities, education and health services, wholesale trade, and financial services.
 Employment is not a zero sum game.
 Computerization: The exciting growth of ICT-based service exports by no means exhausts the potential contribution of computers to growth of employment opportunities.
 Computerization is not merely a field or sector of commercial activity.
 The computer is an instrument and a catalyst that can stimulate creation of employment and self-employment opportunities in virtually every field – from farming, fishing and textile designing to lean manufacturing, financial services, bio-informatics and genetic engineering.
 While the application of computers has already been extended to all these fields, there has not yet been a systematic effort to assess the employment potential that can be tapped by fully extending and accelerating this movement.
 The recent initiative in India to establish knowledge centres in every Indian village by 2007 is one example of a pioneering effort to harness ICT as a means to catalyze a whole range of on-farm and off-farm rural activities, which will inevitably translate into more and higher productivity and greater employment generation.
 These centres can be utilized to deliver technological expertise to upgrade farm yields, vocational training and education, purchasing and marketing information to raise incomes.
 The experience of India also shows that bridging the digital divide helps to bridge the gender divide in the area of knowledge and skill-intensive work.
 As the construction of rural roads acts as a stimulus to agricultural development of isolated communities by connecting them with sources of inputs and markets in the outer world, ICT can be a catalyst for stimulating the entire gamut of economic activities in rural communities throughout the developing world.

In the earliest phase, these resources were almost exclusively material.
 The next phase brought the discovery of tools and instruments that made the material resources far more productive and valuable than before.
 Gradually, society discovered rudimentary organizational resources – the capacity to organize productive activities in a more effective manner.
 The organization of farming utilized the tree to make a plough with which to cultivate repeatedly the same land, giving birth to sedentary societies.
 The organization of crafts, commerce, armies, governments – constructed from a fabric of customs, rules, systems and laws – each made use of the material resources for greater productivity, power and achievement.
 At each stage of this evolution, society discovered the power of knowledge to increase further the productivity of the material, technological and organizational resources at its disposal.
 A knowledge of weather patterns boosted productivity in agriculture.
 A knowledge of astronomy enabled sea-worthy vessels to travel across the oceans to distant lands.
 This led to the invention of systematic education as a method to pass on acquired knowledge and skills to the next generation and thereby continuously increase them.

My blank look apparently made her take pity on me.
 "I'm sorry.
 I forget you're not aware of my special gift.
 I see inside people.
 Shape shifters really, but every once in a while normal humans as well.
 I can see their potential, and when they develop gifts, I can see the shape those gifts have taken."
 "Gifts?"
 "The most powerful of the Fir'shan, the hybrids as the younger generation calls them, occasionally develop unusual abilities.
 Alec's father's was that of being able to heal himself more rapidly than normal, even for our kind.

It all sucked big time.
 My pride would take a back seat to Brandon’s needs.
 His drug problem was more important than the grudge I was holding over my brother’s drug-induced antics.
 I felt like I was selling out.
 But somewhere in my heart I guess I had always hoped that Thomas and I would mend the damage between us.
 That one day I could forgive.
 That one day our families would spend a holiday together, and that holiday would lead to another and eventually things would be as normal as they could be.
 Part of me also felt that my older brother was in need of a way to get back in good graces of the family and that maybe I could give this to him by reaching out.
 I contacted Thomas in desperation, and he did have the connections to get my son into Narconon, a private rehab program that we couldn’t afford.
 We put the word out through some of Brandon’s friends that his Uncle Thomas could help him get into this private rehab if he wanted the help, but Brandon had to want it.

Even more amazing, the feeling was strong enough to carry me through Biology and Mrs. Sorenson's relentless grilling.
 I did better than expected, but still not as well as I'd hoped.
 Not considering how much time I'd spent studying.
 It was like she knew exactly which parts I didn't understand completely, and after letting me start to get a little bit of false confidence, she'd hammer me down again.
 Talk about depressing.
 Still, I was feeling well-prepared for my English test tomorrow and Algebra flew by.
 By my latest calculations I was only about two weeks from being all caught up.
 Lunch was interesting.
 I was still the odd man out, but it was amusing watching Vincent preen.
 I never did figure out what it was he'd done, but apparently it had him thinking he was even more of a stud than normal.

I shoved it back in my pocket and continued walking.
 The sun was almost gone and shadows were starting to appear behind everything.
 I looked at my own shadow, that danced behind me.
 The phone buzzed again as Seth sent me a reply.
 See anything?
 Do you want me to meet you?
 I glanced at the nearby woods.
 My ears heard nothing and I didn’t see any movement but my hands shook slightly as I typed, Nothing, I’m fine.
 I didn’t open his reply because I knew what it would say.
 I already knew that it was strangely quiet.

All that matters is that he learned those words before he met me.
 He whispered something, opened his hands, and then just like that the mouse got up and started running.”
 “He brought it to life?” she asked.
 “Well…” Again he stopped, obviously uneasy about what he wanted to say.
 “It was still dead, but it was moving now.
 That make sense?
 Qurrah could make it do whatever he wanted.
 He let it run off and die, that first one he showed me.
 He was pretty shy about it.
 Don’t think he had any idea how I would react.”

Rodregas could feel the wetness of blood on his toes and he felt like he was going to slip at any moment.
 He breathed deep and yelled, “I am climbing the damn ‘One Tree,’ what does it look like?
 Now, shut up before I fall.”  He continued his climb, finally reaching a branch.
 The branch was on such a scale that he had to climb the branch coming up its side.
 The bark of the branch was smoother and offered less of a grip.
 Finally he got to the top, which was broad and actually rather cup-like against the main trunk.
 Though he worried about Imeralda, he let himself rest for a moment to recover.
 After a few minutes Rodregas got up and looked around for Imeralda.
 He saw that she was actually far out on another impossibly think branch.
 By the Infernals he swore to himself.

"I bet you don't have frozen yogurt in 1927."
 "No," she replied, intrigued.
 "What is it?"
 "It's like ice cream but better for you.
 The flavors are on that board.
 What sounds good to you?"
 She couldn't make up her mind between chocolate-covered cherry and chocolate almond, so he asked for a sample of each.
 When she at last chose the former, he ordered a waffle cone of it for her--inspired to have M & Ms added at the last minute--and a cone of pecan praline for himself.
 "What do you think?"
 he asked after they'd sat down and begun eating.

 Anyway, those little fuckers defy your best efforts, they’re almost always gonna be quicker than you.
 That’s what writing is, man, it just keeps going farther into the sand, the thing you’re looking for, the thing that’ll make it all alright.
 It just stays beyond you, just out of your grasp.
 And that’s how it should be, man, because otherwise why would you keep digging?
 Why keep looking if it’s easy to find?
 What were we talking about?
 CM:  	Uh…some people see in your “California” LPs a kind of return to innocence, a willful perspective that is more Edenic, or childlike.
 Would you say that you are seeking innocence with your recent work, that you are moving toward artlessness?
 BG:  	You would say that.

He was fierce and wore a long scar across his brow that touched his cheek.
 He kept his hair cropped short, not wanting to hide any part of the damage.
 And my mother, though my dreams gave her two names.
 Dark hair, blowing in the wind, arms outstretched, the pendant hanging at her neck glowing fiercely.
 Fire, flames, burning.
 And then water.
 Drowning.
 Over and over and over.
 It almost made the cliff dreams more bearable, to be away from the repetitive drowning.
 I swam around in these impressions for what seemed like an eternity.

“Imeralda, I want to make sure you want to continue with us.
 I mean I love to travel with you, but while Doi’van and I are warriors, when you joined us it was only as a travel companion.
 If you want to stay with the village or stay with Jordaan I will understand.
 You know that by now they will be hunting us, if not because of Ravenhurr’s death, than because of the missing Immortal Guards.” “You know that I probably killed more slavers with the Black Yew bow than either you or Doi’van right?” asked Imeralda with a snort.
 “Your abilities are not of question,” Rodregas responded.
 “Your abilities as a Forest Nymph and as an archer make you a very deadly woman.
 As you gain control over your magical powers you will only become more dangerous.
 The question is whether you want to fight?” Imeralda nodded and she hesitated.
 “I will be honest,” she said.
 “I am a little torn, I have never been as afraid as during and after the battle.

The next two hours floated by, and before I would've believed it possible, I found myself heading towards the tutoring lab.
 Rachel met me outside the door, her face lit up with a smile even more striking than her usual expression.
 "You won.
 I'm so excited that you won.
 Guess what.
 I traded tickets with Suzanne Bergerman, so we get to sit together!"
 Life couldn't get any better.
 I was going to Les Misérables with Rachel, and I only had two more hours before Brandon would be taking me home.
 Chapter 16 My time with Brandon blurred by too quickly.
 It was like the time between when he picked me up and dropped me off didn't even exist.

"Adriana, you're struggling in two classes already.
 How do you propose to handle yet another set of homework?"
 I felt my mouth slam shut.
 He knew everything about everyone, but it still somehow caught me by surprise that he knew so much about me.
 "But they'll hate me even more."
 I already wished I could take it back, but it was too late.
 It took less than half a second for him to figure out who I was talking about.
 "They don't hate you.
 A few of them are scared almost senseless, but nobody hates you."
 "They were willing to kill me.

While it didn't sound like anyone was out-and-out yelling, they weren't the calm voices of friendly conversation.
 I quickly reversed direction, and found an external door less than a minute later.
 The voices had faded away to nearly nothing as I'd gotten further away from them, but all of a sudden they peaked into a full-blown yelling match, punctuated with an incredible crash that sent a tremor through the entire house.
 Any thoughts I'd had about trying to find a phone and calling 911 vanished as full flight instinct took a hold.
 A few seconds later I was outside and running.
 The moon was so obscured by clouds it provided only minimal light, but even the poor visibility couldn't convince me to slow my flight through the near jungle waiting outside the house.
 I could barely make out the stone path that led through the garden, but I stumbled along it as quickly as I could with my sprained ankle, deciding between branches in the path completely at random.
 I'd only been running for a few seconds when lightning tore its first gash in the night sky and opened up the way for a monsoon-like rainstorm.
 Within a few seconds the cold rain was falling so hard that I couldn't see even a few feet ahead of me.
 I started shivering instantly.

I saw Emily sitting there, saying nothing for once.
 Something fell off my back and I picked it up.
 It was a wooden bow, and when I reached behind my back I felt a quiver full of feathered arrows strapped there.
 I ran a finger over the smooth, dark wood and turned to see Seth crashing out of the woods.
 I smirked at him and pointed at his head.
 “You have dark blue hair.” I giggled, not knowing why I was giggling after what had just happened to us a few minutes ago.
 He frowned and pulled a piece or two out of his head.
 His eyes widened, and I laughed at the shock on his face.
 If we were dead, which was my best guess, why not poke fun at him?
 Seth smiled at me.

Rodregas said, “The local lord is responsible for replacing the other lord messenger’s lame horse.
 There is nothing to be done for the Immortalist messenger’s horse.
 It is the responsibility of the local lords to provide mounts for the Guild at the local lord’s expense.” He made sure his voice remained rough with no emotion coloring his response, just a simple squire giving a by-the-book answer.
 The Knight Captain nodded and said, “Welcome to the tournament, Squire.” He then turned to look up at the sorcerer and asked him, “Any other questions Ambassador?” The sorcerer spoke his next question directly to Rodregas, “I noticed you have a Hellborn at your side, you would insult the faith of the Knights by bringing him into the Cathedral of the Heavens?” Rodregas knew this question would come up and had the natural answer, “They are my sworn followers.
 Sworn to the All-Father.” Such an oath could not be challenged here.
 “Truly?” the sorcerer said.
 “The Great Oath of Fealty for one of Infernal birth?
 I would see that.” He turned to Doi’van who loomed over all of them.
 Doi’van had watched the show with a cold interest.
 The sorcerer spoke with a command that dripped venom, “On your knees Hellborn and swear the oath of fealty, in the name of the All-Father to this squire where we can all see.” Doi’van paused for a heartbeat and then pulled his sword out in a smooth gesture and for a moment Rodregas was thinking that a battle was to be had, but then Doi’van dropped to his knees in front of Rodregas.

"Well, I'll probably have to work late tomorrow too."
 She stared at him in dismay.
 "That's the surprise?"
 He laughed.
 "No.
 I have to work late because of the surprise.
 I have quite a bit of vacation time coming, and I thought I'd take some next week.
 Since I'm not giving much notice, I have a lot of things I have to take care of tomorrow."
 If a vacation was the surprise, it must include her, but she didn't want to make any assumptions.
 "What plans have you made for your vacation?"

He backed up from his confused opponents and gave himself more space.
 It was the middle of the night and there was only a sliver of moon, but he could still make out the forms of his attackers; there were four of them.
 No, a fifth stood away from the others and watched.
 The one who had stabbed him had the most aggressive posture: he looked tall and strong; Rodregas knew he had to take him out quickly so he moved in hard.
 None of the attackers seemed to be wearing armor nor did they have any weapons, other than the largest man, who held what looked to be a garden rake.
 Rodregas charged, bulling his way into the lead attacker and knocking him down.
 The assailant fell, being surprised by Rodregas’ actions.
 Rodregas grabbed him by the hair with his left hand and hit him full in the nose with his right fist.
 The man crumbled.
 Two others closed in with a group tackle.

He appeared to regret saying it.
 “Did she tell you”—I wasn’t sure I should be admitting this—“I read her book?” “Yes.” He wasn’t offering any information.
 I would have to ask.
 The dust must have given me courage.
 “It talked about exchange.” Still nothing.
 “About energy… life… for magic.” He cleared his throat.
 “Yes.” “Can you tell me about it?” “Today, after Anvil sparred with Steed, you saw how the strike drained him.
 This is something you’ll need to know for a group conflict.
 The tactics are different than one on one.” He hadn’t answered my question at all.
 But he was talking and I would take it.

 BG:  	Right.
 A fine guy, a good guy.
 He’s such a gentle man, you know?
 Gentleman and gentle man.
 He’s probably the most centered cat I know.
 And, music, well, he just drips music.
 It comes out of his fingertips like liquid electricity, I’ve never played with anyone better.
 It’s all so effortless for him.
 And he lives it, music and spirituality, what we’re all really looking for, what we all really want our lives to be.

People would come and go as they purchased their cocaine all day and all night.
 The big buyers would be treated to a sampling right out of the giant pile.
 Thomas would drag out a “rock” of cocaine from the massive pile and crack it open as if he was cutting a diamond.
 The story of its origin and quality were described as if you were listening to a reading from a science fiction novelist.
 To watch these people hang on every word of his bullshit was sickening to me.
 Their wild eyes and grinding jaws were just the physical part of their bizarre behavior.
 People would hover next to windows, peeking out every few seconds, check the locks on the same doors over and over again as their paranoia increased with every line they snorted.
 There was no deterring Thomas from his occupation, as he believed himself invincible—as all drug dealers do.
 I had watched other old friends get hauled off to jail and I didn’t want the same for my brother.
 One afternoon, I called Thomas and a strange voice picked up the phone.

He’d be selling Krystals.
 Because he ain’t that smart.
 But, yeah, we were cracking up even as we rose.
 Maybe rising causes dissolution, right, you can dig that.
 Like Icarus.
 Or, it’s like Adam and Eve, you know, paradise is full of apples, full of snakes.
 We were in paradise briefly, as we cut that album, made those songs happen, we had it all, chicks, drugs, some money—though they screwed us of course.
 We should have been bigger, gotten better contracts.
 I don’t care about that.
 But, I do care about my songs, man, my damn songs.

"I almost forgot.
 Guess what, Les Misérables is coming to Las Vegas.
 Not just a local cast, an actual touring cast out of London.
 It's gotten excellent reviews all over the U.S." I stared at her blankly, unsure where she was going.
 Some of her enthusiasm wilted in the face of my incomprehension.
 "I just thought maybe you'd want to go.
 You know.
 You said you loved the music, that it was what made you want to read the book.
 It's playing for more than a month, so there's plenty of time to make arrangements.
 I can set everything up if you want."

“Hmm.
 I’m not supposed to take you outside.
 Not supposed to leave you.” I stood, waiting.
 “Food,” she decided.
 She yanked two cloaks from the corner and tied them on, covering our heads, and led me to the wardrobe by her bed.
 I couldn’t imagine how we could get any more clothes on as she opened the door and started to throw them onto her bed.
 But she leaned out of the wardrobe door to whisper, “Come on.” She stepped into the cabinet, dragging me with her.
 We were standing outside the rear of her house.
 She slid the false wall back in place and grabbed my arm again, our heavy cloaks moving like shadows as we ran from the village.
 We didn’t go far before she stopped and jerked me into a squat beside her.

Johnny – What would they call it then?
 Jim – Drunkenness.
 Or plain stupidity.
 Eugene’s dad never leaves the house anyways.
 The train would have to crash through his bedroom wall to get to him.
 Johnny – Well it might happen.
 Jim – That house is at least 10 miles from any railroad tracks.
 The man has a better chance of being struck by lightning while winning the lottery than he does of being hit by a train while sitting in his bedroom.
 I’m pretty sure Gene’s father won’t be hit by a train.

"No worries, it just seemed like the thing to do at the time.
 Why did she want to hurt you anyways?"
 Rachel looked down, but somehow it wasn't a gesture that conveyed guilt.
 "It's complicated."
 I'd spent too much time with emotions and thoughts floating around in my own head that I didn't want examined too closely.
 I wasn't about to pry if there was something she didn't want to tell me.
 "I guess that's fair.
 Let me know if you have any more questions."
 Rachel nodded, and then turned back to her book, apparently having used up her store of courage for the afternoon.
 I stopped by Britney's desk to ask if she needed any help, and had to avoid an attempt to suck me into another gripe session about Mrs. Campbell.

Last I heard, she was on her way to a convent in Switzerland.
 At least that is what she said in the letter.
 Karen – Oh my god…
 Art – That was right after she told myself and our two sons that we were evil sinners and that we were going to hell.
 That and she hated us for tainting her so.
 Karen – I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to…
 Art – What for?
 It happened several years ago.
 Karen –I didn’t mean to drudge up old pain.
 Art - Ah, it still does hurt a little.

I was somehow faster than normal, and spent what seemed like hours chasing around slivers of light that turned out to be some kind of long, thin fish.
 For perhaps the first time in my entire life I didn't mind at all that I'd ended up in a swimsuit so small I might as well have been wearing nothing at all.
 In fact, the feel of the warm water sliding past my skin was so incredible I almost considered skinny dipping.
 Of course that'd only lasted for about a nanosecond.
 Even in a dream, there were things that were just too scary to really entertain.
 The dream lasted longer than any of the others before it, but even so it eventually lapsed into a normal, boring dream.
 Still, I woke up feeling more refreshed and rested than any other time I could remember.
 Even more amazing, the feeling was strong enough to carry me through Biology and Mrs. Sorenson's relentless grilling.
 I did better than expected, but still not as well as I'd hoped.
 Not considering how much time I'd spent studying.

I couldn’t help but regret the flames had consumed the documents that had caused all this to begin with.
 I should have fully read them first.
 My heart tripped at the sound of cracking tinder beneath boot across the clearing.
 The fire had burned out, but the ashes were plenty evidence I’d been here.
 I ducked under the cover of a large spruce and watched.
 Chevelle walked through the tree line and my jaw clenched tight against a silent curse.
 He was alone.
 He kept walking as he looked my direction, surveying the damage from the fire.
 I was convinced he would know it had been me, but he didn’t stop or even slow.
 It made no sense.

 And Marie deserves the best."
 "Are you referring to the ring or yourself?
 No, no--just a joke, son."

I tried to slow my horse but no longer had control of him.
 “Again,” Chevelle warned.
 The rock was coming for me a second time.
 I tried to duck out of the way but the wall was there once more, blocking me from moving.
 I cursed as the stone glanced off my cheek.
 “This isn’t fair,” I complained.
 It seemed he was holding me in place just to strike me.
 “It’s the only way, Freya.
 This is for your protection.” “I highly doubt they will pummel my face with rocks,” I spat out.
 “No,” he said, “they will bind you and burn you alive.” I felt sick.

 a secret?
 Something personal?"
 He gazed at her, intrigued.
 "What is it?"
 She dropped her own gaze.
 "The reason I like dancing so much is that I like you to hold me."
 He smiled at the pretty rosiness in her cheeks.
 Taking her hand, he leaned close to whisper, "One day--one day soon--I plan to arrange things so that I can hold you all night long."
 Her blush deepened.

And don’t forget that Pig Latin and Klingon don’t count real languages.
 When he does say something it’s usually so pointless and offensive that any chicks who might have managed to overlook his bizarre hair and lack of physical mass would be so insulted that they would probably try to kill the annoying little bastard.
 Jim – Don’t even compare Batman to Sumo Assassin!
 Batman is a weakling in a stupid costume with some gizmos, without his gizmos he’s just a loser in tights.
 All Sumo Assassin has to protect him from his enemies are, his Sumo Loin Cloth, and his Sumo Fighting Skills.
 They’re all he needs.
 Hell the loincloth isn’t even bullet proof.
 On top of that the Sumo-mobile can outrun the Bat-mobile any day of the week, not to mention the fact that its solar powered so its earth friendly.

 Oh yeah that’s right, he can eat all he wants and not gain a pound.

It'd be all too easy to slip into the same kind of numbness now as a refuge against everything.
 What would happen if I failed to surface?
 It'd been easier to lapse into catatonia this time than last.
 Would I reach a point where I couldn't come back?
 There'd been a time right after the accident where Mom had thought I was already there.
 I was just numb enough still to think about such things without immediately collapsing.
 Even so, I felt a pang of dizziness as my mind warned me I'd pushed it too far today.
 I found myself in the kitchen, nearly finished making enchiladas with only vague ideas of why I'd started pulling ingredients out of the fridge.
 I wasn't hungry.
 I knew I should eat something, but that hardly merited putting together anything more complicated than a sandwich.

"Is this because of earlier?
 Because I told you I don't expect you to stay with me?"
 Apparently it was his turn to spend some time pondering his reply.
 My six-legged friend was joined by another of his kind, and they were manfully working their way up the hill towards a tree.
 "I've actually wanted to ask you for quite a while.
 Hearing that Brandon was taking you was harder for me to accept than you might imagine.
 My asking you now has nothing to do with our conversation from earlier today."
 "Why are you doing it now then?
 I half expected you to try and send me out of the country again.
 An invitation to the local equivalent to Prom was the last thing on my mind."

 ."
 She blushed just thinking about how they made her feel.
 He kissed her lips softly.
 "Do you know what my life was like before you came?
 I'd dated half the women in Boston, I think, trying to find one that I wanted to spend my life with.
 I was really lonely, but I'd just about given up.
 It just wasn't worth the effort."
 He squeezed her hands.
 "And then you walked into my garden.

“The elders are in an uproar.” I didn’t question any further.
 Town trouble was usually of no interest to me.
 Actually, I couldn’t think of the last time the town had had trouble… She huffed and I knew it was best to indulge her.
 “What sort of trouble?” “Apparently, Evelyn of Rothegarr came into town from the meadows at full speed wheezing and sneezing.
 She reached the village center, grabbed her throat, and fell to the ground without a breath.
 Dying.” I stopped chewing, my mouth gone dry.
 Fannie continued, “They found a common thistle caught in her airway.” My stomach curled into knots.
 I whispered, “A thistle?” “Mmm.
 Council thinks she must have been working a spell that went awry.” Fannie peered at me; I might have turned pale.
 She threw the cork at me.

Johnny – What a stupid way to pose the question.
 Eugene – Life.
 For myself, I prefer life.
 For others, I prefer choice.
 Johnny – What does that mean?
 Eugene – I choose to live, but I leave it to other people to make their own choices.
 I don’t want to make their decisions for them.
 Jim – What does that have to do with anything?
 We’re talking about personal preference and you’re trying to move it up into the realm of philosophy.
 Eugene – I just thought it sounded good.

The preference for authoritarian rule was often justified by the need for rapid economic development, which could be impeded by opposition to government policies and by the need to contain regional and tribal conflicts.
 Neither of these claims has proven true.
 Living standards have actually declined in most African countries during the last two decades.
 Regional and tribal politics have flourished.
 Dozens of civil and inter-state wars have been fought, accounting for millions of lost lives.
 Food production and employment have lagged far behind population growth.
 In the absence of legal channels of protest, opposition parties have frequently resorted to violence.
 By the end of the 1980s the lack of material progress and the emergence of young educated professionals in leadership positions had fostered, on the one hand, a revolt against single-party rule and, on the other, popular pressure for multi-party democracy that have together resulted in a democratic domino effect, similar to the spread of communist rule which Western democracies had feared would overwhelm South Asia twenty years ago.
 As recently as 1989, only four African countries could be considered stable democracies and three more were moving in that direction.
 Only three years later, 18 African nations could be classified as democratic and a number of others were in the midst of far-reaching political change.

"No."
 Marie shook her head.
 "I'm not going to marry him."
 "What?!"
 "I don't love him, Mother.
 I never did, really."
 She turned to look at her mother earnestly.
 "When you love someone, you should feel comfortable with him all the time.
 You should be able to put your arms around him whenever you want without having to fear rejection or disapproval.
 You should feel secure enough with him to know that no mistake you might make will make him stop loving you.

I stretched out on the ground to eat, examining the carved medallion clasped to my boot.
 Chevelle stepped away again, disappearing behind the rocks that had become more jagged and taller along our way.
 When he returned, the sight of him stole my breath.
 His worn traveling clothes were gone, exchanged for dark gray and black, a leather vest covering his shirt, the laces loose at his chest.
 A long, dark cloak was clasped at his shoulders, the material thick and coarse, so unlike the soft robes the rest of council wore.
 I knew I was gaping at him, but there was something so strange about it.
 He caught my eye and I let my gaze fall to his sword belt, struggling to gather my composure.
 I had to remind myself that he despised me.
 By late afternoon, our path opened to look down on the village nestled in the rocks of a narrow valley ahead.
 Chevelle stopped on a ridge to allow us a better view.

The officers move into place for the bust.
 Several marked police cars hide in an adjacent apartment complex that has a driveway into the grocery store parking lot at the opposite end of the shopping center.
 I am instructed to park my truck’s front end against a fence that borders the parking lot facing the greenbelt.
 I am shown new surveillance photos of the two suspects and their vehicle: a red Dodge Charger with tinted windows.
 The code word which I am to use in a sentence to confirm the exchange of money for drugs has been changed to “Reno” and I see a pattern so I assume that if the deal does not go down this time, my next code word may be “Vegas.” I pray there isn’t a next time.
 Chapter 20: Going Down Finally a red Dodge Charger is driving slowly over the entrance bridge.
 I say, “Red Dodge Charger approaching at one o’clock,” attempting not to move my lips, as the vehicle is coming almost directly towards me on my right.
 The Dodge slows almost to a stop just a couple of car lengths away.
 I am unable to see in the tinted windows of the car but I am certain they can see me; I stare back as if to say, “Is that you?” They are obviously aware that I am there, alone and awaiting their arrival.
 The car slowly pulls away after taking a good look at me.

He turned, tossing the cloak aside as he propped one leg onto a rock.
 I had the strangest notion he was posing.
 He scrutinized me, and I resisted the urge to straighten my hair and brush the dirt from my clothes.
 “Don’t be shy.” The stranger beckoned, gesturing to an upturned log beside the fire.
 The meat sizzled and popped as I crossed to him and sat obediently.
 It was too late to hide; I might as well at least have something decent to eat.
 Its smell was unfamiliar, but I didn’t care.
 It smelled like food.
 He reached down and tore a hunk from the spit, tossing it to me with a wink.
 When I blushed, he smiled a wicked smile.

I expected Rachel to back down as soon as she realized he was spoiling for a fight, but if anything she looked more determined.
 It was hard to believe this was the same person I'd had to rescue from Cassie so recently.
 I stopped Rachel just before she could put the impressive lungful of air she'd just taken in to whatever use she'd planned.
 "It's okay.
 I'm better.
 The lane's dusty and exercise would do me good."
 She hesitated, obviously torn, but my fumbling fingers finally found the unfamiliar door release and I made the decision for her.
 I swung the door open and slipped out of the car before she could respond.
 I waved goodbye with a cheery casualness I thought did a pretty good job of hiding my desire to break into tears.
 It was amazing how I'd let the numbness slip away for nothing.

I am the hilt, and my apprentice is the blade.
 But you…”
 Again that greedy look.
 “You are extraordinary.
 I do not have to give you unearned power.
 I must simply guide and instruct.” Velixar stood, and when his power flared, Qurrah fell to his knees and worshipped his new master.
 “You are what I have searched for all these years.
 You and I will destroy this world side by side.
 We will lay waste to all life and put absolute order upon every last soul.”
 “Teach me,” Qurrah said, his mouth buried into the dirt.

No mess, no pain, and no hurt feelings.
 Jim – I’ve tried that, didn’t work.
 Liz – You could just pretend to be stomach-ache then.
 Jim – Tried that too, did you know that your mother carries around a bottle of stomach tonic with he in her purse?
 Liz – Well there has to be a better answer than stabbing yourself.
 Jim – Maybe, but having someone call in a bomb-threat won’t work every time.
 Liz – Very funny Jim.
 Jim – I’m serious, Gene and I talked the whole scenario over for days, stabbing myself is the best way to get away from your mom, and by best I mean the way I spend the least time in jail.
 Liz – You brought Gene into this before you talked to me about it?
 Wait, does she hit on Gene too?

I mustered a half-hearted grin and followed Britney out into the hall.
 "She's a complete monster.
 None of the other teachers are nearly as strict as Campbell.
 Making you catch up on all that homework is ridiculous."
 My silence seemed to leave my new friend at a loss for words.
 I guess she was used to people agreeing with everything she said.
 I didn't like to lie though, so when I didn't agree with someone I tended not to say anything.
 I guess I didn't think my new task was as unreasonable as it'd first appeared?
 "On the plus side, at least we'll both be at the math lab together.
 I've had to spend an hour there every evening since Dad found out I had the class low on the first test.

Not that I could have pulled off the intricate braiding and designs of the other elves.
 But my ears were clearly more rounded than everyone else’s, almost blunt.
 Ruby’s were different, too.
 Hers were more angular though, long and almost pointed at the tip.
 Neither of us matched the norm.
 Hers were one extreme, mine the other.
 She turned to look at me.
 “Feeling okay?” I remembered I was going to ask her something.
 I said, “Mm-hmm,” and got lost in the hum of my reply.
 She smiled at my satisfied trance.

In sub-Saharan Africa, gross primary enrolment will have to double before year 2000 to achieve this goal.
 In addition to the quantitative deficiency in educational enrolment and achievements, the quality of teaching facilities, materials and staff is severely deficient in many countries.
 Most developing countries hire teachers with only a secondary school certificate and a minimum of teachers’ training.
 This contributes to the high rate of primary school drop-outs and grade repetition.
 Only 71 per cent of first-grade entrants complete primary school in developing countries.
 Addressing these challenges will require a substantial increase in financial resources devoted to education.
 In most regions, public expenditure on education has risen in recent years.
 In 1990, the world average was 13.5 per cent of total government expenditure, or 4.8 per cent of GNP.
 More than one-third of the countries in the world still spend more on the military than on education.
 Efforts to improve education must go hand in hand with efforts to promote peace and disarmament and drastically curtail military spending.

It also could have been that I knew where they had fallen from the day before.
 Regardless, I made my way over and took a few volumes and scrolls back to my secluded table.
 I was able to find several documents on the northern clans and even one of the missing pages of names—L.
 I had spread them out on the table and was studiously examining them when a shadow crossed my desk.
 I realized someone was standing there and distractedly glanced up to see who.
 My instinct to breathe deserted me.
 It was Chevelle Vattier.
 Chapter Three Black Roots
 Chevelle stood there, staring down at me, as I leaned halfway across the table of documents concerning the northern clans.
 Researching him.

If he gripped any harder, I was afraid he would snap his fingers off.
 And, me?
 I pulled an arrow out faster than you could say oh-my-god-there’s-a-hideous-monster-coming-to-whip-our-butts.
 And then I launched it.
 The arrow shot at Kojas, speeding through the air.
 But what did Kojas do?
 He whipped out his sword and slashed the arrow in half right before it hit him.
 The pieces fell on the ground.
 Holy tamale.
 I stared at the cracked pieces of my arrow and my flare of determination went out with a poof.

But this cannot be accomplished by sweeping remedies or hastened by over-eagerness or impatience.
 It will require application of a profound understanding of the process of development and transition.
 We believe that a properly conceived effort to draw on the best available knowledge and experience of other countries can generate a transition strategy that avoids the dangers and pitfalls of the initial approach to reform and puts in place the essential foundations for the new system to function effectively and generate benefits for the people before the dawn of the new century.
 In the preceding chapters we have tried to draw attention to the uncommon opportunities that the world presents at the dawn of a new millennium for the abolition of war and the eradication of poverty.
 None will question the desirability of achieving peace, democratic freedoms and prosperity for all.
 But many may doubt the practical feasibility of accomplishing these necessary goals.
 Every great endeavour requires a proportionate investment of energy and resources for its accomplishment.
 The realization of peace and prosperity is no exception.
 What, then, are the resources required for this achievement and where are we to find them?
 The history of civilization is the process of humankind discovering greater and greater resources and learning how to utilize them to acquire higher and higher levels of physical security, productive power and comfort.

When are you going to break the news?
 Jim – Later tonight I think, probably going to be me and dad doing it.
 I think I’ll put it off as long as I can.
 Liz – I think I would get it out of the way as quickly as possible.
 Jim – On another day I might do that, but not today.
 I think I’ll go and get something to eat first.
 Every condemned man should get a last meal before being executed.
 Liz – That sounds like a good idea too.
 Jim – I haven’t eaten in hours.
 Liz – Neither have I, not since before the show, too nervous.

Maybe you should flunk a test or two.
 Only it doesn't really count unless your dad, you know, the one who used to make your birthdays really special, is gone."
 Alec's mouth opened, closed, and then assumed its normal place in his unreadable mask.
 He reached out, almost consolingly, but I stepped away before he could make contact.
 I knew I should shut up before I said something really unreasonable, but my anger was in the driver's seat now.
 "Don't try and pretend you're sorry.
 You were just looking for an excuse to get out of class once all of the hero worship dried up.
 Well I got you out and you helped me avoid all of the stupid questions everyone would've asked, so we're even."
 There was another flicker of something I couldn't quite read in Alec's eyes, but I was long past caring.
 I turned and limped off, wishing my ankle was in better shape so I could properly stomp.

Sleep came to him almost instantly.
 In Rodregas’ life he had experienced several very unpleasant ways of waking up, but this was the worst: a searing hot pain stabbed into his stomach!
 He reared up from his mat, but he felt hands holding him down onto the mattress.
 It was dark, but he could see in the dim light of the moon that someone was shoving a knife into his belly.
 He knew that in the next couple of seconds, his actions would decide his fate.
 He was bleeding, so he would be losing strength as well.
 Whoever his assailants were, they had him trapped.
 Rodregas violently kicked out with one leg, but his stabbing attacker avoided the blow.
 He did let up on the knife for a second though.
 Instead of following up, Rodregas used the momentum of his kick to swing his body sideways.

I wish we could do something.“ Rodregas nodded his understanding and said, “I wish we could, but the three of us against a score, the chances of our success is far smaller than the chances of our death.” He stated in the ‘matter of fact’ sergeant voice that he knew people would follow.
 Rodregas stood up and started to turn, but while Doi’van stood he faced the road and he said, “I have been on this road before, though I did not know then that it was called ‘The Princess Road.’ To me it was a road of sorrow.” Doi’van was using that flat voice that he used when stating facts.
 “Rodregas, you said our odds are bad, but how long shall we wait for the odds to be good?” Doi’van’s voice dropped the flat tone and started to sound like rocks groaning deep in the earth, as if a great earthquake was coming, “You believe that a god of the Celestials is behind your survival and that this god wants to see us fight the Immortalists.
 I spent two years of my life in the Menagerie, I swore to myself that given a chance I would see no others be enslaved by the Lord Taiga.” Doi’van continued speaking with the same tone as if the earth shook, “I know these caravans.
 The guards will be mostly badly trained human scum armed in leather and with weapons of simple steel.
 The Immortalist scouts are another matter.
 They will be highly trained but still the lowest of the Immortal Guards, mostly with just one or two of the lesser sigils such as strength or one that gives him enhanced senses.
 Against the three of us, a Forest Nymph with a powerful Black Yew bow and a Hellborn Prince of the Orqui and a warrior empowered with a Celestial Lion, are the odds truly that bad?” Rodregas stood still, surprised by Doi’van’s words.
 In truth he did not know how good or bad their odds were.
 He knew they were not good, but his mind did not spin with the odds.

The results of her efforts on Rachel's behalf were nothing less than spectacular, and the casual-looking knot of curls and twists was wispy in all the right places.
 Even with Rachel currently an order of magnitude hotter than normal, Jasmin still captured the prize.
 Rachel's work on her behalf had resulted in a makeup job that was so incredibly understated, even us girls had a hard time detecting it.
 Her wavy brunette hair had been straightened and pulled back in what looked like an attempt to let some other girls shine for a change, but it just made her look like a goddess who'd decided to spend the night slumming.
 Given who she'd spent the last hour being surrounded by, it was no wonder Dominic was worried she was the ugly step sister.
 She needn't have worried.
 Her features were even more exotic than Jasmin's, and Rachel had chosen bright colors that made her stand out much more than usual.
 James' macho cool really was going to finally crack tonight.
 Maybe I could pull the dress off after all.
 Everyone would be so busy looking at the other three girls that they wouldn't even notice me.

Rick took the bottle.
 "I'll rub some on your back."
 "Oh."
 She hadn't even thought about that.
 He rubbed lotion into her smooth, flawless skin.
 She was so small that when he used both hands, they almost completely covered her back.
 He liked touching her, and he spent so much time rubbing her back that he was afraid she was growing suspicious.
 But she hadn't uttered a single word.
 Dropping a light kiss on her shoulder, he moved away.
 Marie felt drowsy with pleasure and wished he hadn't stopped.

“We're part of Kojas' personal guard.
 We were sent to look for you half-lings.” “Well I want you to know something,” I said and got closer to his face.
 “We will win this fight, mark my words.
 Kojas is going down, way down if you know what I mean.” “Well,” he said, “if you let me go I'll give him your message.” “I don't think so,” I whispered.
 “You can tell him when he joins you.” I rammed my knife into his stomach and pulled it out.
 The faery's eyes rolled upward and he went still.
 I wiped my knife on my pants and sheathed it.
 I ran over to Jason, who was crouched over the unconscious Seth.
 Jason looked up and I saw his face was full of concern.
 “Can you help Emily, she's trying to release the trapped dragon,” I whispered to him.

Eugene – I don’t want to talk about it.
 Liz – Did they beat you up?
 Jim – I have a picture in my mind of a little Japanese girl kicking you in the shins.
 How accurate is it?
 Eugene – They didn’t beat me up.
 Liz – Well what happened then?
 Eugene – You’re never going to let me live this down.
 Jim – Probably not.
 Specially not if you got beaten up by a bus-load of Japanese school girls.
 Eugene – I didn’t get beaten up.

But I threw a few kicks.
 Either they accomplished my intention or Tony or someone pulled the Polish guy off me.
 Then the others followed.
 I heaved myself up and made for the door.
 Outside, with the temperature something below zero, I trudged and slid up the sidewalk the few blocks to Tony’s place.
 His mom had given me a key.
 No one was home.
 In my previous life, with a few brief exceptions, I had avoided fistfights by using my size (I grew up fast) and a rather savage look I could muster.
 So I hadn’t known murderous rage.
 It felt righteous, as if revenge weren’t only a need but an act of justice, without which I could no longer live.

Shame followed the couple wherever they went.
 Thomas Richard was born on a cold December day to parents who were children themselves.
 I followed just 13 months later, and another brother was born 14 months later and died almost immediately after his birth.
 My mother at 20 years old had two toddlers and had to accept the death of her third baby.
 Years later, I returned to this town and located the home we first shared.
 The home, which had since been converted into a one car garage, still had the old front door located next to a single car garage door that had been put in place of what was once the front window.
 It seemed impossible that it could have ever have been anything but a garage.
 Chapter 3: The Set Up The lights of another car coming over the bridge do not belong to either vehicle I am expecting, so I examine the occupants.
 It is a man and his wife about my age so I look away quickly as to not draw attention to myself.
 I know I’ve got to wait patiently, as this drug deal is important to me and my family.

She'd taken off her engagement ring yesterday before they'd left for the shore, and she hadn't put it back on last night.
 She wasn't wearing it this morning, either.
 He wondered if she realized it but decided not to ask her.
 Setting his cup down, he said, "How would you like another new experience?"
 She smiled in delight.
 "What?"
 "Washing my car."
 Her face fell.
 "I could do that in 1927."
 "But have you?"

Rodregas swung his shield aggressively, he hit the man’s sword with his shield and then banged the other man’s shield hard.
 Rodregas’ goal was to see if he could out muscle the man while staying protected by the shield.
 It worked!
 Clearly his opponent, though set for a heavy blow, was not expecting the strength of Rodregas’ bash.
 Still his opponent was too good to fall, even when surprised.
 And even as he half fell backwards he used the momentum to slide down and try to land a blow low under the shield.
 Rodregas had both quickness and strength on his side.
 He blocked the blow with his sword and then bashed down quick and hard multiple times with his shield.
 He thought he heard a bone break.
 Rodregas paused and the knight signaled him as victor with a finger to the Heavens.

He would give her no chance to strike.
 A blade stabbed his side.
 Velixar whirled, his speed far beyond any mortal.
 He stepped past Felewen’s slash and slammed a hand against her chest.
 Dark magic poured in.
 Her arms and legs arched backward, her sword fell from her hand, and her mouth opened in a single, aching shriek.
 Bits of darkness flared from her mouth, her eyes, and her nostrils.
 Done, Velixar shoved her smoking body back into the alley and left her to die.
 When he turned, he snarled.
 Aurelia was gone.

“Many are dying,” Felewen said.
 “The humans have a spellcaster of their own who repelled our ambush.”
 Aurelia nodded.
 She knew something had gone wrong; otherwise, the battle would have been over in seconds.
 “Very well,” Aurelia said.
 “Will you accompany me?”
 Felewen smiled at her.
 She drew her longsword and saluted.
 “But of course, Lady Thyne,” she said with none-too-subtle sarcasm.
 Aurelia tried to return a smile.

 I might see some lint on your shirt that needed to be brushed off.
 Like this."
 He turned to face her and reached behind her to brush off the imaginary lint, his arm drawing her close.
 Marie laughed.
 "I think there's lint a little lower on my back."
 Reaching lower meant he had to draw her closer.
 "Hmmm--there's a piece at the top too."

 Art – One with a narrow range of study, limited to one subject.
 But it’s better than what you have.
 What do you think you’ll do about Liz.

We supposed Tom had stolen the crowbar and sold it to another camper then bummed a ride home.
 That Sunday morning, on the biggest and flattest of all the canyon’s boulders, Eric stood as though at a pulpit, arms outstretched as in the “Jesus body picture” while he consulted our copy of Zarathustra and recited, “’Man is something that shall be overcome.
 You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm.
 Once you were apes, and even now man is more ape than any ape.
 Whoever is the wisest among you is also a mere conflict and cross between plant and ghost.
 But do I bid you become ghosts or plants?
 Behold, I teach you the overman, the superman!
 The superman is the meaning of the earth.
 Let your will say: the superman shall be the meaning of the earth!
 I beseech you, my brothers, remain faithful to the earth, and do not believe those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes!

Velixar traveled west, following unseen after his two apprentices.
 He would witness their first true test, and he would bask in the bloodshed that was sure to come.
 !
 [section break](break.png)
 The two traveled over the gentle hills, only the rough gasps of Qurrah’s breathing breaking the silence.
 As the two neared the village, Harruq dared to speak.
 “Qurrah,” he asked, “who is this Velixar?”
 “He is a teacher,” the half-orc whispered in between ragged breaths.
 “One wiser than I ever thought possible.”
 “So we’ll do what he says?

Part of that includes making sure other people with substantial resources don't abuse their power."
 It was probably about as good of a chance to find out what was going on under the surface as I was going to get, but something inside me shied away.
 It was like I'd be entering a new world, one in which some of my illusions would be shattered.
 I'd have to face a colder interpretation of certain people's actions.
 Brandon successfully defused any awkwardness, chuckling as he pulled into the school parking lot.
 "You really didn't know any of that?"
 I shook my head, more or less speechless, and he reached out and playfully tapped the side of my face with one finger.
 The touch left my skin warm and tingling.
 "That's what's so amazing about you.
 Almost everyone else at school was born here.

My doubts about the more outlandish stories, those about the obsession with power and ideas of breeding a stronger line, are gone.
 But maybe they were in love.
 Maybe she was impressed by his station, maybe she had her own ambitions.
 Or maybe she lived a nightmare and only hung on so long for her children.
 I was able to piece together some things about her life.
 She didn’t go into much detail about the magic, which I would have found useful, just that she practiced often and was apparently unusually talented.
 But she did tell more about her duties in the castle.
 Her father must have ruled a vast kingdom.
 And she was his second.
 I heard someone in the front room and knew I had read through the night again.

"It depends."
 She dabbed at her lips with her napkin.
 "If you do what you're supposed to do, garden parties and radio and reading and long walks and gossip are the extent of it.
 But if you have a male cousin under your thumb, you go to speakeasies and dance and drink cocktails and meet interesting people."
 "I believe you mentioned last night that you fall into the second category."
 "Of course."
 She smiled.
 "Will you be my 2011 cousin?"
 He laughed.
 "Alcohol is legal now, and women can go anywhere men go."

“To fight the war.
 Celestia may have condemned it to continue forever, but she slumbers now.
 Harnessing enough power, we can defeat the goddess.
 We can bring all of Dezrel under our control and declare victory for Karak.”
 Qurrah stood, his eyes glimmering with anticipation.
 “Where will we strike first?”
 “Woodhaven is a symbol of cooperation between races.
 That must be ended.
 We will burn Veldaren to ash thereafter.
 Once all of Neldar is in chaos, we may proceed however we wish.”

She leaned back and let out a sigh of relief.
 Her legs were killing her but she wasn't going to tell Jason that.
 He got up and sat at the base of the tree.
 “You had to take the good tree?” She motioned around.
 “There are plenty of trees to pick from Jason.
 So pick one.” He mumbled something and closed his eyes.
 Emily shook her head.
 He was too stubborn sometimes.
 Emily stared at the sky and then she knew what he had said.
 She looked down to say something but Jason was fast asleep.

Fear.
 Failure._
 An apparition swirled before him, blacker than the shadows, red eyes smoldering.
 Its rank claws touched his face, turning the sweat on his brow to ice.
 The arrow squirmed deeper.
 Qurrah focused every bit of his will upon it, desperately seeking to repulse it.
 His well of energy, which he’d thought empty, burgeoned and over-flowed.
 The arrow snapped, banishing the necromancer’s presence, but leaving a solitary impression squatting at the back of Qurrah’s mind:
 Curiosity.
 Qurrah opened his eyes.

He finished the spell mere seconds before his mind succumbed to the sleep that crawled at his eyes.
 Even though he was dead, life energy still swirled inside the elf’s body.
 Normally this energy would be consumed by the earth in burial, but Qurrah had other plans.
 His spell took in this life energy through his hand, filling his body with it, healing his wounds and clearing his mind.
 The darkness fighting for control in his head subsided, a shred of strength returning to his limbs.
 There was still the slight problem of the arrow lodged in his throat.
 Qurrah had a solution but it was far from pleasant.
 Most likely he would die, but he had to try.
 He heard no screams coming from around the corner, but he knew that meant nothing.
 He had to believe his brother was still alive.

She nodded and started to turn to go into the garden.
 But Rick caught her hand, stopping her.
 He gazed down at her.
 "I hope you get back, Marie.
 But if you do, I'll miss you."
 Her throat was suddenly sore.
 "I-I think you have some lint on your back."
 She embraced him, whispering, "Thank you for everything.
 I'll miss you too."
 She gave him a smile before turning and walking into the garden.

It's just more dominance games."
 I nodded.
 It made sense, but it was all I could do to keep my eyes grounded despite the cold prickles running up and down my spine.
 Actual conversation was just too much, so I sat quietly with my head slightly bowed while the song ran its course.
 Alec's fingers gently pulled my chin up as the music ended.
 "Dance with me?"
 I mustered a brave smile as I nodded and let him lead me out onto the dance floor.
 It was a slow song this time, and Alec didn't protest when I abandoned all pretense of actual dancing, and just leaned into him hungrily.
 The reassurance I was seeking was weaker than normal.
 The solid feel of his body was just as permanent as always, but there was no tingle where our skin touched.

Harruq chuckled.
 “He was wrong, obviously.
 Qurrah was stuck talking like that.
 Like a snake hiss or a raspy whisper.”
 “Or a dying man,” Aurelia whispered, so soft that Harruq could not make out her words.
 !
 [section break](break.png)
 The streets were all the same to him, so down them all he wandered.
 The image of Aurelia and Harruq danced in his mind, and conflicting feelings rippled through his chest.
 “She seems a kind enough elf,” Qurrah said, talking to himself since he had no company.

His mind had been wandering to the 1920s a lot lately.
 He and Sharon had had a good time at Teri’s dance, and the stereotypical costumes—drop-waist dresses, cloche hats, raccoon coats—had made him wonder what life had been like for Marie Tranton before she’d gotten married.
 Had she gone to lots of dances and parties?
 He wondered what radio programs she’d enjoyed and if maybe she’d preferred to read.
 Sighing, Rick rose to go inside.
 He didn’t feel like being alone all day.
 Maybe he’d call Dirk and go play racquetball.
 Or maybe— He stopped and turned around, hearing footsteps.

We have a more secure location.” I must not have appeared convinced.
 “Please,” he added.
 I sighed.
 What choice did I have?
 And then I laughed, because I couldn’t even trust myself.
 I expected him to look at me like I was mad.
 Instead, he looked like it was… endearing.
 He stood and walked over to me, taking my hand to help me up.
 When he touched me, I tried to fight the heat that ran up my neck.
 I couldn’t and embarrassment caused my cheeks to color as well.

“Of course, what could one expect from Celestia’s cursed?”
 “We are not thieves, Ahrqur Tun’del,” Qurrah said.
 “We are assassins.” The whip writhed around his arm, begging for use.
 “Arrogant ones at that,” said the elf.
 “Such a claim is foolish.
 If you were assassins, you would strike without chatter.
 You are nothing but pretenders.”
 Harruq clanged his swords together, showering the ground with sparks.
 His armor shimmered as his anger grew.
 “Pretenders with wonderful toys,” the elf continued, eyeing Harruq’s blades.

At first it seemed like things changed up on a daily basis.
 Then Jasmin manifested her royal wolf form and things settled down a little."
 We were venturing into unknown territory for me.
 Alec was usually so careful to keep me sheltered from his world.
 "Was Jasmin dominant then?
 I mean if she was a royal wolf and you hadn't manifested your hybrid form yet did she win all of the fights?"
 Alec rested his cheek on the top of my head.
 "Not exactly.
 If she'd been a little more heartless she probably could have killed me and cowed the rest of the pack.
 Even then though, it was becoming pretty clear that we couldn't have two separate packs in such close proximity.

CHAPTER ELEVEN
 "I like the white one.
 It really shows off your tan."
 Rick watched as Marie turned in front of the mirror, inspecting the white sundress.
 She looked sweet and sexy at the same time.
 "But I don't have any shoes to wear with it."
 "We'll buy you some."
 She'd been so depressed the day after their conversation about lovemaking that he'd told her they'd go shopping tonight and to the beach tomorrow--and even Sunday, if the sunscreen worked.
 She went to him, looping her arms about his neck.
 "Thank you," she said, raising her lips to his.

Sometimes I entered a Zen-like state where everything else in the world just dropped away.
 It was nice to know the accident hadn't changed that at least.
 My heart stuttered a little, but I wrenched my thoughts away from where they'd been headed, distracting myself by wondering where Mom was.
 She'd been a little flighty before, but now it wasn't uncommon for her to be gone for twenty-four hours at a stretch.
 In some ways it was hard not having her around, but in other ways it was a relief.
 Sometimes she reminded me too much of Dad and Cindi.
 A surge of guilt splashed around inside me at the thought, but it was a realization I'd made weeks ago.
 By now some of the sharper edges to the emotion had worn away.
 I shrugged, dropping my book and binder on the floor next to my bed.
 Dwelling on the guilt would just make me think about why I felt guilty in the first place.

I did talk to my mother the next morning and told her that I had met the woman I was going to marry—and it wasn’t either of the two brunettes in my bed.
 Gimme a break, it was the eighties!
 The bartender made a call for me to his girlfriend in an attempt to get my dream girl’s number.
 I knew it wouldn’t be easy because as it turns out she knew of me through high school and my reputation preceded me.
 Would this “good girl” give her number to a “bad boy?” The ploy worked and somehow Lisa agreed to let me call her.
 Lisa had been dating a guy for years and I knew of him.
 He had attended our high school and he was the quarterback of the football team (my polar opposite).
 She had only come to the club the night I met her because she was angry with her boyfriend because he choose to spend Valentine’s Day with his brother playing basketball (take notes boys).
 She had called a friend who told her she could get her into this bar because she knew the bartender and they were both under legal drinking age.
 Lisa was 20.

“We’re eating fancy tonight,” Harruq said, tossing the pot back to its corner.
 His stomach growled as the aroma of cooked meat filled his nostrils.
 “Glad you approve,” Qurrah said.
 They ate in silence until only bones remained, which Qurrah then tucked away in a pouch.
 Harruq relaxed and enjoyed the heat while his brother tightened his robe and leaned toward the fire.
 “Things are more dangerous now, aren’t they?” Harruq asked after a pause.
 Qurrah nodded, his thoughts distant.
 “They’re ready for us.
 Many elves will be lurking inside the woods as they hunt for the Forest Butcher.” Again Qurrah chuckled at the name his brother had earned.
 “Will we stop for a while?” Harruq asked.

They're all monsters, but you aren't."
 Alec finally let his eyes fully meet mine.
 "How can you know that when sometimes I'm not sure myself?"
 Almost without realizing it, I moved my hand from his arm to his stomach, and then wrapped both arms around him and pressed my face into his rock-hard chest.
 "Thank you for saving my life.
 Were those wolves some of Brandon's friends?"
 I felt him nod.
 "Simon and Nathanial."
 "I didn't know them that well, they mostly ignored me, but I didn't think they'd kill me."
 Alec finally put his arms around me.

I was simply enveloped in tranquility.
 “Ruby…” Her curls had tumbled back and my complaint fell short as I was distracted by her ears.
 “Hmm?” she answered.
 I reached up to feel my own ears as I considered hers.
 I had always hidden mine behind hair, never braiding it back or putting it up to expose them.
 Not that I could have pulled off the intricate braiding and designs of the other elves.
 But my ears were clearly more rounded than everyone else’s, almost blunt.
 Ruby’s were different, too.
 Hers were more angular though, long and almost pointed at the tip.
 Neither of us matched the norm.

In past centuries cultural values were handed down to future generations through the family.
 Education, which now focuses on the transfer of information, ideas and mental skills, can also impart development-oriented values such as open-mindedness, initiative and innovation.
 Integration and tolerance of diversity are crucial values for the further development of the human community.
 Yet the increasing speed of globalization has accentuated a contrary tendency toward increasing fragmentation.
 The pull of fragmentation cannot be countered solely at the political level.
 Education – both formal and public – is the best means for rapidly communicating and imparting the benefits of integration to the largest numbers of people.
 In order fully to harness cultural potentials for development, we need to understand better the natural process of value formation in society, to discover the circumstances and conditions under which new values are accepted, and the factors that retard or facilitate this process.
 In other words, we need to evolve a theory of value formation which will ultimately enable us to consciously identify and instil values that are most conducive and supportive of a peaceful, prosperous life for all humanity.
 The collective progress of humankind will achieve its maximum velocity when we have discovered how to consciously accelerate the process of values acquisition.
 The role of the UNESCO Commission on Culture and Development can make a valuable contribution to our understanding of this most important issue.

In the evenings they'd eat and talk and watch TV, but he promised to take her to the shore Saturday.
 "The first thing we have to do is buy you a bathing suit," Rick told Marie as they strolled through the mall after dinner Friday evening.
 "Be prepared, OK?
 I think you'll find them a little immodest."
 She tried to prepare herself, but she was shocked by the outfits she was shown.
 The material was thin, and they all had plunging necklines, and some were cut so that the edge of the leg hole was almost as high as the arm hole.
 But she managed to find two, one red and one black with pink flowers, that were less shocking than the others and took them to the dressing room.
 These weren't going to work.
 She'd chosen the two with the least amount of décolletage, and they still wouldn't work.
 They wouldn't completely hide her chest binding.

Rachel turned to me as I suppressed a stab of jealousy.
 "I swear she's going to explode if Ben doesn't show up.
 Considering that dances are about the last place he'd ever go of his own free will, I think the odds are better than even that she'll leave little pieces of herself all over the park before the night is over."
 The revelation was like being hit by a Volvo.
 Somehow I'd assumed that all of the things Brandon had told me were lies.
 "Wait, she really does like Ben?
 I mean Brandon said she did, but I just assumed it was a lie like everything else he told me."
 Rachel patted my hand.
 "Brandon's lies are so convincing precisely because he's so careful to mix a healthy serving of truth in there to go along with the false.
 She's liked Ben for almost as long as I can remember.

You know, to better understand God through all kinds of means.
 Intellect and others.
 I mean, I’m all for preachers showing how Biblical advise can help us be nicer, more prosperous, more benevolent, more likely to work toward human rights and all.
 But without the honest search for connection with the Holy Spirit, none of that good advice carries much weight.”
 Eric vs. Max Von Sydow
 Back on the road my thoughts pick up where they left off in San Luis Obispo, and I wonder if Brother Lawrence perceived his constant companion as the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit.
 Maybe my problem with adoring God is my habit of looking at, or for, God the Father, who in my vocabulary is easy to respect, admire, stand in awe of, or even worship, but is hard for me to adore.
 God, to me, looks more like a vapor.
 And his whispering voice either sounds too much like my own to be surely authentic, or else it’s so soft, I’m not often sure I heard right.
 The Jesus I used to picture looked like a young Max Von Sydow in The Greatest Story Ever Told, and his expressions appeared more posed or acted than honestly human.

Vincent attacked with renewed strength at the promise of reinforcements.
 I was bleeding in a dozen places now, but the rage insulated me from pain and weakness.
 Both sides of my nature were united in hating Vincent.
 If I ever did manage to kill him, my questionable humanity wouldn't grieve.
 The world would be better for his absence.
 I could hear the other pack now, panting with exertion, our friends hot on their heels.
 Vincent overreached in his effort to claim the kill, and I sunk my teeth into the muscled flesh of his shoulder as I finally made it around behind him.
 My claws sank into his arms and legs as I repositioned to snap his neck, and then a hammer blow of weight struck me across the shoulders.
 Knocked loose from Vincent, I spun around in time to tear Simon from the air as he leaped at me again.
 It was the perfect opportunity to end a life nearly as evil as Vincent's, but one of the recent arrivals had bowled Jasmin over.

We’re to rid scum from the city, elven scum.
 You know what I think?
 I think elves can look like anything.
 They’re devious little pricks like that, and you two seem rather ugly and devious, don’t you all agree?”
 The other guards laughed and shouted in agreement.
 They had spread out, flanking the half-orcs on all sides.
 The leader stepped forward and gestured with his weapon.
 “You know what this is?
 This detects elves, and every elf I find I get to politely escort out of the city.
 Oh, and their possessions, well, obviously they were stolen.

The affirmation of democratic principles cannot and will not stop with the domestic governance of member countries.
 It is inevitable that the same principles be extended to the relationships between the nations that make up the international community.
 The present structure of the UN system is a product of the Second World War, just as the League of Nations was of the First.
 The Allied powers conceived it at the height of the war and evolved its structure to reflect the immediate post-war realities.
 Russia, the USA, France and the UK emerged from the war as the arbiters of the world order.
 The defeated Axis powers, Germany and Japan, were relegated to the back ground.
 Mainland China had become communist and was therefore excluded from the power structure.
 India and the other colonies had not yet gained their freedom.
 In recognition of the mutual suspicions between Russia and the Western powers, the rule of unanimity usually adopted by political conferences was applied to decisions made by the five major powers that became the permanent members of the Security Council.
 The rest of the world was poorly represented.

Perhaps all this worrying is for nothing or perhaps the worst is about to happen.
 I must cleanse my mind of this sudden bombardment of thoughts and I must focus!
 I pull into the parking lot of the Starbucks just as my crack-berry rings.
 I see Ashley standing inside the coffee shop with her cell phone up to her ear.
 I answer the phone as I notice a space directly facing the front door of Starbucks is opening up as a car begins to back out.
 She asks me where I am and I tell her I am looking at her from in the truck waiting for that front spot to open.
 She sees me, and as we talk I can see her lips move slightly ahead of the sound of her voice.
 I didn’t see the red Dodge Charger anywhere when I was pulling in and I don’t see it now.
 I scan the people around Ashley as I am pulling forward but Steve, the young man in the surveillance photo, the boyfriend and drug dealer is nowhere to be seen.
 What I can’t see worries me more than what I can as I scan my surroundings.

He repeated many of the apologies’ that he had confessed during his many candid phone calls.
 He looked at his little brother Bryce and apologized for disappointing him and endangering him.
 He said he was sorry for introducing him to pot so many years before.
 He asked for his forgiveness and thanked him for his help and encouragement to get through this program.
 He looked at my mother, his grandmother “Grammy” and apologized for putting her through the same nightmare a second time, as she had been through this with my older brother, Thomas.
 He looked at Uncle Thomas and thanked him for getting him into a program that saved his life.
 He thanked staff members and students by name, as he looked them directly in the eyes.
 He made amends to all of us and he unsuccessfully tried to fight back the tears as he continued.
 He spoke candidly about all of the lessons he had learned to help him deal with a life without the need for drugs.
 He talked about how he had learned to deal with the nightmares and guilt he once drowned in drugs.

There was no such refuge now.
 For a moment I couldn't think of anything other than how the dark blue of his shirt brought out his tan complexion.
 If his gorgeousness had stopped there, I probably would've been okay, but the little spirits in charge of keeping the universe in equilibrium must've been momentarily busy with something more important.
 The blue buttons that kept his shirt snuggly wrapped around his impressive torso were almost the exact shade of his eyes, which happened to be staring at me with a trace of something different than his normal self-assurance.
 In someone else I would've almost said gratitude, but his manner was too arrogant for that.
 More than anything else, that was what finally shook me from my reverie.
 He was already talking.
 "...wanted to talk to you about what happened today."
 Part of me wanted to wait and see what he was going to say, to lose myself in what was sure to be a very convincing lie designed to make him look good, and me feel like I was on heroin for however long he favored me with his presence.
 Luckily that idealistic, stupid part of me had seen too many girls get used by smooth-talking boys.

I mean, “An idiot reigns in the ancient trees of the night,” or whatever the hell he says.
 Shit.
 What I’m saying, in a song like “Love for Lorelei” or “The Golden Apples of the Song”—new stuff, you haven’t heard it yet-- is that, here are my words, man, here’s my life in words.
 What I’m saying is what I mean.
 If I sing “I love you” over and over, that’s truth, man, that’s where I’m coming from, because I mean it, because I’m singing to Lor, and I love her, there’s no secret to it, there’s no murkiness, no florid touches, it’s just raw, like art should be, raw, simple, full of emotion.
 “I Want to Hold Your Ass While You Move”—I wrote that after a particularly beautiful night of lovemaking.
 I don’t care, you know.
 I don’t care if people think it’s too personal, too open, too—what?—minimal or plain and straightforward.
 I mean, some people don’t like that in their art, they can’t take that.
 It’s like Pop Art, which Lor turned me on to.

He’d volunteered to help council bind me.
 But it didn’t stop the hostile stare I was sending his way.
 Ruby stepped in front of him.
 “I’ll stay with her.” He didn’t reply; he merely turned from her to walk into the haze.
 I was still fuming when she faced me, wearing a self-satisfied smile.
 She practically danced forward to plop down in front of me.
 “I have something for you, Frey.” I simply stared at her.
 She was harder to stay mad at.
 I expected her to be a pain—it wasn’t as difficult to accept she’d kept the truth from me.
 She extracted a small package from beneath her cloak and passed it to me.

I ducked as it slashed my side and I winced.
 My shirt slowly turned blue from the trickling wound.
 Yes, blue, my blood is blue.
 It turned back around and threw its self at me.
 This time I was prepared.
 I pulled out my hunting knife out just as he landed on me.
 He yelped and went limp.
 I pushed him off and grabbed my fallen bow, the familiar feeling of the wood boosting my confidence.
 I turned back around and started back where I left off, but then a body slammed into me.
 I just had enough time to see the thrasher, before the fur and dirt filled my vision.

Marie awoke at dawn the next morning and jumped into her clothes.
 She was halfway down the stairs when she remembered she'd promised Rick that she'd wake him up so that he could stay within earshot of her.
 "Rick," she called, tapping on his door.
 "Rick."
 "Just a minute."
 Seconds later his door opened, and he blinked down at her sleepily.
 "You're already dressed?"
 "Yes."
 He wasn't.
 He had on pajama trousers but no shirt.

Chapter 3
 Sneaking out after hours isn’t easy, especially at Emily’s house.
 Her parents aren’t sound sleepers.
 If we weren’t really careful, they’d wake up and then we’d have some answering to do.
 And I don’t think they’d understand our reason.
 I followed Emily down the stairs, in our pajamas, to the door.
 We were careful not to make a sound but I listened closely to the sound of her dad snoring.
 When the snore rang clearly through the house, I breathed a sigh of relief.
 We threw on our sneakers and snuck out the door.
 The summer night air was cool but a little sticky and clammy, making our bodies feel damp.

She was an elemental fairy and, like me, sported a fine head of red hair.” She ran a hand under the curls for emphasis.
 “She heard a story one day of a mixed-species birth and got it in her head she could breed a more powerful magic.
 Apparently she thought she could control her offspring and use the magic to her advantage… I suppose she thought she could rule the world.” Ruby smirked.
 “She studied various species for a few moons and decided her best chance at conquest was a dark elf.
 She made her way to this very village and happened across my father, poor unsuspecting sap.” Ruby flitted her fingers, glasses and wine served before each of us as she continued.
 “So there he was and she, just a wisp of a woman, flew up to him and blew a little fairy dust… well, you know about that.” I narrowed my eyes at her.
 Ruby grinned.
 “He was putty in her hands.
 It was all over before he even knew her purpose.
 She kept him under her enchantments and lies as long as she could.

“Do you wish to speak with me?” “Yes,” he finally stuttered.
 “Uh… hello.” “I am…” I hesitated, unsure if I should tell him my name; I was on the run, after all.
 I decided on a replacement.
 “Lizzy.” He seemed to like that.
 “I’m Noble.” Now I was confused.
 “You are noble?” He shook his head.
 “Noble is my name.
 Noble Grand.” “That is a large name.
 You are a ruler among your people?” He laughed.
 “No, no.

Did I mind?
 Of course not.
 "That would be really great.
 Thanks for offering."
 Brandon ran one finger down the side of my face, and then leaned back with a smile as I reached for the door.
 It wasn't until I was out of the car that I realized our Jeep was parked in its normal spot off to the side of the house.
 Excited to talk to Mom about her last outing, I waved goodbye to Brandon and hurried to the door.
 Mom hardly even looked up from her laptop as I walked in.
 Whew, no need to go through the third degree about Brandon.
 "Anything promising, Mom?"

I hadn’t put much planning in this, but I was still running on adrenaline.
 I decided the fastest course of action was pecking his eyes out.
 It worked.
 He threw his hands up, covering his face, screaming.
 But he did not attack me.
 As I rose back to find my next target, I saw the wolves.
 They were also not being attacked, fighting with no opposition.
 And then I remembered what Chevelle had said.
 They would not kill the animals.
 As I laughed, the hawk screeched, and Chevelle and Steed glanced up at the sound.

“Brother, how could you?” he asked, dread clutching his throat.
 Elves were running down the alley, yelling in their language.
 Qurrah ducked back around, cursed his brother, and then darted to the nearest home.
 The first one had locks, as did the second, but the third was unbarred.
 He hid inside as the shouts of search parties went rushing past.
 Qurrah climbed the stairs to the second floor, sat down beside a bed, and then in silence pondered his fate now that he was alone.

We settled onto the floor of the small den, our backs against the wall, the rock overhang blocking the light of the moon.
 “That is my flame,” Chevelle said, “try to extinguish it.” And my training began.
 Chapter Nine Ruby
 Early the next morning, even before first light, Chevelle woke me for training.
 Gone were the games we had played.
 These lessons were intense and stressful.
 I’d been unable to generate magic on demand so he’d started lunging at me with weapons, sticks, fire, forcing me to respond to protect myself.
 After each attack, he would come right back at me and if I tried to repeat a tactic for defense, he would overpower my magic and push me to find a new maneuver.
 I was beat, winded, drained.
 “Mount up,” he announced.

I only caught his eyes for a few seconds before he looked away, but even his normally riveting blue eyes couldn't distract me from my inability to identify the look.
 I was used to people disliking me, ignoring me, or even occasionally liking me, but this was the first time I'd met someone who seemed to be still trying to decide what camp to join long past the time when most kids our age would have either made a decision or just decided I was weird and started ignoring me.
 Britney seemed to be getting suspicious that I wasn't really listening, so I had to make a lot of eye contact over the next few minutes.
 When I finally got a chance to look back up, Alec and his friends weren't at their table.
 Cassie caught my eye before I looked down, but she was definitely glaring.
 Not the typical I-hate-you-and-I'm-going-to-do-everything-I-can-to-smear-your-reputation-and-get-you-in-trouble-because-we're-in-high-school-and-that's-all-I can-really-do type glaring.
 Instead her eyes seemed to warn me never to go out alone at night because if she ever found me somewhere without any witnesses, they were going to have to hospitalize me.
 I felt a chill run through me, and dropped my eyes out of involuntary reflex.
 I probably would've started shaking if someone hadn't grabbed my shoulder and startled some kind of twisted cross between a shriek and a gasp out of me.
 I turned to give whoever it was a piece of my mind, but Brandon's laughing gray eyes made the words tangle up before they made it down to my tongue.

While that is what his heart hoped for he was not sure if it was the smartest move.
 When they were working on the tack for the horses, he went ahead and asked.
 “Imeralda, I want to make sure you want to continue with us.
 I mean I love to travel with you, but while Doi’van and I are warriors, when you joined us it was only as a travel companion.
 If you want to stay with the village or stay with Jordaan I will understand.
 You know that by now they will be hunting us, if not because of Ravenhurr’s death, than because of the missing Immortal Guards.” “You know that I probably killed more slavers with the Black Yew bow than either you or Doi’van right?” asked Imeralda with a snort.
 “Your abilities are not of question,” Rodregas responded.
 “Your abilities as a Forest Nymph and as an archer make you a very deadly woman.
 As you gain control over your magical powers you will only become more dangerous.
 The question is whether you want to fight?” Imeralda nodded and she hesitated.

But he was afraid to tell her he’d known of her before she’d walked into the garden.
 What if she thought he’d done something to cause it?
 Marie was growing increasingly frustrated with the books she was reading.
 There were all kinds of theories about how to travel through time, but there was absolutely nothing that could explain how she’d traveled through time.
 She hadn’t gotten in a time machine, hadn’t been near a dead star, hadn’t been thinking about 2011.
 That was another thing—most of the articles talked about traveling back in time, not forward.
 How could she have been thinking about 2011 when she knew nothing about it?
 She picked up a book with a chapter on traveling through time by thought.
 Like most of the others, it was about traveling backwards, so it couldn’t explain how she got here, but now she was trying to travel backwards.
 It said you should surround yourself with objects from the period you wanted to go to and eliminate any evidence of the present and then think about a scene from the period.

The first pages contained a detailed description of the writer, including his lineages and how he’d come upon the information.
 He was apparently a record-keeper for Grand Council and was responsible for copying scrolls and adding new information for each of the northern clans from their various local libraries.
 Some of the information was sketchy: gossip from the neighboring fairy guild about strange activities and reports from travelers about deserted villages.
 Or maybe not deserted.
 One description seemed to imply the village was empty not only of elves, but all evidence it had ever been inhabited.
 There were maps of the mountains and forests, showing each village and town.
 Curved lines of azure cut through the page, rivers and streams, and I had a pang of regret for not studying maps with Junnie.
 The next pages were a copy of the record-keeper’s report to Grand Council about his findings.
 And his conclusion.
 There were definitely missing pages here, but something dreadful had happened for certain.

A glint of pleasure shone in his eyes as he watched his handiwork.
 The nobleman struggled against the ropes, his gaze locked on the sky.
 “Please, no, take it away, I’ll do anything, anything, just keep it away.
 Don’t let it touch me, please, please, DON’T LET IT TOUCH ME!”
 The man screamed for the next two minutes.
 Then he died.
 “What did you do to him?” Harruq asked once the man was dead.
 “Fear is an entertaining weapon, is it not?”
 The warrior shook his head in wonder, but Qurrah said no more.
 “Do we leave the bodies here?” Harruq asked.

The door had a strange mechanism such as Rodregas had never seen before.
 Gorin lifted a large handle and solid squares of iron slid out of the floor and the ceiling.
 When both the top and the bottom fully released the guard pushed the doors wide.
 The three immediately pushed through and Rodregas said, “You can close the doors.
 I will pound on them when we are ready to leave.” And with a nervous nod the doors slid closed behind them.
 As the door closed Gorin hastily added, “Remember not to touch anything until the Grand Marshal is present.” Doi’van nodded at the now closed doors and raised his torch.
 The three gazed around the room in wonderment.
 In response to the torch the room seemed to respond with a vague light of its own, which came from all directions.
 The chamber was large with a tall vaulted ceiling like some temple, but no rows of seats or prayer mats did this temple hold.
 Instead it was filled with beasts; lions and wolves and the great mythical animals of the Celestial Realm.

As it slides from side to side the lighter is moved just ahead of it.
 The pill slowly vaporizes as it is cooked from beneath.
 A thin line of fumes from the pill is released into the air and the addict inhales the vapor through a stem pipe.
 Addicts hardly notice that their fingers and thumbs burn; blisters form where the flame licks back from the bottom of the foil.
 As the pill slides back and forth, it leaves behind a zigzagging black mark resembling a line made by an indelible pen.
 This technique is called “chasing the dragon,” and is reminiscent of a technique for ingesting heroin, Oxy’s unfashionable, yet omnipresent, cousin.
 When addicts become so addicted that they cannot afford the quantity of Oxy they need to satisfy their cravings, as the appetite exceeds the budget, it is time for the next phase of this vicious cycle.
 Addicts will do what they said they would never do.
 Steal money.
 Sell their bodies to strangers.

Chevelle returned quickly with two small, furred animals slung over his back.
 As his gaze reached the log that lay in front of me, it burst into an orange flame, thin branches forming a spit as he skinned and attached the animals.
 The process was so smooth, I couldn’t say exactly what had happened.
 Chevelle was changing.
 Or, more likely, he was becoming more himself.
 He wasn’t as formal.
 He seemed relaxed, and apparently magic, quick and powerful, was intertwined into his every routine.
 He didn’t need to do much by hand; I would have spent hours trying to build a spit and skin an animal.
 An old question came back to me and I asked, “How do you hunt?” “Hmm?” “You don’t have a bow,” I explained.
 “What do you use to hunt?” He hesitated, as if deciding what to tell me.

kidnapped, because of the need to right a world that had without warning gone fantastically awry, because of the need to reassure her parents.
 The change had been so abrupt and surreal.
 But now she knew that she would have adapted.
 She would have married Rick and had children with him and developed the sense of home that she'd missed.
 Marie rocked on her bed, sobbing against her knees.
 Why couldn't she have realized all this before she'd had the opportunity to return?
 She was still in bed, awake but numb, when her mother tapped on her door the next morning.
 "Marie?
 Are you awake?"
 "Yes.

“Yes it is.
 Thanks tattle-tale Seth.” “Well you did and I thought the group had a right to know that.” Seth said sharply.
 “How could you Jazell?
 You could have gotten seriously hurt.
 Plus I bet all of us want a shot at them too.” She huffed and shook her head.
 The light brown curls that framed her pretty face bounced around playfully.
 “I’m fine Emily, seriously.” Jason was silent.
 He never talked much like Emily, who was easily the most talkative, friendly person I knew.
 Jason was more of the silent, watching type, who said little but noticed much.
 I traced in a puddle on the table, avoiding everyone’s eye contact as they stared at me.

Still, Rodregas knew with sudden clarity that he needed to establish himself as the one in charge.
 If he did not establish his leadership, the next time the Dire Cats were hungry they would try eating one of his party, or at least one of the horses.
 Rodregas walked over to the bear corpse and as he approached, both cats seemed to fully wake up and took on a crouch stance.
 He pretended to ignore them and pulled one of his short swords out, in a casual way.
 Rodregas kept his focus on the bear; he knew that lionesses in prides do most of the hunting and the alpha males simply ate after the kill was done.
 He started to cut away a large chunk of the bear’s haunch to take back to the barn for their dinner.
 One of the lionesses growled and bit down on the haunch not far from him.
 His heart stopped for a moment.
 Rodregas thought she was going to take his hand for a second.
 With his free hand he made a fist and slammed the side of her head.

We contemplated the worst as we watched what was our son, our first-born, drive off into complete uncertainty.
 We didn’t know Brandon at all, and we really believed we might never see him again.
 On the day of his birth which seemed like yesterday, I had watched as his little body took its first breath and now I felt like I might be watching him take his last.
 We chose not to tell any of my wife’s family because we were quite frankly, embarrassed.
 My wife’s family was similar to the 1950s TV Cleavers, and we didn’t think they would understand, so for now it remained a family secret.
 I selfishly didn’t want their advice or opinions because I didn’t expect them to ever understand.
 In their defense, they grew up in such a pure family environment that they were ill prepared for the drama that surrounded my upbringing.
 I have come to understand their view of me as a shady character, and the unlikely marriage of my kind to their perfect daughter, and I have accepted the fact that my past was a freak show compared to their lives.
 Now I had a contemporary freak-drama in my home, and didn’t think they’d be much help with it.
 My family on the other hand, was pre-disastered.

She looked up to see if she was close to Rick's house.
 It wasn't the house just ahead to the right, or the one beyond that.
 Had she come over that hill?
 Surely she couldn't have come very far.
 Panicking, she began to run.
 A woman was coming out of one house, wearing very short blue trousers, and Marie ran in the other direction.
 She had to find Rick's house!
 Being stuck in the future was bad enough, but if she couldn't find Rick again, she'd-- "Marie!"

She didn't take her eyes off him as he stood up.
 "Make sure your mother tells you what your duties are once we're married."
 He strode out of the house, heading for Mae's.
 Marie stared after him.
 She knew about sex.
 But-but .
 .
 .
 she'd thought it would be something pleasant.
 Was the harshness of his kiss indicative of what sex would be like?

“Qurrah said to kill you if I didn’t love you…”
 “Yet you didn’t,” she said.
 Harruq nodded, but said nothing else.
 “ _Hana fael!_ ” a voice cried from far down the alley.
 Both turned to see an elf raise his bow and fire.
 “Look out,” Aurelia said, shoving Harruq aside.
 The arrow hit her breast and reflected off as if hitting stone.
 She glanced at Harruq, her face a mixture of anger and fear.
 “Others have seen you kill, haven’t they?” she asked.
 Harruq could only shrug.

I could take it out with a few arrows but it’s best to kill Thrashers before they realize you’re there.
 Instead I lowered my bow and slowly crept up to it, until I could see the hideous claws on its hands and the hatred in its eyes.
 Thrashers hate everything and sometimes I wonder how they tolerate each other.
 I aimed for the head again and released the arrow.
 It whizzed silently into the thrasher and it howled in pain as the arrow dug into its fur.
 It whirled around, facing me.
 A low growl sounded in its throat and it charged.
 I ducked as it slashed my side and I winced.
 My shirt slowly turned blue from the trickling wound.
 Yes, blue, my blood is blue.

I’d been so absorbed in the book I had no idea how long I’d been reading.
 There was a light rap on my door.
 I tried to sound sleepy.
 “Yes?” “Frey, I’m on my way to the ridge.
 We will be leaving in the morning.” Ruby’s words confused me.
 I must have read through the night.
 “Okay.” “Steed is here.
 You can stay with him or go with me.” “I’ll stay.” I listened to her footsteps recede.
 When I was sure she was gone I slipped the book into my pack and hid it inside the material of the white gown.
 We would be leaving tomorrow, traveling to the peak.

She wasn't exactly plain-looking, but her features weren't very remarkable.
 She did have incredibly soft-looking wavy brown hair though.
 It looked like debate boy had pretty much finished answering her question.
 I looked back down at my book so I wouldn't get caught staring.
 I was just about to dive back into my text book when someone cleared their throat nearby.
 The tutor was standing at my elbow looking over my assignment.
 "Hi, I'm Albert, and you must be Adri."
 I winced again.
 It was going to take a lot of work to get people to use my full name.
 "Adriana, but I don't need any help."

"This is the first time I've actually walked out of a fix-up without breathing a sigh of relief."
 "I know what you mean."
 "It's usually so awkward, even if the guy is nice.
 But I felt comfortable tonight.
 I had a good time."
 "So did I."
 Rick opened her car door.
 "If you were into racquetball, I'd invite you out for a couple of games tomorrow.
 How about tennis--do you like tennis?"
 "Afraid not.

Donovan had been waiting in the hall just outside Alec's room.
 He'd pressed objects into Dom and Jasmin's hands, and then brushed his lips across the back of my hand.
 He slipped away, and then we'd entered a brightly-lit room filled with the rest of the pack.
 Alec had picked me up and carried me out to a massive SUV that I'd never seen before.
 Everyone piled in, and despite the seriousness of rapidly approaching events, I fell back asleep somewhere en route to our destination.
 Apparently you couldn't drive all the way though, because we were walking again, or at least some of us were.
 I could just make out Isaac off a little ways into the darkness.
 He was in hybrid form and moving with a ground-devouring gait that was deceptively smooth.
 Flashes of movement off to either side of us, lower to the ground, made me sure the girls were all following along on four legs.
 Alec shifted me around as he realized I was awake.

After the massacre, there had been no one.
 From the dead, it seemed, I had returned.
 Chevelle stepped to my right side, placing something cold and heavy in my hand.
 My sword.
 I knew what to do then.
 I took a deep, steadying breath as I raised the blade to the air.
 There was a faint pause, the briefest tick before the bird took flight, its wings hitting wind as the shift began, and then nothing could be heard but my name, roared in the song of the crowd below.

We are what we are, what we were.
 So, sophomore year was Birdie Burton.
 Shit.
 Should we use real names here?
 I guess, it’s ok.
 I don’t want Debby’s name here, that’s all—her real name, just because.
 Just out of respect for my first love, you know, and the first heart I broke.
 I broke her heart.
 And with Birdie I lost my virginity.
 On her parents’ bed, in the afternoon, with the door locked and people milling about outside.

He could not argue with her, not about that.
 Even he could see what she had sacrificed to save his life.
 “Where do we go?” he asked, his voice revealing his defeat.
 “We’ll figure it out in the morning.
 For now, we travel north.
 Your brother will be fine, I promise.”
 He nodded but said nothing.
 The two traveled in between the hills, exhausted but unwilling to stop their movement.
 “Why did you fight the elves?” she asked when their silence had stretched for more than half an hour.
 “It’ll be a long story,” he said.

Final assessment of China’s strategy will be determined by the further response of the political system to rising social expectations and growing pressure for greater individual freedom.
 Restructuring the UN
 The movement towards democracy is not merely a question of idealism.
 In some countries, particularly in Africa, it is an essential step towards over coming the desperate economic conditions that threaten the lives of millions of people.
 In many others, it can vastly accelerate the development process by releasing greater social initiative.
 In his message to the ICPF quoted earlier, the UN Secretary General emphasized the importance of democratization – what he chose to call political development – as an essential foundation and complement to peace, and to both economic and social development.
 There have been cases where development was accompanied by an authoritarian political system.
 But, we have invariably seen that if the participation in the market place is not accompanied by political participation, development efforts are brought to naught by social and political instability.... Once again, therefore, we see the inescapable relations governing the goals of peace, development and democratization – these are the goals of the United Nations.
 In order for this revolution to have its full beneficial impact on the world’s political and economic affairs, its principles need to be extended to cover all nations and international institutions.
 The end of the confrontation between democratic and autocratic superpowers within the UN system opens up the possibility of finally translating the idealistic aims of the UN into practical realities.

That image haunted me the most.
 It seemed familiar somehow.
 He’d let his guard down, and though strained with worry and fear, there was something else there, sadness or maybe just plain sympathy.
 “This is a good place to stop for the night,” Chevelle said, breaking my trance.
 I’d barely noticed the day pass.
 A glance at the path behind us showed the lake far in the distance below.
 It shook me from my stupor.
 I climbed down from my horse to stretch my legs over the trunk of a fallen tree, facing the mountain top instead of the view below, some part of me unable to accept the distance and height we had traveled.
 Chevelle led the horses to a thickset tree, its limbs stretching low and wide above the rocks.
 His hand spun to form a trough from the bark and tinder scattered beneath, the horses drinking as he used the same method to gather grasses from the sparse patches on the incline.

"...everyone's okay.
 I was somewhat worried about taking so much of our strength away.
 I'm glad it worked out."
 Alec turned towards the older man as I made my hesitant way over to the group.
 "Donovan, this is the young lady we hosted last night.
 Adri, this is Donovan."
 Feeling even more awkward than normal, I stuck out my hand, only to feel my eyes widen as he gracefully took my hand in his own, and bent down to brush his lips across it.
 "My sincere apologies that we weren't better hosts.
 Please let me know if there is anything you need to make your stay here more comfortable."
 I stammered out a thanks as Donovan released my hand.

I think he married a girl from Russia, one of those mail-order brides.
 I think that she was desperate to get out of Russia.
 The terrible poverty and such just made her desperate to get out of the country.
 Art – Well as long as she’s pretty.
 Other wise, well I can’t imagine that he has much self-confidence left.
 Karen – I’ve seen a couple of pictures, she isn’t.
 Art – Stay in Russia and have no foreseeable future, or come to the United States and marry a stranger who just happens to turn out to be a contributor to the growth of the lesbian community.
 I wonder what would happen to the poor man if she decided to go back to Russia as a lesbian.
 Karen – I don’t know, I hope it never happens to him, my family would make his life hell if they ever found out.
 Art – A good reason to stay away from them.

“I should bind my Infernal gift as well, especially as I will never be a great magician.” Rodregas had not really expected an answer, but Doi’van surprised him by nodding his great head and pointing to the far back almost in a corner that strangely was the only one in shadow.
 “I think the Ni’Barrbari, the daemon known as the Night Panther, would add a bit of subtly to your Celestial Lion.
 While hunters, they are also healers and not as vicious as most of the others.
 It might also cause less confusion if you are able to gain both Infernal and Celestial great sigils to have ones that share some similarities.” Rodregas nodded and walked toward where Doi’van had pointed, having to circle around what appeared to be a bear with the front feet of a stork and the over large head of an owl.
 Rodregas felt his skin crawl and he almost left the chamber, but then the cat shape behind the daemon became clear.
 The Daemonic shape seemed to be missing the odd combinations of the others.
 It looked like the large Panthers he had heard of that were found in the southern jungles.
 It had no mane like the lions he knew and its fur was black.
 In fact it was the darkest black he had ever seen.
 This was why, at first, he had not seen the shape in the dark.

Eternity
 Philosopher and theologian Dallas Willard proposes that people who are right with God won't readily notice when they die, because they will already reside in the kingdom of heaven.
 Though I can't second his proposal with assurance, I see evidence for it, as I believe I have spent time in the kingdom of heaven.
 And if we can go there in this life, the difference might be as slight as crossing the state line into Oregon.
 On my own, I won't propose anything about the after-life.
 Observing and attempting to grasp this life is enough of a challenge.
 But God will make justice come about somewhere, somehow.
 Of that much I'm convinced.
 Sylvia used to divide humanity into people of good will and the others.
 I’ll use her term and ask, how could any person of good will, when confronted with plenty of evidence, circumstantial though it may be, refuse to at least hope for a God who with mercy resolves all the horrors of life here and now and makes justice happen in a golden and joyous eternity?

The political necessity of maintaining popular support and the threat of exposure by the media force elected governments to take all necessary steps to ensure sufficient food supplies.
 Modern democracy is the political counterpart of the market economic system.
 Historically, democracy broke the monopoly of the aristocracy over governance of the people, giving freedom and rights to the individual politically.
 The market system – basing itself on property rights and self-determined initiatives of the individual producer and consumer – is an economic expression of the same principle.
 Both democracy and market-oriented economies decentralize authority and decision making, providing the essential legal and regulatory framework and empowering the individual to choose and act with minimum direction or interference from above.
 Both depend for their success on the quality of those choices, which means on the quality of education and information possessed by the mass of people, and on the freedom and dynamism of the population.
 In contrast, authoritarian systems and command economies centralize decision making, restrict the flow of information to the public, foster vast unresponsive bureaucracies, limit individual freedom and initiative within narrow bounds, and encourage obedience and conformity rather than innovation.
 The spread of education, which fosters independent thinking, and dissemination of information through the media were important factors in undermining public acceptance of communism in Eastern Europe.
 In a real sense, it was Gorbachev’s policy of glasnost that brought down the Iron Curtain.
 It opened up an insular society and exposed it to an avalanche of new information, new ideas and new possibilities, which released a fervent aspiration in the people for a better life.

I didn’t roll out of bed for a minute; instead I lay staring at the ceiling trying to prepare my brain for the day ahead.
 I heard my mom and dad walking downstairs, talking excitedly about where they thought I was going to go today.
 I rolled off my bed and walked sleepily over to my dresser to pull out a pair of jeans and a shirt.
 After I had pulled the shirt over my head, I grabbed my half empty traveling bag and headed down stairs.
 I dropped my bag near the door and walked over to the kitchen table.
 My mom had placed a full plate of eggs and toast on the table; I sat down and started to eat.
 My mom hurried over and glanced at her watch.
 “You have about a half an hour until you have to leave.
 Eat up.” I responded with a quick shovel of food.
 Within 25 minutes, I was standing by the door with my stomach all queasy.

There was no mistaking our destination when we spotted it.
 It looked like the recreation yard in the film One Flew Over the Coo Coo’s Nest, as people milled about, stopping and turning to look at us as we entered the parking lot.
 The facility itself might have been a roadside migrant worker motel.
 People were roaming around the grounds doing everything from raking leaves to just hanging in groups, but each one stopped what they were doing to examine us as we drove in.
 We could immediately tell that visitors to this desolate location were rare.
 Brandon approached the vehicle with enthusiasm and the brightest broadest smile we have ever seen on his face.
 We instantly noticed his weight gain and he proudly announced through our open car window that he was nearing 170 pounds, and he looked healthy for the first time in so many years.
 His complexion was clear and his eyes were the bright blue they once were and the whites of his eyes were shinny and clear.
 Brandon could hardly wait for us to open the car door and he embraced each of us as if he hadn’t seen us in years.
 I know I hadn’t seen him like this in years.

He coughed violently, and blood ran down his lips and neck.
 “Don’t feel like answering?” the elf mocked.
 “Why did you kill them?
 For money?
 Power?
 How many died to better your miserable excuse of a life?”
 Another twist.
 Qurrah leaned forward, clutching at his tormenter’s shaking hands.
 Words spilled from the half-orc’s mouth, garbled and nearly unintelligible.
 “What is it you wish to say to me?” the elf asked, ignoring the flailing hands that pawed at his face.

Rodregas had known that in a fair fight he could kill him.
 Korin was no warrior, and his actions spoke of cowardice when Korin hurt those who had no chance in a fight against him.
 Rodregas had been trying to get him alone, where he could kill him without blame, for years.
 Rodregas went over and reached down to grab the bottom of the heavily made bed, and almost fell over when the bed lifted far more easily than expected.
 The sound of wood screeched as weight switched to the back legs of the bed and then moved at his awkward action, and the top of the columns smashed against the plaster ceiling.
 Rodregas carefully lowered the bed back down; as the bed settled back to the floor he was covered by a light dusting of plaster from the damaged ceiling.
 Was Rodregas really that strong?
 Or was the bed just lighter than it looked?
 He went back over to the trunk and lifted it up; it to went up too easily and felt strangely light.
 Next he went over the dresser.

I probably would've stayed there all night if not for the howling.
 It'd been going for several seconds before it pulled me back from the mental abyss I'd been so eagerly approaching.
 I looked around blankly for several more heartbeats before I finally managed to place the noise.
 Wolves.
 There weren't supposed to be any wolves in the area, but there wasn't any ignoring my ears.
 I numbly pulled myself back up, and began stumbling back towards the party, only to stop as another howl echoed down through the canyon.
 It was between me and everyone else.
 I turned and started into a shuffling run.
 Maybe the wolf would be attracted to the noise and light.
 Maybe I'd be able to get far enough away it wouldn't smell me.

But it turned out to be completely unlike the night of their betrothal.
 Davis was in an abominable mood, complaining about the food, the service, even the color of the tablecloth.
 And he was too tired to go dancing after dinner.
 "Can we at least go for a walk by the river?"
 Marie asked as they left the restaurant.
 "I'm not up to it.
 I happen to have put in a long day of work while you were out with your friends.
 There's more to life than parties and shopping, Marie."
 "I'm sorry."
 Partly for him but mostly for herself.

Great, now what do I do?
 That was a fail, I scolded myself.
 A FAIL!
 “Nice try,” Seth whispered and I think he really meant it.
 Or maybe he was teasing me.
 It’s hard to tell in these situations.
 Seth brandished his sword.
 “My turn.” “Really, warrior?” Kojas said and laughed.
 His laugh was like a bunch of spiders running down my back.
 “You think your sword will do any more than the pathetic archer girl’s arrow?” “Hey,” I shouted, “I’m not a pathetic archer girl!” Oh course, the two ignored me.

Then another rattle that didn't end sounded, vibrating all around us.
 Another seemed to join it, then another and another until the noise was unbearably loud.
 Sick, quiet laughter sounded all around us.
 It giggled and laughed in amusement, shrieking at us.
 The laughter stopped, but the rattle didn't.
 But whatever it was, it surrounded us.
 The four of us pressed together.
 “This is the prey?” a rake-like voice cackled.
 “This is nothing!” I saw Seth draw his sword and the rest of us readied our weapons.
 I gripped my bow so hard that I was afraid it might break in two.

“Grand Council.” I drew a sharp breath at the words.
 “The calling is simply service to Grand Council.
 A hundred years of servitude under the guise of duty and honor.
 What is honorable about doing their bidding?” “So you don’t… answer the call?” I stumbled, searching for words.
 His laughter was a roar.
 “No.
 We do not answer.” It settled and he added, “They do not call.” At that, Steed joined in, chuckling.
 It didn’t make sense.
 I knew I had been assigned a watcher.
 From the North.

After the staff they moved to the bow where Imeralda became the master.
 To use the magical Black Yew bows required learning a spell to merging with the bow.
 The spell was unlike anything Rodregas had learned.
 Imeralda said it was seldom taught to non-nymphs, though Ravenhurr had known the spell and taught a few of the guards with a touch of the talent.
 Using the bows was a matter of sending your innate power into the wood and singing with it.
 Not singing out loud, but making the power vibrate and move in a rhythm that matched the wood.
 When that magical rhythm was reached, the bow suddenly became almost fluid and moved nearly of its own volition.
 The arrows flew with incredible force and accuracy.
 The only problem was that the three could not practice freely as the arrows sometimes shattered on impact, as they flew with such force.
 Doi’van quickly mastered the spell and the use of the bow.

 No one guards a big, beaten log.”
 “But you have yet to face men in combat,” Qurrah said.
 “Do not be overzealous about your skills.
 Confident, perhaps, but not foolish.
 Don’t die on me, brother, for I need you more than ever.”
 “Yeah, I know,” Harruq said, growing quiet.
 The subject of Qurrah’s experiments always made him uneasy.
 “This time there will be a slight difference,” Qurrah said.
 “What’s that?”

It’s my name.
 Well short for Arthur.
 Karen – I mean your replacement for ‘pervert’.
 Something to explain why you, a man self-professed to not being interested in art, is so knowledgeable about Miss Struan.
 Art – Ah yes, well how about ‘Father of Elizabeth’s best friend’?
 It doesn’t really roll off the tongue like ‘Art’ does, on the other hand Art is rather harsh itself.
 Art.
 Art.
 My God, my name sounds like a sound that a dog makes.

 Johnny – I mean to make he do all of that.
 To change her.
 Was it me?
 Jim – I don’t think so.
 Dad did say that your birth was a bit longer than mine, but that wouldn’t have done anything.
 Johnny – Then why?
 Jim – Do you remember Grandpa Davis?
 Johnny – No, he died before I was born.
 Jim – I know, and no loss there.

The ban on use should be followed by urgent measures to dismantle and scrap this entire class of weapons worldwide.
 9.Highest priority must be given to controlling and reversing the proliferation of small arms in line with the determined international measures employed to curb hijacking.
 As an immediate first step, these weapons should be classified and a UN register created to monitor their manufacture and sale.
 Agreements should be negotiated between major arms suppliers to severely restrict production and sales.
 Strong sanctions must be instituted to discourage states from actively or passively abetting small arms proliferation, especially to non-state actors.
 10.UN action to curb the international trade in major armaments needs to go further than the existing Arms Register.
 Arms exports to areas identified by the UN as trouble spots should be banned by international law.
 An independent agency should be established to verify the submissions from arms-exporting states.
 Major arms exporters should agree to consult the Security Council in advance about large orders received for destabilizing weapons and, where appropriate, coordinate actions to limit the size of arms transfers.
 11.Narcotic drug production and trafficking must be treated as threats to international peace and security.

Once she got home, she'd never be able to kiss him again.
 She'd never again spend the evening snuggled up in his arms.
 She tried to swallow the lump.
 Rick would be gone from her life forever.
 Tears formed in her eyes, and she squeezed them shut.
 She could easily imagine the excitement of her return home, but she couldn't imagine not having Rick any more.
 He'd become the center of her life.
 She-- "Marie?"
 Her eyes flew open, and she looked up to see him standing by the sofa.
 "I-I was just trying to think of something to make for dinner."

My wife was hysterical and rightfully so.
 I stood there numb, wondering what I had done and how did my efforts to be the best father I could be turn into this?
 I’d hit him—once.
 But I intended to never hit my child.
 I had promised myself I would never, ever repeat this offense I had endured as a child.
 I just wanted to slap him out of it, to hurt him as we were hurting, because he seemed oblivious to the magnitude of our pain.
 It all happened so fast and when I realized that Brandon was bringing these drugs into our house, while we thought we were detoxing him, it was beyond me.
 I felt violated in so many ways, all at once and I snapped.
 Brandon’s nose was broken and my wife and sister-in-law attended to him to stop the bleeding and I sat in silent shock with Harry and Bryce flanking me on the couch— possible guards’ against any further explosion into violence.
 There was no threat of that, as this intervention was over.

As a condition for membership, each country would by legal enactment forego war as an instrument of policy and undertake not to commit any act of external aggression against any other member or non-member for any reason whatsoever.
 Any violation would be grounds for immediate expulsion.
 Members would agree to contribute an assessed sum of money, equipment and military personnel towards the maintenance of a standing military force under the command of a centralized military leadership.
 In addition, the peace force could be granted the right to recruit personnel directly from member countries Members would also agree to limit their own overall military spending within norms fixed by the organization.
 Members would be banned from possession of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
 Existing weapons would be destroyed or turned over to the peace force.
 As in NATO, members would agree by treaty to consider an attack on one member as an attack on all.
 The peace force would intervene automatically and unconditionally – defensively and, if necessary, offensively – to protect the sovereignty and international borders of any member country, provided that it conformed to the rules under the charter.
 The organization could also assist members in fighting drug trafficking and terrorist activities.
 The benefits of this cooperative peace-keeping mechanism would be manifold:

I wasn't going to fall all over myself to become her friend or anything, but I figured it was worth observing her for a little bit.
 If she really was cool then we might strike up a friendship at some point.
 If she wasn't, then the sooner I could confirm that fact the better off I'd be.
 I pulled out my book, study guide, and some paper, and got busy with my next self-assigned homework set.
 I was up to graphing now, which was about as straightforward as you could get.
 I made pretty good progress, pausing from time to time to stretch my neck and look around.
 The girl had flipped her card over to the red side, and had a tutor with her, a clumsy-looking boy who looked like he might be a senior.
 Based on the glasses, and the fact he had to have picked them out without any input from a girl younger than forty, I figured he was in debate, or maybe the chess club.
 He was probably incredibly nice, and boring as watching paint dry.
 Exactly the kind of guy my mom would turn cartwheels over.

I never did figure out what it was he'd done, but apparently it had him thinking he was even more of a stud than normal.
 Whatever it was, it had Brandon pissed, which was a refreshing change.
 If he had to be friends with some of these people out of responsibility, that was one thing, but letting them continue to be jerks was taking it too far.
 Nobody was more surprised than me when Brandon pushed back from the table, scanned the room, and then pulled me to my feet.
 We spent the rest of lunch pacing around the outside of the school while he worked through whatever was bothering him.
 When the warning bell finally rang, he turned and looked at me with a considering smile.
 We stood like that for a good thirty seconds before he reached a single finger up and traced the left side of my face as he leaned in slightly.
 It was simultaneously the scariest and most exciting thing I'd ever experienced.
 Even as I leaned in a little bit myself, my thundering heart seemed to be trying to leap out of my throat solely for the purpose of disrupting what looked very much like it was going to be my first kiss.
 Every tiny hair on my body stood up in a shiver of nervousness as he tilted his head to the side, and then he broke off, shaking himself slightly as he gave me a smile.

That started what seemed like a war.
 All the dwarfs scrambled towards us and I simply shot them and Emily fried them.
 Then Jason and Seth dissolved from the shadows and entered the clearing.
 “What are you two doing here?” I yelled across to them, annoyed that they hadn’t made their presence known earlier.
 Seth fought his way over to me, “Why do you need to know?” “Because you just randomly appeared and I would like to know what you’re doing in Emily’s backyard in the middle of the night.” I pointed out and took down the last dwarf.
 We gathered around the barely burning embers, after we had re-entered our own world.
 Emily and I quickly summed up what we had learned from the dwarfs.
 Jason listened and didn’t speak, like usual, and for once Seth didn’t interrupt.
 When we were finished nobody said a word as they soaked up everything that had happened.
 It seemed like it was just too much for all of us to take in.

“More dead for his army,” Qurrah surmised.
 “No,” Harruq said.
 “With you.”
 Qurrah nodded, knowing he disrespected his brother to think he might not have noticed.
 “He wanted my name,” Qurrah said.
 “I did not give it.
 I have served a master once.
 I will not do so again.”
 Harruq frowned but said no more.
 Together they climbed down from the wall and returned home.

He didn’t influence me.
 I loved the cat, man.
 That’s enough isn’t it?
 I mean I learned from him, he learned from me, I’m still learning from Lor, you know, that’s the world, man.
 If you ain’t learning you’re dead.
 So, I’m still trying to absorb some things, follow some things that I thought of maybe back then and Jimi was there, he was undeniably there, like the monolith from 2001, you know?
 So, there were a lot of us cats playing the guitar, and…uh, I’ve lost the thread of what I was saying.
 CM:  	What about Dylan?
 BG: 	I have confused recollections of my first awareness of Bob Dylan.
 I have a vague memory of hearing “Song for Woody” on FM 100, back in Memphis, which at that time was an album-oriented station, not limited to a ludicrous playlist like it is today.

.
 a picture caught his eye.
 It was a large one of a family of four, all of them looking very sober with the exception of the daughter, a very beautiful young woman with a slight smile and a twinkle in her eye.
 She had dark hair and eyes and long, slender fingers.
 Her ugly dress hid the rest, but he could easily imagine that her figure matched her face.
 Looking at the caption, he saw that her name was Marie Tranton and that she’d been born in 1904.
 He looked for the date of the picture and found that it had been taken in 1926.
 So she was 22 in this picture.
 Hmmm .

As usual, Alec slipped into class a half second before the bell.
 I was so happy I forgot how arrogant he was, and I smiled at him as he sat down.
 It was like he was looking at something that wasn't even human.
 My insides seemed to freeze and shrink.
 I couldn't even muster up my normal blush of embarrassment.
 I'd had plenty of people hate me since I'd arrived in Sanctuary, but he was the first person I'd met who I was convinced wouldn't have thrown me a life preserver if I was drowning.
 It wasn't even because saving me would be too much work.
 He was completely convinced the world would be a better place without me.
 I'd never been so unnerved in my life.
 As Mrs. Alexander took roll and then released us into our groups, I was still trying to pull myself back together.

The elf smiled as if trying to appear amused, but it faltered miserably.
 “You are looking in the wrong place,” he said.
 “Search the woods just outside town.
 Call her name a couple times.
 She’ll hear you.”
 “Thank you,” Harruq said, grateful even though his insides churned.
 He had faced many men in battle, and yet here he was, his heart skipping beats at the thought of meeting this mysterious Aurelia.
 What was wrong with him?
 “You are welcome, half-orc,” the elf said before moving on, the bow still hung comfortably on his back.
 Harruq watched him go, staring longer than he felt he should.

Everything else was weeny.
 I wasn’t tough.
 I was wispy and blond and too pretty.
 And I got bullied relentlessly.
 Pushed to the ground, laughed at when I tried to join in during P.E..
 I started dreading recess, you know.
 I just wanted to stay inside and read or write songs in my looseleaf notebook.
 I hated school, hated those bullies—hell, I still do, I hate bullying—but music was my out, or, I guess my in.
 When I started playing guitar at the school, on the playground, at the talent shows—where I always won, man, every fucking time—I was something else.
 I was no longer a weeny.

Chapter 15: Happy Frickin’ Holidays!
 As Thanksgiving approached, our traditions looked impossible to pull off.
 We were evasive when we called my wife’s parents to tell them not to come to our house as they usually did.
 We said we had some personal family issues to deal with.
 We could tell their feelings were hurt, but we didn’t feel we had any other choice.
 We did allow my younger brother Harry in on the whole awful situation and invited him to come to the house as planned.
 I needed my younger brother because he had developed a great relationship with my boys.
 He’s 11 years younger than me, and in the music business where he works shooting videos for rap artists my sons listen to.
 He has had a solid relationship with both of our boys and that could translate into communication.
 This Thanksgiving we had an agenda that didn’t include turkey and all the trimmings.

Or just have dinner with your new love interest?
 Art – Neither, I’m going to take a nap, the world isn’t worthy of a benefactor of my sort, and I have a date with Karen tomorrow night.
 That sounds good.
 Oh yes before I go, remember what I asked you about helping me with Johnny…
 Jim – I’ve been thinking about what I’m going to try to do.
 Art – That’s good, but I have a new hurdle to throw in.
 Jim – What now?
 Art – We’re adopting Eugene.
 He asked me to do it, I think that’s the reason he wanted to talk to me so badly.
 It needs to be done.

After a few minutes she stopped and lay down with a sigh.
 The beach was beautiful, and the air smelled so good.
 She liked being here with Rick.
 All morning he'd looked at her like she was a goddess.
 Or a cone of ice cream.
 She giggled at the thought.
 Wondering if Rick had heard her, she glanced over at him.
 He hadn't moved.
 Raising her head, she leaned a little closer to him.
 He was asleep!

 "I love you too.
 And I want to marry you.
 How soon can we get married?
 And where's my ring?"
 He laughed, setting her back to look at her.
 "We'll go inside and get it.
 But you have to tell me what happened.
 You wanted so badly to go home."
 He gazed down into her eyes.

“Practice.
 You should be able to protect yourself.” I remembered his words from before the revelation that ended my magic lessons.
 Fighters.
 A chill ran down my spine as I nodded my assent.
 I’d skinned out of a few run-ins with council and it was no secret how they operated.
 I might be safe enough with Chevelle, but if the others retrieved me… “We will work again at first light and possibly as we ride.” Part of me wanted to argue, As we ride?
 But I knew how serious it was.
 I was a fugitive.
 And now it appeared even Grand Council was looking for me.
 I had no idea what my punishment would be.

The words felt hollow, nothing more than self-serving lies.
 He kept remembering the mother with her young babe clutched to her breast as she fled from him.
 When he had rammed her, she had tucked the child to guard it from the fall.
 Right before the kill, she had held him, trying to protect him.
 “Why?” he asked.
 A part of him worried he might wake his brother, but he was too drained to care.
 “Why did she do that?
 She could have run faster without the child!”
 No, he knew that answer.
 She would not abandon her child just as he would not abandon Qurrah.

For the first time in weeks, a deep sadness grips me.
 Where is it coming from, I wonder?
 After a while, I give up wondering and pray for an answer.
 When no answer arrives, I decide to track my thoughts backward, which leads me to the source, which was a recognition that I had lived much of my life in the aftermath of a grievous mistake.
 If I hadn't been so stubborn, if I had trusted God from the time I first believed, I might've spent all these years in a richer world, maybe not living every moment in the kingdom of heaven, but residing close enough so I could visit more regularly.
 And I might've done a lot of good for other people.
 In this sorry condition, I decide that my darkest sin, the one so loathsome I should never stop grieving over it, isn't any of the wicked stuff I have thought or done.
 My darkest sin is failing to do all the thousands of good works I could have done for people.
 All because I was willful and didn't allow myself to truly love them.
 Some folks would assure me this sadness and guilt means a spiritual battle is raging.

The process of getting one drug dealer to set up the next is as old as the trade itself (my own brother had done it over 35 years before).
 During the interrogation, which included the usual scare tactics, the cops showed him a great deal of information they had collected on him.
 Even though they didn’t have the bust they wanted, they had him verbally agreeing to provide drugs and several people willing to testify that Brandon had provided them with Oxy and other drugs.
 They had been monitoring him for some time and had ample surveillance to make up for the lack of drugs at his actual bust.
 Brandon had been dealing Oxy for the past few years and the police had been looking to get him.
 Brandon had at one time been moving thousands of these tiny green prescription pain pills through California, making nighttime drives to Los Angeles and back to buy huge quantities to supply the Sacramento area.
 They were charging him with three felonies and he was facing five plus years in prison.
 Faced with the charges, Brandon waved his attorney rights and talked too much— a strung out drug addict who just got popped.
 The interrogation lasted nearly twenty hours; although, to Brandon, it felt like three days.
 Faced with the abundance of evidence and the thought of five years in prison, Brandon broke and agreed to bust a dealer named Steve.

Let us fight it when it comes, but not sooner, not now, not while they sleep…”
 He looked away as if expecting to be berated for the outburst.
 Instead, Qurrah walked over and put a hand on his brother’s shoulder.
 “Be careful,” he said in his raspy voice.
 “Your power was given at a cost.
 Any hesitation or doubt risks the permanency of your gift.
 I understand, please know that.
 In time, you will learn, and you will see things as I do.
 Until then, rest.
 Velixar will come for us soon.

It is not the Sorcerer Ravenhurr.” It was a woman’s voice.
 Then a much deeper voice, one that seemed half growl, responded, “She is right.
 This is no sorcerer we fight.” The voice was from his present combatant, the only one who had proven to be dangerous to him.
 “She is right,” Rodregas said, “I am not Ravenhurr.” “We don’t know that,” challenged another voice from the dark.
 As he stepped forward he recognized the shape of the large aggressive man that Rodregas had first thought was the leader.
 “If he is not Gerald, then he must be Ravenhurr.” There was a silent response to that statement, but finally one of the other men lit a torch and held it up.
 Rodregas quickly realized that in front of him were five of the eight prisoners who had been held in the dungeon.
 “How did you track me here?” Rodregas asked.
 The one with the torch waved it over toward the lone female of the group, the half AElfin maiden from the tower.
 “I am afraid you are not much of a woodsman, not that it is easy to hide wagon tracks,” she stated, her voice hinting disapproval at his skill.

 She hugged her mother.
 "I love you, Mother.
 And I need--" "Marie?
 Davis is leaving."
 John had come in search of them.
 "Are you all right?"
 "We're just having a mother/daughter talk," Mrs. Tranton said as Marie reached for a napkin.
 "Tell Davis she'll be out in a minute."

I don’t know what Crafty and Skippy thought—I didn’t even leave them a note.
 I feel bad about it now—and this, finally, I think, was what pissed Crafty off and led him to hire a lawyer for himself, to try and, you know, basically, steal my material.
 It was like, if you’re not gonna represent yourself well, we’re gonna take away your soul, all your work, all your history.
 Shit.
 That shark he hired---what a bastard.
 But, I was oblivious at the time.
 God bless Pete.
 He handled it all.
 While I was gone.
 Only he knew I was gone although we were incommunicado, no phone even.

“That’s sweet Harruq, but why?”
 “Just to, you know.” He kicked a rock.
 “Wanted to thank you for sparring with me,” he said.
 “They’re beautiful,” Aurelia said as she inhaled the aroma.
 “But why the box?”
 Harruq turned a new shade of red.
 “Well, I’d look weird walking down the street with those flowers in hand.
 I do have a reputation to keep.”
 The elf laughed.
 “Thank you, Harruq.

My family’s loud simultaneous gasps accompanied Harry and Bryce’s rush to restrain me as if I was going to continue the beating.
 Maybe kill Brandon.
 This is how angry we all were.
 How out of our element.
 And now I’d done it.
 Lisa jumped up screaming and crying and yelled, “Stop!” Brandon lay face down and his blood soaked the carpet beneath his head; his hands clutched his face; he moaned and rolled over.
 Blood oozed from between his clenched fingers and ran down his chest when he sat up.
 My wife was hysterical and rightfully so.
 I stood there numb, wondering what I had done and how did my efforts to be the best father I could be turn into this?
 I’d hit him—once.

And then blood poured out from the face of the lone elf.
 The eyeballs hit the ground before the dead body did.
 “Hurry,” the necromancer said.
 “This is but a taste of what we must do.”
 “Very well,” Harruq said.
 He tried to follow but the pain in his side stopped him.
 He clutched his bleeding side and breathed deeply.
 His armor had saved him, but the elf had managed to penetrate deeper than he thought.
 “Are you fine, Harruq?” Qurrah asked, glancing back and halting his walk.
 “I’m coming,” he said, marching after his brother.

Dismiss Christ, trust ourselves, we would discover the solution.
 Simple.
 After a couple of Russell’s books, Eric brought home Thus Spoke Zarathustra, by Friedrich Nietzsche, a strangely enchanting poet.
 Zarathustra claimed that some of us could become supermen.
 First, our spirits would need to brave the desert like camels, forsaking our past, our heritage, all the values of common people.
 Once we had finished forsaking, we would metamorphose into lions and proceed to slay the dragon called "Thou Shalt".
 After burying the dragon, the lion would die and resurrect as a child, the infant superman, innocent and forgiving, a new beginning, a sacred Yes.
 Then, we could discover and assert our own wills, and use those wills to conquer and change the world.
 On a Sunday morning in January, a few days before my mom’s release from the hospital, a gang of us high school boys sat naked atop a giant flat boulder in a desert oasis called Palm Canyon, a few miles out of Borrego Springs and a two-mile trek past the end of a dirt road.
 We were a savage crew, six sunburnt white boys, all but one of us bald since we had shaved our heads in protest against a track coach who ordered Bill Torrey, Cliff’s younger brother, to get his shaggy hair mowed.

He looked into my eyes like he saw something there, like he really knew me.
 We gazed out over the cliff, at the horizon… endless.
 I felt his hand on my back and closed my eyes, relaxing into the comfortable, familiar feel of it.
 He pushed me with full force.
 I flew off the cliff, falling straight down.
 I stared back at him as he stood, watching me fall, nothing but open sky above and below.
 I couldn’t imagine why he’d throw me from the cliff, couldn’t think of the magic to stop myself, couldn’t see when I would crash into the base, the rocks below.
 My arms flailed as I jerked awake.
 The group stared at me.
 “Frey?” Ruby asked.

An army, the same that had removed him and his brother from their home, slept so close.
 Every one of them contemplated their death.
 Qurrah closed his eyes and inhaled the cold night air.
 Yes, the tension was delectable.
 The quiet moments before battle were a rare thing that so very few were lucky enough to experience.
 Fear, worry, hope, prayer, regret, and sorrow all floated to the stars.
 The half-orc let his attuned mind drink it all in.
 Beautiful, he thought.
 Absolutely beautiful.

He sat behind me and pulled me into his arms, holding me as I wept.
 It was more right than anything had been in a long, long time.
 I woke with new resolve.
 I stood, prepared to make things right, but something was… off.
 The group surrounded me, tense.
 I glanced around but couldn’t see why.
 And then, from nowhere, I was thrown into the air.
 I landed hard against my back.
 I slid down, barely standing on my feet.
 Someone was in front of me.

Some analysts of the record see things in it, which I’ve heard you deny, yet, there does seem to be something underneath the surface of these songs, something darker.
 Dave Marsh described it as “Mansonish deviltry mixed with Buffalo Springfield lyrics and Cream jams.”  It’s this Charlie Manson element that I’d like to hear you talk about, this school of thought that the record is some sort of coded message, a hint of what was to come, a gateway to the Apocalypse, according to Crawdaddy.
 BG:  	Is that a question?
 CM:  	It’s a whole area of question.
 It’s a school of thought—surely you’ve heard or read some of this.
 But I’ve never heard you talk about it.
 BG:  	I dropped out of school, especially schools of thought.
 CM: 	Um--
 BG: 	You got kids playing records backwards, you got kids hearing drug references in everything, from “Lucy in the Sky” to “In Real Time”.
 You got academics plumbing rock music now for the kind of meanings they dug out of Wordsworth and Coleridge.

Yes, it could.
 It came back to me then.
 I dropped into a chair, my head falling into my hands to cover my face.
 Ruby started to say something, but Chevelle cut her off.
 “Won’t you offer your guest breakfast?” She sniffed.
 “Lunch maybe.” A plate of food landed on the table in front of me with a slap.
 “Thank you,” I managed.
 I was hungry, despite the embarrassment.
 I grabbed the plate and started eating.
 Ruby and Steed were sitting across from me.

“Those in the back, flush them out of the houses.”
 Velixar watched the Neldaren army scatter, some chasing elves down streets, others barging into locked homes.
 Screams of pain and dying, although just few and random, filled the air.
 He drank it in and smiled.
 “Where are you my disciples?” he asked.
 “Let me hear the screams of your victims so that I may find you.”

We can just go the next time they come to town."
 I nodded and smiled, surprised that the thought of so much time trapped in a car with someone didn't make me want to run away screaming.
 Cars were scary.
 All that time with nothing to do but talk, and once you started talking to people they wanted to know things.
 Things that weren't any of their business, things you weren't ready to discuss.
 Somehow I knew Rachel wouldn't pry.
 It was like keeping so many secrets for her brother had made her especially sensitive to other people's secrets.
 Another few steps brought us to the door, and I held it open for Rachel to follow me outside.
 The intense heat felt like a physical blow.
 I could almost feel my pores open up in an effort to keep me from overheating.

The man in black gestured to the city nestled against the forest.
 “This city has long been treated neutral, even though it resides within Neldar’s border.
 The elves will not take kindly to removal from a home many have lived in since before our dear king’s grandparents were alive.”
 “I eagerly await the bloodshed,” Qurrah said.
 He bowed to his master.
 “Go.
 The night is young.
 Taint the dreams of the slumbering.”
 Qurrah left Velixar to sit alone before the fire.
 The dark night sang a song of crickets and wind.

I've spent months looking for a name for this flower, and at the point of giving up, inspiration struck today.
 Lagrimas del Angel always come at too high a cost.
 Nothing so exquisite could be otherwise.
 Please don't despair.
 --@ The hand-drawn symbol on the bottom of the page was so familiar it almost felt like a part of me now.
 He'd saved our house, got Mom a job, and then given me the best birthday present I could've asked for.
 I felt my insides clench and knot, but this time it was happiness that brought tears to my eyes.
 My wavering vision was just up to making out the outline of Rachel's present where I'd left it on the table.
 Feeling incredibly ungrateful and thoughtless, I limped over to the table and tore open the delicate wrapping paper.
 It was a copy of the latest Les Misérables movie, complete with the score from the most recent Broadway production, and a signed picture of the entire cast.

Doi’van asked Imeralda, “Did you know they were tracking us?” “No, I had no clue.” she said looking embarrassed.
 She then added, “I am not really a great tracker.
 I mean, our Paladin was easy enough to find but tracking Dire Cats through the forest, that would require true skill.” “But you did not sense them at all?” asked the Hellborn again.
 “No,” she shook her head.
 “Why?” she asked, her voice curious on his repeated questioning.
 “Because I am wondering if our ‘Paladin’ has a connection to the Dire Cats.
 I know a Celestial lion was used in the ceremony and whoever our Paladin is I assume he now has it’s essence, and those two were taken as the Celestial’s mates.”  Imeralda and Doi’van looked at him, and then she slowly added, “And what was one of your first actions?
 You freed them from the dungeon.
 Dire Cats are smarter than regular lions; they might see you as an ally or part of their herd.
 No wait, I think with cats you call them prides.

Eugene – The Sumo-mobile is just a cheap rip-off of the bat-mobile.
 The entire story is about a famous millionaire sumo wrestler turned vigilante.
 “Wrestling for the honor of the downtrodden.”  What the hell were they smoking when they came up with that one?
 And Twiggy?
 No chicks would ever like him, he weighs 50 pounds, chicks like guys with big muscles.
 Then there’s his hair, did he stick a finger in a light socket?
 And don’t forget that Pig Latin and Klingon don’t count real languages.
 When he does say something it’s usually so pointless and offensive that any chicks who might have managed to overlook his bizarre hair and lack of physical mass would be so insulted that they would probably try to kill the annoying little bastard.
 Jim – Don’t even compare Batman to Sumo Assassin!
 Batman is a weakling in a stupid costume with some gizmos, without his gizmos he’s just a loser in tights.

She was our class valedictorian in high school.
 When she gave her speech I wanted to stand up and say, “I love her.
 She gave me my first head.”  (laughs)  And I was voted, of course, “most talented.”  But, I’ve skipped ahead.
 We should spend more time in high school, if you know what I mean.
 It’s when I cut my teeth, honed my personality, became, for better or worse, what I became.
 Do you wanna start back in ninth grade now?
 CM:  	Sure.
 Yes.
 Exactly.

“Burn!” he shouted, loud enough for the elves to hear.
 The wood blackened, smoke billowed from his hands, and then the entire building erupted as if bathed in oil.
 Qurrah laughed, untouched by the heat.
 He could not say the same for the elves, and as their pained screams reached his ears he only laughed louder.
 The half-orc ran as people flooded the streets, calling out for buckets and water.
 Too many homes were aflame.
 They could no longer cower within them and hope to be spared.
 In the commotion, Qurrah vanished, unseen and uncared for.
 He had spent his whole life disappearing in crowds, and in the dark of night, surrounded by fear and worry, he was just a shadow.

But I knew from past experience Evelyn would punish me for being here when she happened along.
 Sure, not physically—no elf did that.
 But I could just imagine the way perfect little Evelyn would repeat the story in town.
 Poor Elfreda, sitting alone in the weeds, couldn’t even make grass grow.
 What can we do to help her?
 We should have a Council meeting on it, I’m sure.
 Poor, poor thing.
 I stayed where I sat, forcing my eyes to the ground.
 But then I pictured the smirk on her face as she mocked me to the villagers, to Council, and couldn’t stop the resentment from boiling up.
 My ears rang with it.

We are poised at what can become a turning point in the role of war in human affairs.
 The momentous consequences at stake call for decisive action.
 Historically, war has been a means of territorial expansion and economic conquest that strengthened and enriched the conqueror while draining the energy and diminishing the wealth of the conquered.
 War and economic development co-existed and sometimes complemented each other.
 Technological progress increased defensive and offensive capabilities.
 The demands of war and the associated destruction stimulated greater economic activity and spurred organizational innovation, especially for the benefit of those not directly engaged in the conflict.
 Guns were one of the first products of mass production.
 In the modern era, society has become the principle target and victim of war.
 With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, technology and economic activity in support of fighting forces became an increasingly significant factor.
 As a result, more and more effort was directed at eliminating or crippling the enemy’s economic and industrial capacity and the ‘national will’ to wage war.

 But, you know, I don’t want that out there yet.
 Look what it did to Dylan.
 He didn’t want to finish Tarantula, but, there was so much pressure on him and then someone circulated bootleg versions and the whole thing became uncontrollable.
 I can’t have that.
 I’d rather keep my plans private for now, dig?

“Come on,” Rodregas said.
 “Let’s get to shelter before dark.” As he headed into the hidden hollow the orchard became clear.
 He was sure that at one point it had straight rows and a pattern to it.
 But the orchard had been wild for a very long time.
 While there was a bunch of fruit trees and berry bushes, most were the descendants of the original orchard and it was hard to find anything that reassembled a straight row.
 The apples trees were in fruit and they all started grabbing a few of each to eat as they went.
 Rodregas was not much of a farmer and did not know what the different types were named, but he liked the small green ones with the yellow splotches; they were sweet with a wonderful tang.
 “You know,” said Doi’van, “Hiding on a ley line definitely makes sense for keeping the Immortalists off our back and these apples are delicious.” Rodregas stared at him as he ate.
 Humans ate around the core, but Doi’van was eating the whole apple as he talked.
 “And I love the feel of all the magic.

The requirements of the state and the market must eventually give way to the needs of people.
 The values of authority and money must be supplanted by acceptance of the fundamental value of the human being.
 Human welfare and well-being must become the central determinants of social policy, in place of the compulsions of the centrally controlled state bureaucracy and the decentralized market pricing mechanism.
 The first essential step in that direction is a commitment by market economies to guarantee the right of every citizen to employment.
 Neither the mechanism of state planning and control nor the mechanism of market prices can accomplish this on their own.
 A blending of their values and methods – freed from the blinkers of dogma and the determinism of limited imagination – can lead us to the answer.
 Wider Perspective on Transitions
 The outcome of all great social transformations – of which the present instance ranks in magnitude and importance with that of the French Revolution and the movement which freed India and so many other former colonies from imperialism, economic exploitation and cultural domination – depends on the degree to which individuals and institutions within the society have been prepared to understand, accept and respond to the new environment ushered in by the transition.
 Two hundred years ago the people of France were ready to overthrow the old order but ill-prepared to create anything new, with the result that the old soon re-established itself and lived on for another century.
 It took India’s leaders more than four decades to prepare their people for freedom and it has taken another four to overcome the vestiges of colonial rule that prevented the country from releasing its energies for prosperity.

He thought if he had let her, she would have jumped right on him and slid himself inside her.
 Rodregas knew that Nymphs were legendary for their enjoyment of sex, but he was a little surprised at her eagerness.
 She ran her hands and lips across his chest, seemingly fascinated by ‘his’ powerful musculature and smooth skin.
 Once again Rodregas found himself pulling away from her touch.
 He had never really had a woman that eager to touch him before.
 Her eagerness to touch his body made him feel a little put off.
 It was good to be touched, in fact, he craved it.
 But her eagerness highlighted to him that the body she wanted to touch was not really his.
 It was the body of Gerald, not Rodregas.
 Her body was everything that he had thought it would be, both wonderfully hard and lush.

Lagrimas del Angel always come at too high a cost.
 Nothing so exquisite could be otherwise.
 Please don't despair.
 --@ The hand-drawn symbol on the bottom of the page was so familiar it almost felt like a part of me now.
 He'd saved our house, got Mom a job, and then given me the best birthday present I could've asked for.
 I felt my insides clench and knot, but this time it was happiness that brought tears to my eyes.
 My wavering vision was just up to making out the outline of Rachel's present where I'd left it on the table.
 Feeling incredibly ungrateful and thoughtless, I limped over to the table and tore open the delicate wrapping paper.
 It was a copy of the latest Les Misérables movie, complete with the score from the most recent Broadway production, and a signed picture of the entire cast.
 Mom still wasn't home by the time it got dark, but I went to bed truly happy for the first time in ages.

“No, they’re just gone.” “We’re separated?” she said nervously.
 “Yes,” he replied.
 “What do we do?” “Why are you asking me?” she demanded.
 “You’re the one who comes up with plans.” Emily paced back and forth, trying to think.
 Where were Seth and Jazell?
 Were they okay?
 More importantly, where were they?
 “I don’t know,” she said finally.
 “I just don’t know.” “Oh no,” Jason said nervously.

Then they would hoist the wrapped body onto Harruq’s shoulder and sneak out of town.
 Qurrah sat meditating in a corner while Harruq yammered to himself.
 The blade was in one hand, the decorative scabbard in the other.
 “He was a skilled swordsman,” Qurrah said.
 “He was also arrogant.
 I would expect such a blade from one like him.”
 Harruq shrugged.
 “If I didn’t have my own two swords, I’d use it.”
 The half-orc cut the blade through the air a few times and then sheathed it.
 He turned the weapon over in his hands, marveling at the swimming colors of dark green and black.

“I’m off to town then.
 You know, a handsome hunk of horsemeat was asking about you this morning.” My ears perked up.
 Someone was asking about Chevelle?
 That must have been why we were here.
 And then I realized she had called someone a hunk of horsemeat and I had to stifle a giggle.
 Chevelle nodded, but made no remark on the inquirer.
 Ruby winked at him on her way out and the gesture lit a burn in my chest.
 I turned back to my room and climbed into bed, angry at myself more than anything else, and determined not to let him see.
 I covered my head with a corner of the blanket, suffocating my fractured thoughts with the absence of light.
 I was unsure how long I’d slept.

I asked for Thomas and the person on the phone said, “He is unavailable right now, but tell me what you want and I will get it ready for you to pick up.” It was obviously a cop, and I knew my brother was probably sitting there in handcuffs while they set up every idiot who called for drugs, then collected them like goldfish as they swam into the net.
 I called my mother and told her I thought Thomas had been busted; time would confirm he had.
 Everyone knew what he was doing, including my mother, but she just didn’t want to admit it to herself, and there was nothing she could do to stop it anyway.
 Later, I watched the evening news and saw reporters standing outside Thomas’s house announcing a record cocaine bust.
 Thomas was sentenced to several years in a federal penitentiary in Texas.
 He would have spent far more time if he hadn’t set up his dealer, who was an even bigger fish in the drug world.
 One of the hardest things I have ever done is accompany my mother to Texas to visit her son, my brother Thomas, in prison.
 Over the years I have seen her strive to survive situations no person should ever be subjected to, but this visit crushed her.
 The plane ride there was difficult and we spoke very little.
 The town was a dump of cheap motels and crappy food joints tailored towards the needs of those who visited convicted criminals in this maximum-security prison.

He had never thought he was going to be some powerful mage.
 The fact that Doi’van had so easily learned the spell just reminded him of how many times in his life he had failed to have the ability to succeed in things that he really wanted.
 Rodregas’ new body was very gifted, but it was still mortal and some things he would just not be able to do as well as others.
 In some ways this was reassuring, a connection to his past.
 “Can I ask you a question?” she asked.
 Rodregas smiled and said, “of course, what?” “Have you thought of trying to become a sigil warrior?
 You are a very powerful magician now.
 You could probably take one or even two of the greater sigils and still have more power than you had before, and as a warrior the enhancement from the sigil would make you an even more powerful fighter.” Rodregas nodded, “I have thought about it.
 In fact, I am sure given the opportunity that I would take on one of the greater or several of the lesser sigils.
 I am a warrior first, not a mage.

These are the questions I wanna answer.
 So, like, I remember the whole Wattstax thing—it was all so casual in Memphis.
 It was like, you wanna go, you wanna play with us this weekend?
 No one understood what it all was gonna mean.
 How could they, right?
 How could they?
 Of course, this was while it was spinning out of control for me.
 Slowly spinning out of control, like I could chart it.
 Like I could write it out on a graph—the Venn diagram of how to have a nervous breakdown.
 And the sixties were winding down like a colorful toy that was starting to show its cracks and whose motor was creaky with rust.

 BG:  	You know, Larry co-wrote that.
 CM:  	Larry?
 BG:  	Raspberry.
 As in the Highsteppers.
 We wrote that when I was back in Memphis because my mother was in the hospital.
 Larry came and sat with me in her room—he’s a bloke, man, a true spirit.
 He would come and sit with me, and, while we were watching over her—it was horrible, stomach cancer, and her heart was weak, I thought, shit, we’re losing her—anyway, Larry was there.
 And we wrote that song next to my mother’s hospital bed.
 Strange.

It's the worst possible thing I could do to you.
 If you somehow survive everything that's about to happen, it would leave you forever hungering for another touch, but never able to fulfill that desire."
 I placed a hand on his lips before he could ramp back up to another diatribe.
 "None of that matters.
 All I want is to be with you, and if we're as likely to all die as you seem to think we are, then the state of my mind after you're gone is hardly something worth wasting worry on.
 I accept your invitation.
 As much as I hate the very thought of going to any formal dance, I can think of nothing better than going with you."
 "That's the addiction, the Ja'tell bond talking."
 Now that I knew his concerns, it was hard not to notice just how distracting the feel of his lips under my fingers was.
 Just how pleasant it was to have his hand cupped over mine.

She looked up in shock to see her brother in the kitchen entrance.
 "John!"
 He ran and grabbed her, twirling her around.
 "Where did you come from?"
 "It's a long story."

 "What are you doing here?"
 "Isn't this my home too?"
 He grinned at her.

But although in reality both systems are dead, the ideology of the capitalist system lives on and casts an illusory impression of supremacy.
 Rather than searching for a victor and vanquished, the urgent need is to find a successor that combines and synthesizes the enlightened values of both systems – freedom and equality, liberty and security.
 It has been amply proved that the authoritarian state is incapable of exerting a benevolent authority over the people without imposing severe restrictions on freedom, stifling human energy and creativity, leading sooner or later to rising discontent and a loss of social vitality.
 It is also abundantly clear that money as an institution operating through the free pricing mechanism of the market system – although it does succeed in generating high levels of energy, creativity and productivity – regards people as a purchasable commodity or a potential market, but is otherwise indifferent to human values and welfare.
 Neither the determinism of the state nor the determinism of the market can be adequate in themselves to achieve the goals of peace and prosperity that we strive after.
 It has been generally assumed that the transition now taking place in Eastern Europe will sooner or later lead these countries to adopt forms of government and economy identical to those prevalent in the West.
 But for those raised in a society that offered a great measure of social security, the poverty and insecurity of the Western system are gross inadequacies.
 While it is clear that these new democracies have rejected the authoritarian statist system, it is not yet clear what finally they will accept, discover or invent as a more acceptable alternative.
 The creativity and inventiveness they have exhibited in seeking an alternative in the past may quite possibly lead them to discover that better social system which both East and West are in need of.
 Viewed from an evolutionary perspective, we may surmise the general direction and likely destination of that quest.

The school was narrower than it was long.
 I could walk around the west end, and use the closest doors on the north side, and still have plenty of time to get to my locker before Biology started.
 I was busy replaying my conversation with Brandon as I walked around the corner of the building.
 The air was already hot enough to suck the moisture out of rocks, but that wasn't the cause of the sudden rush of heat to my face.
 I didn't think I'd ever seen the boy before, but Jasmin was easily recognizable, even half-hidden amid all the intermittently-functioning cooling units that lived on this end of the building.
 I couldn't see much beyond the boy's wild red hair, but even that was enough to tell he wasn't completely comfortable.
 I wanted to turn around and go back the other way, but there was a chance that Jasmin had already seen me, and if so I couldn't afford to look like I was scared of her.
 The fact I actually was terrified she was going to snap and start trying to kill people was irrelevant.
 If I could convince her I wasn't scared, I was less likely to get hurt.
 I kept walking, not necessarily steering closer to the three-quarter wall the boy was leaning against, but also being very careful not to go out of my way to stay further away from them either.

 Johnny – Any ideas I have will no doubt be superior to the Canadian Change theory.

 It was funny the first time, but it’s lost some of its charm in each re-telling.
 Jim – It’s not fantasy damn it.

The half-orc shrugged.
 “Sure, why not?”
 Instead of starting, she lowered her staff and crossed her arms.
 “Something’s wrong, Harruq.

 Harruq sighed and looked away.
 He gently tapped his swords together.
 “I don’t know.
 Bored.”
 “Am I not a challenge?”

“It makes me uneasy,” he said instead.
 “But do as you wish.”
 The frailer brother approached the end of the alley where the sound of combat was strongest.
 His steps faltered only once.
 When Harruq moved to catch him, Qurrah glared and leaned against the side of a house.
 When a luckless orc rushed too close to the exit, Qurrah hurled the orb.
 Its explosion conjured shadows and shifting mists of violets and purples.
 The orc collapsed, white smoke rising softly from his tongue.
 In the sudden blinding light, Qurrah laughed.
 “Never,” he said, “could I have imagined it so beautiful.”

He glanced at her.
 "I just wish I was the one you wanted most."
 She caught her breath, covering her mouth with her hand and running from the room.
 Rick hated himself for pushing her like that, but he couldn't seem to help it.
 He was desperate.
 He knew now that he could keep her here, but how could he do that when she wanted so much to go home?
 He ordered Chinese, and Marie came down just after it arrived.
 She saw the cartons and silently went to pour two glasses of tea.
 Rick slid his arms around her from behind.

I had heard my fair share of opinions and criticism of this religion but it just didn’t outweigh the other options.
 “Honestly,” I told Lisa, “I don’t care if he comes out with a shaved head and a pony tail selling incense at the airport, as long as he comes out clean and sober with the ability to deal with his addiction.” She agreed.
 As we put one foot in front of the other, his journey would begin, hour-by-hour followed by a day then a week and hopefully he would embrace the program and discover whatever was causing his self-destructive behavior.
 Early on, I had many phone calls and up-dates from the staff of the rehab center as to Brandon’s progress, some good and most bad.
 He craved this drug and he would say anything to get it.
 He would claim he was in extreme pain and he needed a doctor or anything as an excuse to escape to the outside world.
 These counselors had heard it all before; as former drug addicts they had used the same tactics.
 He was an adult and could leave the rehab center anytime he wanted, but the staff was well trained in convincing him otherwise.
 Everyone I talked to at Narconon had been through the program themselves and were former addicts.
 The young man assigned to our son was wonderful.

These guys were great about showing you the chords, showing you how to use your tuning to get a personal sound out of your instrument.
 I advanced rapidly.
 Soon, I was sitting in with some of them, just playing rhythm, mostly, though sometimes Rooster was so generous he’d introduce me, as his “pro-to-jay” and I would do a brief solo.
 I mean, I was 12, 13.
 And I was playing the blues,  A better education I cannot imagine.
 I started buying all the blues records I could find.
 There were great outlets for records back then.
 Even the flea market at the Fairgrounds had bins of old LPs cheap.
 I started listening hard, man, every night.
 I never did homework.

 In my senior year I only took classes until noon because that is all I needed to graduate.
 I got another job at a local restaurant for the lunch shift as well as any days I was off from the grocery store.
 I realized at an early age that nobody was going to give me anything and if I wanted something I would need to earn it.
 If I didn’t succeed, I wouldn’t survive!
 Somewhere around this time, I decided to try and find my biological father, Richard, a natural thing for a young man my age to want to do, right?
 So I tracked him down and called him.
 Richard was living in Arkansas and had been for many years.
 We talked on the phone and upon discovering he would be near our homes on a business trip, arranged a meeting at a hotel—with Thomas too.
 Thomas begged out at the last minute, and without contacting Richard I brought my friend Bill with me for the drive into the bay area.

She didn't take her eyes off him as he stood up.
 "Make sure your mother tells you what your duties are once we're married."
 He strode out of the house, heading for Mae's.
 Marie stared after him.
 She knew about sex.
 But-but .
 .
 .
 she'd thought it would be something pleasant.
 Was the harshness of his kiss indicative of what sex would be like?

This inefficiency directly impacts on the pace of development.
 Streamlining and expediting decision making and the movement of other social resources is a highly effective strategy for spurring development.
 Comparative scales need to be created to measure the movement of each of these social forces within and between nations.
 Strategies can be evolved to stimulate more rapid overall development by directly acting to increase the velocity of these forces up to ten-fold or even more.
 Progressive Attitudes
 The world we live in today is an external expression of our inner attitudes.
 The world we aspire towards can be realized only by acquiring the attitudes corresponding to those achievements.
 Every political leader knows the power of attitudes.
 Great leaders possess the power to change them.
 Many of those who frankly acknowledge that external limitations such as money and technology are not insurmountable barriers to changing the world erect an alternative myth of inner determinism by insisting that the attitudes of people, and especially their leaders, cannot be changed.

Jim – Just in case the answer was no, and your mom comes back.
 The Boy Scout motto is ‘be prepared.’  I try to live by that motto.
 Liz – You were never a Boy Scout.
 Jim – That doesn’t mean that I can’t adopt their motto, its just good common sense to be prepared.
 Liz – Jim, you’re never prepared for anything.
 Jim – Sure I am.
 Liz – Oh yeah?
 Like what?
 Jim – I’m prepared for you’re mother’s dreaded return.
 Liz – That silly disguise doesn’t exactly count as preparation…

“Harruq, I must ask a favor of you,” Qurrah said.
 He sat next to his brother.
 “Sure thing,” Harruq said.
 “What you need?”
 Qurrah fiddled with the bones in his pouch.
 “There is someone I need you to meet.”
 Harruq raised an eyebrow.
 “The person you’ve been sneaking off to each night?” he asked.
 “You know?” Qurrah asked.
 “Course,” he said, shrugging.

Our mistake was in assuming they meant a physical attack.
 We will not allow them so close again.” “So they’re still following?” Panic.
 “No.
 Not now.” He paused.
 “They have accomplished what they came for.
 Now they will regroup and return.
 Which is why we need to move.” “Why would we leave a fort?” He laughed.
 “Trust me, Frey.
 We have a more secure location.” I must not have appeared convinced.
 “Please,” he added.

Jim – I thought you were just messing with Gene and Johnny.
 Liz – No, you’re playing games, but I’m calling it “Dorks Playing Poker”.
 I like the sound of it.
 Jim – It does have a nice ring to it.
 Do you mind if I take a look?
 Liz – Sure.
 Jim – (walks over and looks at the painting) You got Gene perfect.
 The expression on his face!
 Even how he moves!
 How long have you been working on that?
