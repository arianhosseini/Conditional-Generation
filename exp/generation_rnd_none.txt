 People in those northern states drink beer, watch obsessive amounts of hockey and say Eh.
 All three of those states border Canada.
 Those states have obviously been slowly taken over by advanced Canadian forces.
 Johnny – I suppose that all the famous movie stars born in Canada are really advance scouts for the rest of the army then.

It was a slow song this time, and Alec didn't protest when I abandoned all pretense of actual dancing, and just leaned into him hungrily.
 The reassurance I was seeking was weaker than normal.
 The solid feel of his body was just as permanent as always, but there was no tingle where our skin touched.
 Almost as though sensing my thoughts, Alec hugged me tightly and buried his chin in my hair.
 "I know you don't want to hear this, but it isn't too late for you to change your mind.
 Even now, it'd be a relatively simple thing to have you halfway across the country by the time the challenge actually occurs."
 The thought of what was coming filled me with dread, but I shook my head.
 As scary as all of this was, I knew flying away and never knowing what'd happened would be worse.
 Alec was probably going to die, and all of the rest of us with him, but if he didn't, if the pack somehow managed to survive the coming crisis, I wanted to be there.
 Alec was more than capable of sending me away and then never letting me know he'd survived.

"Right, gorgeous, rich boy who also happens to be the next best thing to a super hero.
 I must be out of my mind not to run for the hills."
 "You don't like it when I spend money on you and the more involved you get with me the less likely it is I'll be able to protect you."
 "If I let you buy me something will you quit trying to scare me off?"
 "No, but it would make me feel better."
 He said that last with his heart stopping blue eyes gazing directly into mine and I nearly stopped breathing.
 Somehow he hadn't realized yet that when he looked at me like that there wasn't anything I could deny him.
 "Ok, you can get me a present, something small and relatively inexpensive."
 Alec smiled and reached over to the backpack as he sat up.
 I let him pull me up and then felt my face freeze as he pulled out one of the largest velvet boxes I'd ever seen.

She was holding it open as if expecting me to fill it.
 I found myself outside the school, sitting on the edge of the parking lot without a clear idea how I'd ended up there.
 There was a vaguely irritating noise behind me that didn't seem to fit with what I expected from school.
 I thought about turning to see what it was, but was thankfully too far back into the gauze to act on the thought.
 I went back to contemplating the pair of ants that were currently trekking across my right foot.
 "Adriana.
 Are you okay?"
 My insides were too raw.
 Just coming out long enough to listen to Mrs. Campbell had opened everything back up.
 My mind tried to shy away, to sink away from the certainty of more jagged shards being shoved into me, but this voice was an important one.

He stroked her hair, smiling at her excitement as she began a fourth game.

 He gazed into her eyes.
 "Marie, I'd never intentionally do anything to hurt you."
 "I know that.

 He frowned.

I sat on one of the swings next to Emily.
 I traced the sticky metal rings and sighed.

 I saw Seth and Jason arguing off to the side.
 Everything was back to normal.
 There was even a dwarf climbing the slide.
 Wait, hold on.
 A dwarf?
 I elbowed Emily in the arm, “Uh Emily, is a dwarf using a slide a normal thing?” I nodded in the direction of the dwarf and her eyes widened in surprise.
 She jumped off the swing and grabbed me by the arm.

The two leaders faced off as everyone else fanned out around them.
 Jasmin, Isaac, and the others all maintained calm exteriors that were markedly different than the eager, often sadistic expressions of Brandon's people.
 "I demand satisfaction on behalf of my pack for the two of our number that you brutally murdered.
 This is within my rights under the laws that bind us.
 I demand two lives for the two lives robbed me."
 Brandon's expression was confident and a little smug, and I somehow didn't doubt in the slightest that he'd expected Alec to calmly hand over two people to be executed.
 Alec hadn't even flinched at the demand.
 "Your wolves were lawbreakers who were executed before they could break further laws.
 The protection of the people, of the secrets that guard our nature from the dayborn, represents a law that supersedes any question of territory or dominance."
 The energy suddenly rolling off of the gathered shape shifters nearly drove me to my knees as Alec continued.

Care to dance?"
 I almost said no, but as he pulled me in towards him, I suddenly realized just how badly I wanted to touch his incredibly hard chest and shoulders.
 Being wrapped in his arms was so pleasant that I didn't even protest when he pulled me in closer.
 My whole body tingled where it touched him, and his cologne, so faint as to be almost imperceptible, was like nothing I'd ever smelled.
 Almost against my will I found myself pressing up against him so I could drink in the scent.
 The music was still way too loud, everyone around us was still ridiculously drunk, but suddenly I couldn't care less.
 Someone tried to come up and talk to Brandon as the next song started, but he waved them off, not even pulling his eyes away from mine.
 I'd thought my heart couldn't race any faster than it already was, but when he started moving his face down closer to mine, it felt like it was going to tear itself free from my chest.
 It was happening.
 I'd fantasized about kissing even back when I thought boys had cooties.

The lead guard, already having their coin as well as the bonus of having found elves in hiding, was willing to let it slide.
 “You draw them, even fiddle with them in their sheaths, you die, that clear?” he told the half-orc.
 Harruq nodded, again saying nothing.
 “Calm yourself,” Qurrah whispered to his brother as the two marched in front of the guards toward the main streets.
 “Trying,” Harruq whispered back.
 They marched at sword point.
 Onlookers cackled as they passed, figuring the two were thieves or vagrants caught brawling.
 Their orcish features lent them no kindness, and a few children even threw rocks until the guards shooed them away.
 The whole while Harruq burned with shame and rage.
 They reached the western gate, which remained open during the day.

“What are these?” he asked.
 “The human alphabet.
 And you’re going to learn it.”
 He protested, but it was a weak protest.
 They went over the alphabet several times until Harruq could repeat most without thinking too hard.
 “I want you to take it home with you,” she said when they were done.
 To her annoyance, Harruq refused to accept the book.
 “I really don’t want to take it,” he said.
 “Why not?”
 “Well I, just…” His face turned a mixture of gray and red.

 Dieredon watched the brothers travel back to Woodhaven.
 He had been waiting outside the town, and in the starlight the swathe of darkness rolling across the land had caught his eye.
 He had followed and from a distance observed the short meeting.
 His eyes flipped between the half-orcs and their master.

The way he’d reacted when Fannie had struck me, the caress against my cheek, those were not the actions of a council elder.
 As we sat so near, it was hard to believe the concern wasn’t real.
 His eyes burned with intensity; they seemed even darker now.
 Dark… like mine.
 I looked away.
 Steed broke in through the trees, gesturing toward the direction he’d come from.
 “They aren’t far.
 Ready and able for a morning adventure.” As he approached, he glanced at me and then Chevelle, still close beside me.
 “We can get an early start.” He lifted a pack from beside the fire and said, “Bluebell?” I stood, following this stranger without question, not missing the irritation on Chevelle’s face.
 He unclasped the pack to roll the blankets out with a flip, smiling and nodding good evening before stepping away from my hastily constructed hut.

Maybe he could have made it, but if he missed it was at least a hundred feet down.
 So he climbed the bark over to the other branch and then walked on the top, which was very easy.
 He followed Imeralda out on the branch until it started getting thin and began swaying.
 Then he sat on the branch.
 He did not know what to do next.
 His body relaxed when he heard Imeralda’s voice.
 “Are you trying to kill me?” she asked, “and are you really trying to rescue a Forest Nymph from a tree?” The laughter that followed was pure and open and even he had to laugh with it.
 “So,” he asked, “what are you doing?” “Well, I decided that if this was a greater sigil I should touch it.
 Even though I do not want a greater sigil to consume my magic, this is the One Tree.
 And well, I am a Nymph.

The tires were the biggest I'd seen on anything outside of a tractor, and the lift kit on it was so outrageously tall that I was pretty sure someone was going to have to lift me into the cab.
 By myself it was going to take a rope and climbing shoes.
 Of course it was black.
 I couldn't imagine Vincent in anything other than a black vehicle.
 Predictably, Vincent was rubbing down his vehicle, but the exercise seemed more targeted to giving him a chance to walk around with his shirt off than it did with cleaning up the already immaculate truck.
 Based on the way the cheerleader types by the garage were watching him, it was working.
 I much preferred Brandon's jeans and tee shirt, tight as it was, over the shorts and shirtless look, but apparently I was in the minority.
 I almost hyperventilated when Vincent casually walked out of the house with a pair of beer kegs and tied them down in the bed of his pickup.
 His house was more on the fringes of town, but it was still in town.
 What if his parents came home and saw them?

The sun hadn’t set when I’d finished lining the floor with vines, but I went ahead and settled in, sitting so I could see through an opening in the frond-covered entry.
 It was quiet, harder to fight the thoughts that were trying to creep in.
 I began to run songs through my head for distraction, mangling the lyrics and humming through the parts I couldn’t remember at all.
 My fingers tapped soundlessly into the dirt, until a flicker of movement just outside stopped me.
 I held my breath for what I was sure was impending, and painful, death, and saw it again.
 I released the breath, which was not, in fact, my last.
 A soft white rabbit loped in front of the bushes I’d posted for a doorway.
 My stomach was interested, but I’d never prepared meat.
 I’d only ever gathered berries and vegetables that someone else had grown.
 I didn’t have the first idea how to make a bow, let alone shoot one, and I’d never killed anything.

 Most everyone will leave in the next ten minutes or so, but we're actually open for another hour."
 She was right.
 Nearly everyone left over the next little while as they either finished up their assignments, gave up, or finally filled whatever quota of study time they'd been given by their parents.
 I did get to answer a couple of questions, which was surprisingly fun.
 When there was only half an hour left Mrs. Campbell walked over.
 "Good job so far.

 Stay here until closing time, and then you're free to go.

Even without a decision to abandon completely their use under any circumstances, a further drastic reduction to somewhere between 20 and 200 warheads is more than sufficient to meet any security need.
 Immediate steps can, and should, be taken to negotiate reductions to this minimum level.
 The relaxation of tensions has drawn public attention away from this issue and reduced the momentum for progress at the very time when there is the greatest opportunity finally to eliminate this threat completely.
 The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which ensures the military superiority of the nuclear powers over other signatories, is an instance of rule by strength forcibly imposed by the major powers on the rest of the world community in the name of peace.
 It is neither equitable nor justifiable.
 Already, 156 countries have signed the treaty, owing either to coercion or indifference, and the number is expected to increase to 170 out of 179 states by 1995.
 The acceptance of non-proliferation by these countries further delegitimizes the continued possession of nuclear weapons by any country.
 All of the treaty non-signatories can be persuaded to sign in exchange for annihilation of these weapons by those that now possess them.
 Under these circumstances, refusal to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty could be considered sufficient grounds for expulsion from UN membership.
 Without a universal ban, the efforts of the nuclear powers to stop proliferation lack moral authority.

 A small bouquet of flowers lay on the bottom of the box.

 “Wanted to thank you for sparring with me,” he said.

 The Danger of Watching Joan of Arcadia
 In Oregon, I’m speeding alongside one of the many wide and glistening rivers and gazing across at concentric rows of emerald hills at intervals topped with lacy clouds when I catch myself admiring them to such a degree I could call it worship.
 Then something reminds me to turn from worshiping the creation to worshiping its creator.
 To adore a feeling or state of mind, such as the revelation of beauty in nature or the way a lover makes me feel, may involve nothing but selfishness.
 But to adore the creator of that feeling, God for creating nature, a lover for giving me a piece of her heart, or parents for providing warmth and safety, that is appreciation, gratitude, untainted by the selfishness that all sin is made of.
 Maybe if I practice this exercise, try to catch myself in each act of admiration, and turn my worship to the creator, I will gradually learn to adore God the father, and God the spirit.

 Thanks Liz.
 Jim – Most of those names aren’t well known, and the people who do know them would die of laughter rather than of fear.

That thought filled her with an astonishing sadness.
 Sadness, not just disappointment over Hollywood—-because she'd miss Rick.
 "Afraid of what?"
 Rick stroked her cheek with his thumb.
 "Hmmm?

 Standing on tiptoe, she kissed his cheek.

He'd stayed home from work to be with her, and he'd held her.
 And he hadn't been upset that she'd broken up with Davis.
 He just wanted her to be happy.
 That was what Rick wanted for her.
 Tears tightened her throat as she remembered the anguish on his face when he'd told her that he was the key to the doorway to 1927.
 He'd desperately wanted to keep her with him, to marry her, and he could have kept his discovery to himself and never told her he knew how to help her get home.
 But he'd wanted what was best for her.
 Hanging the housedress in the closet again, she stripped off her dress and extra set of underwear and put on Rick's t-shirt.
 Curling up on the bed, she stroked one sleeve.
 She wondered what Rick was doing right now.

Despite Britney's best efforts to distract me with a point-by-point analysis of what was going on with someone named Sandra, and the two boys she'd been leading on for the last month.
 I followed Britney through the lunch line, gripping my meal replacement drink with both hands.
 We sat down at our usual table, only to be surrounded a few seconds later by an energetic mob of familiar-looking people.
 It wasn't until Brandon slid into the seat next to me that I realized who everyone was.
 "We thought maybe we'd come join the two of you today.
 That shabby little corner where we always sit was getting a little old."
 Brandon's voice was smooth and flawless as always, but even that couldn't distract me enough to miss the flash of dislike in Cassie's eyes as she sat down next to Britney.
 Nobody talked about anything important, which was good since I couldn't focus on anything other than the fact I'd just been given one more sign, a really big one, that Brandon was interested in me.
 A couple of minutes before the warning bell rang, I looked up from the group and saw another familiar face leaving the lunchroom.
 Everything suddenly dropped into place, and I grabbed Brandon's arm.

The rush of power beat back at our entire pack.
 If it'd been a physical wind it would've knocked me over.
 Intangible or not, it still staggered me and only my grip on Jasmin and Dom kept me from dropping to my knees.
 Alec stood motionless for a pair of seconds, and then seemed to explode and melt back into himself.
 I blinked, and his human body had been replaced with the hybrid form that'd saved my life once before.
 Only this time he wasn't fighting wolves, he was fighting another hybrid, and Brandon towered over him.
 There was another ripple of movement on the other side of the light.
 Jasmin and Dom both pulled away from me, joining the other three, facing outward in preparation for the inevitable attack.
 Vincent's dark form inched slightly closer, but Brandon's growl froze his henchman in place.
 The complete stillness that resulted was suddenly shattered by a flash of heat lightning off to the east, and when the spots cleared from my vision, the two hybrids were a blur of motion.

Evelyn, their mom, kept appearing, offering food.
 Sometime before dark I left and wandered alone, toward and up a hill called Eastridge that overlooked our school, along a street of vacant lots, sometimes escaping into in my usual obsessions about Karen Flagstad or whether I should play baseball or golf that spring.
 But after a moment, the truth returned.
 Nothing that mattered yesterday mattered anymore.
 My gut felt as if a big snake were coiled inside it.
 My heart was a huge lump of coal.
 I walked faster and groaned and wondered why I couldn’t weep.
 I thought of how Eric was ten times the human I would ever be.
 If he couldn’t become Superman, I estimated my chances equaled about the square root of zero.

But, they never talked music, never.
 I would question them about the band, what it was like performing, what particular songs they played.
 They would keep switching the conversation, keep it moving away from music and onto neutral topics like TV shows or the church.
 And, it took me years to figure out what was going on.
 It was my mother, see.
 She thought music was not the kind of career a really useful cog in society’s machine should pursue.
 And she would be damned if her child was going to follow in his father’s footsteps.
 Why I never heard my dad practice at the house.
 Why, even his record collection of big band and swing music stayed dusty.
 My mother squelched my father, I think.

Alec probably expected me to have been totally stumped, but I'd figured out the exact answer to the assignment, and I was so going to show him.
 The glow of satisfaction more than made up for the fact that Britney chattered non-stop on our way to Algebra.
 I felt like I should feel guilty for not liking her, but I was starting to notice how much of her conversation revolved around nasty gossip that made everyone else in the school sound like rejects or sluts.
 When we finally made it to Mrs. Campbell's class, I slid into my seat with a sigh of relief.
 This was the one class all day where I could virtually guarantee I wouldn't be talking to anyone.
 Mrs. Campbell wasn't ever really mean, but she gave off an air that made you absolutely sure she wouldn't put up with any crap.
 We were still working on statistics, which was nice in that I could follow what was being said and wasn't falling any further behind, but kind of a bummer because it meant I couldn't do a bunch of makeup work during class.
 It was a relief when Mrs. Campbell finally capped her marker and turned us loose to work on the homework assignment.
 I was midway through the first assignment when one of the aides slipped into the room and whispered into Mrs. Campbell's ear.
 There was a kind of muted, collective gasp that made me look up just in time to see the color drain out of her face.

 "Why are you telling me all this?"
 Rachel's face tried to take on her liar's mask, but didn't quite succeed.
 "You risked a lot to stop Cassie from hurting me.
 The least I can do is tell you anything I know that could save you from getting hurt in return."
 She was telling the truth.

The sense of terror racing along my synapses was completely irrational, and extraordinarily powerful.
 Just as the room began to spin crazily around me, I felt a gentle touch on my shoulder.
 "Mistress Paige, is there anything I can get you?
 Something to eat perhaps?
 Or if you'd rather, I can show you to the theater."
 I chopped off a hysterical burst of laughter just before it managed to emerge full force and totally embarrass me.
 Of course Alec had a theater in his house.
 Probably a pool and a gym too.
 Along with a half-dozen other amenities I'd never think of, but that the ultra-rich simply couldn't do without.
 I pulled my erratic, pointless thoughts back into a compact, nearly sensible ball, and shook my head as I did my best to give him a genuine smile.

I interrupted right away.
 "You mean when your sister nearly got beaten by that whore, and you not only didn't do anything, you stopped your friends from doing anything either."
 Alec flinched a little.
 I was a little surprised by how satisfying it was to have him, a demigod, on the run, but I didn't let it slow me down.
 "The fact that I, a little waif from out of town, could defuse the situation and save Rachel no doubt sticks in your craw, which explains why you're lurking around out here waiting to talk to me.
 Because only then can you fabricate some reason for why everything had to go down the way it did, and thereby save face!"
 He wasn't flinching now.
 Instead his face had gotten tight and remote.
 For a second it seemed like he was looking right through me.
 "You don't understand."

But I was neither that cold-blooded nor that stuck on Liz.
 She might be as pretty, but if she possessed any goodness like what I saw in Karen, she hid it deep.
 Prom night, for reasons more complicated than I can remember so long, Cliff was driving a '49 Ford convertible that belonged to Bob Williams, whom I will visit in Portland a few days from now.
 Cliff's date was Chris Latin.
 Karen and I rode in the back seat.
 Karen had a cold.
 Maybe her reason for keeping her distance, physical and otherwise, was hygienic concern for my health.
 Or maybe she didn't approve of my dating Liz.
 Whatever the truth, she wounded my already tenderized feelings.
 For a while during the after-prom at a bowling alley, I left her and found Margaret.

The poor old lady that he’d land on would break his fall.
 But what Gene would try to do in real life doesn’t really matter, as that drawing isn’t literal.

 Jim – I also liked the one with all the bright swirls of color on top of that layer of white.
 It’s just seems so cheerful and happy, it really cheers me up.
 You must have been in a good mood when you painted it.
 Liz – That one is called ‘The Storm,’ it’s about my parents’ marriage and all the fights they have all while hiding it from the rest of the world.
 Jim – Oh, well it could have been cheerful.
 Sorry.
 I should have read the title, it was just so bright and happy looking, I gotta learn to pay attention.

“You’d better get started,” he said, “it’s going to be a long walk.” As he kicked his heels, I spun toward the corner where my horse had been.
 He was galloping up the mountain now, just over a hundred yards away.
 I tried to think quickly, to keep the anger from slowing my response.
 Using magic to pull Chevelle’s horse by the tail, I ran after him, hoping to leap on.
 A tree branch came from nowhere and smacked me flat across the face.
 Chevelle’s horse whinnied as they rode away.
 “Why always the face?” I yelled at his back.
 I winced as a second branch, this one young and green and more like a lash, struck me from behind.
 A fierce growl escaped me and I took off, running at full speed in the direction my horse had gone.
 By midday, I was completely spent.

It caused me physical pain to think about Chevelle’s touch, about council, about what was happening, and I knew it was the bonds.
 When Grey walked out, my trance broke and I noticed Ruby by the front window, wearing an odd smile.
 I flushed and turned from her, rolling into a ball on my blankets, remembering no more than the feel of his skin on my neck, the quirk of his lips.
 I had to keep distracted, and there was nothing for it but the book.
 I wasn’t able to find much regarding humans in the study’s library.
 But I had been right.
 Illustrations and descriptions matched what I had seen.
 I know I took a risk extending Rune’s spell further, but I did not want to get caught, definitely not followed.
 I wondered if my sister was still at the original camp.
 Surely she wasn’t bright enough to figure it out.

I don’t think the backup guys were up to it.
 I should have played everything—I almost went back in and re-cut it, but, hell, it’s ok the way it is.
 But, it could have been better.
 Thicker.
 CM: 	“It’s Not True Unless it Makes You Laugh.”
 BG:  	Right.
 That’s actually a really old song—that almost made it onto Turntable.
 I wrote that in Memphis, in Lorelei’s bedroom, right after we had made love.
 There was candlelight dancing on the walls, and outside one of those Memphis thunderstorms that seem like the end of the world, beautiful like the end of the world should be, and Lorelei was lying there naked, a vision out of Titian, and I just started singing those lyrics.
 Those were given to me, you know?

“Canadian Sunset,” “Old Brown Jug,” “St.
 Louis Blues,” “Blues for Allen Felix.”  It was a revelation.
 But, never to be repeated.
 I think I was about 6 at the time, but that hour in front of Dick Delisi and the Syncopators is as fresh in my mind as if it happened yesterday.
 Man, my dad.
 What could he have been?
 Given different times, a different circumstance.
 He said something odd to me one time, he said: “Bud, music is a bad demon to have.
 Like hooch.
 If I could have done anything else I would have.”  And, of course, he did, I mean playing at the Vapors wasn’t bringing in enough money to support his small family, so he did books for a paint store.

“Well, Doi’van, what do you think?” Rodregas asked.
 “I am going to choose lion, but it would be great to have a pride, or maybe the Moon Wolf or the Mountain Bear.” Doi’van nodded and walked over to the bear.
 It was a kind of bear that Rodregas had not heard of in the mortal world, even larger than ‘his’ lion.
 The bear actually had a thick tail and its teeth seemed far larger than any bear he had heard of.
 Doi’van stood there looking up at the great beast for a long moment.
 Then he cocked his head; his nose went up as if he smelled something.
 He stepped around the great bear and headed toward the back wall.
 The score of statues, while separated, were clustered in the middle of the great room.
 The four walls of the room seemed to be set back with the ceiling gently coming down in the form of great arches.
 In one of the great arches was the door they had entered.

 I hope that this book and the website http://www.rxdrugaddict.comcan help addicts better understand that they are not just destroying themselves but also their family and friends.
 I hope they can see that they could have long and productive lives if they chose to feel life instead of numbing it.
 I also hope this can help people to think about their defining moments and to never give up on their addicted loved ones.
 Expecting someone to just stop being addicted is as absurd as asking someone to stop having cancer.
 These addicts need professional help from those who are trained in this field.
 We are ignorant and ill prepared to help and understand an addict and that ignorance could be deadly.
 We can only pray that these addicts can overcome their addiction and start living a clean and sober life one day at a time.

“We can’t be afraid of the competition.
 I may die, but if I win I can earn a greater sigil, maybe even bring you into the chamber as my servant.
 If both Doi’van and I had a greater sigil, we would be much more likely to survive the upcoming battles,” Rodregas said.
 “We would still get spitted like a pig to the roast without decent armor,” said Doi’van, “but as the Gods have yet to provide the armor, we will show these human squires the armor of our faith and the armor of our courage.
 I just don’t like having to watch you fight such battles and not be able to fight myself.” growled Doi’van.
 “Yeah, what he said,” Imeralda stated, ”I wish I could do the bow competition for you.
 I could get you five points there even with a regular bow, otherwise I am happy to watch you big boys show how tough and strong you are.” Rodregas smiled at Doi’van’s and Imeralda’s courage even though their personalities were opposites.
 Imeralda was as light hearted as Doi’van was thoughtful.
 “One question,” Rodregas asked, “do we actually have a hammer or a mace?”
 Two days later the dawn found Rodregas facing his first opponent.

Art – We’ve covered that.
 Jim – Did your dad ever cover what to do in such a situation?
 Art – No he didn’t, most of his advice so far has been geared to identifying women who might give you a chance.
 Jim – No tips on what to do when you have her?
 Art – Nope.
 Dad only ever dated one girl, and he ended up marrying her.
 Jim – What the hell kind of expert on women does that make him then?

“You mean Ruby is your sister?” “Half-sister,” he emphasized.
 He let me roll that around for a while before he spoke again.
 “You know, Ruby told me she’d had dealings with the infamous Chevelle Vattier, but I didn’t believe her.
 One can never believe the tales of a fairy.” Infamous?
 “But imagine my surprise when he walked out of the trees, following a green-eyed beauty.” Steed smiled at the memory and then turned serious.
 “When I ran into the… trackers, I had hope Ruby had told the truth and might know where to find you.” He laughed.
 “She tried to hide you, but I recognized the horses out front.” “She tried to hide us?” “Ah, yes.
 Fairies are full of treacheries and wickedness.
 Always meddling in the affairs of others, causing trouble whenever possible.
 They have quite a time.

Noxious weeds were taking over the meadow.
 As I stood there, frozen before this changed garden, I was overwhelmed by the scene, overtaken by emotion, and had to press my eyes closed.
 Light rain began to fall and I raised my head to the sky, drawing in a deep breath.
 The cool water trickled down my face, calming the heat of my pulse.
 But it didn’t clear my head.
 I still couldn’t understand.
 A painful fear shot through me, and I tilted my head forward to run through the growth.
 Vines, thorns and leaves turned to muddy ash as they touched my outstretched arms, wet with rain.
 When I reached the edge of the onetime garden, I stopped to kneel, digging my fingers deep into the soil to form a trench.
 When I saw the bared roots, black and rotted, I was suddenly exhausted.

I wanted as far away from all of it as possible.
 But I didn’t make it far.
 Exhaustion caught up with me a few miles later and I found an old oak tree, sliding down its massive trunk to rest my aching legs.
 I’d never run so far in my life and my head throbbed.
 I was seething with anger and frustration and the feeling of being ensnared.
 I didn’t sleep.
 I sat, leaned against the tree, like a petulant child.
 I held a hand up and flipped a flame, tossing it up and down, rolling it above my palm.
 I was hungry, but I didn’t eat.
 Too stubborn and angry to go find food, too resentful I didn’t have the magic to bring it to me.

Aurelia shrugged.
 “We’re outnumbered four to one.
 We might win, but we’ll still suffer many deaths.
 If I am needed, I will fight.”
 “No,” Harruq said, running up and grabbing her arms.
 “No, you must understand, you can’t fight.
 You can’t!”
 “Why?” she asked as tears formed in her eyes.
 “I can’t lose you, Aurelia.

 I walked up and pushed him around.
 “Seth, you have to think.
 Kojas did this on purpose, he’s trying to weaken us by splitting us up.
 He wants us to go running to him.” “I know what he’s trying to do, it’s driving me crazy.
 The nerve of this guy.” “Faery,” I corrected him.
 “He’s not a ‘guy’, he’s some demon faery.
 Calling him ‘guy’ makes it sound like he’s just a normal human.” “Does it matter right now?” he asked, through clenched teeth.
 I looked away.

 I tried sidetracking him.
 “Ruby says no one can control animals.” “You’ve been talking to Ruby about it?” Oops.
 “Well, Ruby just talks.” “Mm-hm.” “So, some of the others… who, exactly?” He smirked.
 I’d given too much away.
 “You couldn’t tell by the way they looked at you in the clearing?” I had noticed.

 It brought back a memory.
 “Who was the old guy with the stick?” “Staff.” “Staff.” I waited.

A way to convince yourself that there is some reason for all the pain and humiliation.
 Rather than grasping reality and actually doing something to help the world, people with faith just wait for luck to see them through.
 Ned – What is it we need then?
 Art – All people need is love and happiness.
 That’s it.
 Some happiness you can find on your own, without love.
 Some of the best kind of happiness comes from love.
 Not the distant love of a remote God, but a personal love.
 Love of other people, or love of life.
 How ever you find Love doesn’t matter, because happiness comes with it.

The symbols and geometric figures that form a powerful spell are often too complex to learn from just the spoken word.” Rodregas cut in and clarified, “I mean, in the order we did read books on magic theory and history, but I never felt energy from them before.” Imeralda nodded, “Let me explain.
 First, you have a lot more power now, and power calls to power.
 So, you are a lot more sensitive to the power that the books have.
 But what separates Grimoires from other books is that they are made like the stone walls of these buildings, by Nymphs.
 It is thought that the original reason was simply to have books that would not rot over a period of centuries, but the nymph-created paper and leather can hold a faint imprint of magic.
 “Each time that the sorcerers cast a spell from the book, it lightly engraved the pattern into the paige.
 A mage can sense the previous patterns in the book.
 The ability of such books to show the pattern of the spell means that even a mage who knows a spell by heart can cast it faster by using such a book.
 It also means that such books are much sought after and never given up freely.
 Grimoires are nearly never sold, unless the owner dies.” She paused to make sure they were both following her and then continued, “While the Grimoires are a great tool for quick and accurate casting of a spell, it is even more potentially useful for someone trying to learn magic.

They were nowhere to be seen, but the sights of the village distracted me quickly enough.
 It was so unlike home.
 Night gave the gray stones an even darker appearance, the firelight glinting off their ragged edges like polished onyx.
 Torches lit each walkway and building.
 It seemed late, but several villagers were still outside, loud and boisterous.
 Nearly everyone dressed in black, a few of the men bearing large silver breastplates or wrist cuffs.
 Most wore leather, laced tight against thick, muscled frames.
 Few were thin or as petite as the elves I was used to seeing.
 These were strong, like Chevelle and Steed.
 All had dark hair as well.

That’s what it was.
 I found myself with existential nausea, the kind you wake up with in the morning and it’s all over you like an animal and there’s nowhere to go because the beast is you.
 I often backed myself into a corner and curled there like a fetus, as if covering my balls and stomach were protection, as if I feared some attack of a physical nature.
 This is what the fear does to you.
 It’s totally debilitating, man.
 Nausea can unseat you, can defeat the strongest man.
 And it’s a nausea that is in your blood—your whole body is sick.
 And, you know, looking at it now, I think I was sick like the country was sick.
 I was nauseated for the USA, you dig?
 I took those deaths, that ignominious war, the whole queasy zeitgeist of the times and internalized them.

I laughed and felt the world brighten a bit.
 “You're so annoying.
 You can add that to the list.” “You just love to insult me,” Seth grinned.
 “Is it your new hobby?” “It will be if you keep annoying me,” I fought the urge to punch him again.
 He just rolled his eyes at me.
 He really is the most annoying person I've ever met besides Emily and myself.
 Wow, he was going to have us both beat.
 “I'm sorry to interrupt your playful banter, but are we actually looking for a place in particular or just some random cave?” Emily's annoyed voice asked us from behind.
 “Yes, just a random cave or a place to stay.
 Why?” Seth asked, just as annoyed.

"Goodnight, Rick."
 She gave him a quick smile before slipping into her room.
 Rick's smile had become a frown by the time he was in his own room.
 He wasn't sure this trip was such a good idea after all.
 Sharing her dream was going to make him fall even more deeply in love with her.
 And when she left, he'd be devastated.
 But remembering the excitement on her face as she'd danced with the actor, he couldn't regret it.
 The next day they went to Universal Studios.
 "This is set up like an amusement park," Rick told her as he bought their tickets.
 "So even if it isn't authentic, I think you'll enjoy it."

I couldn’t help either of them.
 I had pretty much given up on Thomas, and I was afraid to give up on Brandon.
 Over the years, Thomas had conned me out of thousands of dollars.
 He had an uncanny ability to put together some huge deal making himself absurd amounts of money and then blowing it all on a high roller lifestyle followed by being completely broke and desperate and addicted to drugs again and again.
 Thomas had also conned or borrowed thousands of dollars from mutual friends and associates, and it was not uncommon for my wife and me to be confronted by angry people in restaurants or public places because my brother owed them money.
 The last straw with Thomas was over Christmas many years back when he became so violent and threatening that Lisa and I decided to not see him or his family again.
 We even told our children that if Uncle Thomas came to our house or ever tried to get them in a car that they were to run to any other adult.
 We did not know what drug he was on or how far he would go.
 When he moved to southern California, we were not faced with Thomas’s problems anymore.
 I crossed him off of my list—the brother who had stood shoulder to shoulder with me through all the moves, the abuse, and so much else.

fun-loving and vibrant, just as the article had said.
 The thought of the article sobered him.
 He loved being with Marie, but he had to remember that she was going back to 1927.
 The closer he felt to her, the more he’d miss her when she was gone.
 "I like this one best."
 Marie had emerged from the dressing room carrying the black and pink suit.
 Rick looked up, managing a smile.
 "OK."  He bought it for her, looking forward to seeing her in it again tomorrow.
 He noticed that she'd bound her breasts again.
 "Listen, Marie, there are a couple of other things I want you to get."

But he did not want to die without taking out the Immortal Guards first.
 If he killed the slavers and the guards, there was a good chance that the slaves could escape.
 If Rodregas and his group died without taking the slavers and guards out, then they would have died in vain.
 Rodregas hoped Imeralda would get away.
 His shoulder jerked to the left, and he guessed that he had been hit by an arrow.
 Rodregas threw himself toward the last guard.
 He blocked the sword blow with his borrowed shield but did not have the angle to avoid a direct impact.
 The sword sliced through the shield and Rodregas jerked his arm back fearing that he would lose it.
 Rodregas managed to get in close and, abandoning his useless short sword, grabbed his opponent’s shield and pulled him in.
 The guard tried to shrug him off, his bearded face looked afraid.

Harruq got out his last potion but could not open it for the shaking of his hands.
 Desperate, he put it down, picked up one of his swords, and shattered the top of the vial.
 He flung the potion back to Aurelia’s mouth, nearly shredding her lower lip on the broken glass.
 More of the silvery-blue liquid poured down her throat.
 Harruq sat there, clutching her hands in his and waiting.
 The seconds crawled slower than the longest of years.
 He didn’t care if anyone came and saw him, not even his brother.
 His tears fell onto her bloodstained dress.
 For far too long, she did not move.
 His heart cried out in agony.

 Marie was too stunned for a moment to move.
 Finally she walked into her father's embrace, glancing at her mother, who simply smiled at her.
 Apparently she'd prepared her father and brother well.
 They decided to leave for Cape Cod two weeks from Friday.

 Her father would kill her if he ever saw her in such a thing, she mused with a smile.

But he was right--she didn't know how to get home.
 Slowly she rose, not taking the hand he extended but following him inside.
 "This is a microwave oven," he told her, patting a white and brown box.
 "It cooks things really fast--it can heat something like rice in less than a minute."
 When he saw her incredulous stare, he opened the refrigerator and took out a bowl of mixed vegetables.
 "Feel."
 She touched the cold food.
 "How does the box work?"
 "Frankly, I'm not sure.
 Invisible waves somehow heat the food from the inside out."

Back in the living room.
 The hat is once again in its place at the front of the stage.
 Character 1 is standing at the front of the stage addressing the audience again.
 Character 1-  Folks, before I begin tonight’s performance, I would like to request that you make any donations that you can spare to the continued operation of this theatre, and to keeping the entertainment you are about to receive at the highest quality as is possible.
 (smiles at ‘someone’ standing over the had with a donation)  Thank you sir, your generosity is greatly appreciated by both myself and these other fine folks in the audience.
 Now without further adieu, let the show begin.
 (begins to sing an off-key rendition of the song ‘feelings’) (Some time into the song, he stops, looks around and runs for the couch, where he picks up the book ‘how it ought to be’ by Rush Limbaugh)
 Character 2- (Comes in and sees Character 1 reading the book) I thought I told you not to read horror stories before you go to sleep, it always keeps you up into the middle of the night whimpering, and I’m sick of trying to sleep with the light on.
 Character 1- (laughs weakly) I only just began a little while ago honey, no worries, I’m not scared at the moment at all.
 (Another weak laugh)  Besides, I’m almost done here, why don’t you go to bed, I’ll catch up in a few minutes after I finish this chapter.

 “Weapons,” he said again, his voice an angry whisper.
 “Nothing more.”
 “If that is your belief,” Qurrah said, settling down upon the grass.
 “But don’t forget the blood on your hands.
 You killed more than I, brother.
 Now leave me be.
 The night has been long, and I need to rest.”
 Harruq let Qurrah sleep in the flattened grass by the fireside.
 As for him, he sat between Aurelia and Qurrah, glancing back and forth between the two.

Rodregas unrolled the blanket on the back of the now mostly empty wagon showing the dozen books that he had saved from Ravenhurr’s library.
 Imeralda reached out for one of the closest, but then stopped as her fingers touched them, as if a spark of lightning had hit her.
 Obviously, she could feel that same power Rodregas had.
 That was interesting.
 She then ran her hand from one to the next until she had touched all twelve books.
 Then, she looked up and her expression reminded Rodregas of some girl who had gotten the perfect mid winter gift that she had been dreaming of.
 “These are not books on magic,” she said.
 “These are Grimoires, several of them of great power.” “Really?” Rodregas said, “I was a squire who learned a little magic, but I really can’t say that I know the difference between a book of magic and a Grimoire.” Imeralda looked surprised and said, “Oh, you guys must depend on the oral tradition.
 That is a hard way to learn.
 The symbols and geometric figures that form a powerful spell are often too complex to learn from just the spoken word.” Rodregas cut in and clarified, “I mean, in the order we did read books on magic theory and history, but I never felt energy from them before.” Imeralda nodded, “Let me explain.

The prognosis in the West, especially in the European Union, is for slow growth during the 1990s.
 The progress of developing countries is impeded by slow growth in the industrialized nations and the collapse of Eastern Europe.
 What would be the impact on the world economy of a rapid recovery and economic expansion in the countries of the region?
 What would be the result elsewhere of further decline in Eastern Europe?
 These questions are of vital relevance to the entire world.
 A detailed study should be conducted under the auspices of the United Nations, OECD or the European Commission to quantify the potential gains or losses to the global economy of rapid or slow progress of the transition in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
 10.Scientific resources: Science has been one of the greatest casualties of the reform programme.
 Severe fiscal constraints have forced governments to reduce drastically budgetary allocations to research institutions, leaving most of these institutions with little or no source of revenues to support their activities.
 High priority must be given to developing a detailed plan for preservation of the scientific research infra structure during the difficult transition period and for restructuring it so that it can be integrated effectively into the emerging market system.
 The drain of talents must be stopped by a concerted national effort to exploit each country's competitive advantage in science by marketing these capabilities internationally, and particularly by linking up with other countries in the region and with developing countries that can most benefit from the region's scientific and technological capabilities.

My Uncle Dan would take us there at night to visit her and she could sometimes sneak us some food.
 We would watch her roller-skating from car to car and back inside to retrieve her food orders.
 Uncle Dan was a hero to us as he was the only consistent male figure in our life.
 The drive up stations at Bob’s Big Boy were filled with a variety of Hot Rods and they were in all shapes, colors and sizes.
 The engines revved and the tires squealed consistently as the parade of cars cruised through.
 It was an exciting place and a formative moment for both Thomas and me, and helped to cement our lifelong love of muscle cars.
 We were so proud of our mother and we loved to tell our friends where she worked.
 Our friends would openly wonder why a mother would be working at all.
 It was very unusual in that time period not to have a father.
 Our friends were puzzled by our missing parent, our working mother, and our home with our grandparents.

It wasn’t a bad start, but I gathered some shrubbery to cover the entryway, the bitter stench of its sharp green leaves giving me a little more security—or at least the feeling of it.
 The sun hadn’t set when I’d finished lining the floor with vines, but I went ahead and settled in, sitting so I could see through an opening in the frond-covered entry.
 It was quiet, harder to fight the thoughts that were trying to creep in.
 I began to run songs through my head for distraction, mangling the lyrics and humming through the parts I couldn’t remember at all.
 My fingers tapped soundlessly into the dirt, until a flicker of movement just outside stopped me.
 I held my breath for what I was sure was impending, and painful, death, and saw it again.
 I released the breath, which was not, in fact, my last.
 A soft white rabbit loped in front of the bushes I’d posted for a doorway.
 My stomach was interested, but I’d never prepared meat.
 I’d only ever gathered berries and vegetables that someone else had grown.

The area under the rental house had been dug out and reinforced to grow indoor marijuana.
 It resembled an escape tunnel from a prison movie.
 None of this was intended for the eyes of a parent.
 I don’t believe mine or Thomas’s place ever looked half as bad, but if I could see the boxing ring, mismatched couches and the hanging roach clip from where I stand now, who knows what it would look like to me.
 We spent the next 12 hours cleaning, hauling and tossing.
 We rented a local storage unit and brought the furniture and clothes there but we tossed out more than we took.
 We filled nearly fifty large black garbage bags of filth and drug paraphernalia and left them for trash pickup in the alley behind the house.
 Most things of value had been stolen or pawned.
 One of these things was the expensive camera we had given him for Christmas.
 It was at the pawnshop.

Transitions should be regarded as social transformations which depend on and result in corresponding changes in the political, economic and other spheres.
 Efforts to guide a multi-dimensional social transition through uni-dimensional strategies, particularly those limited to manipulation of macro-economic policy, are unlikely to yield the anticipated results.
 Even those transitions which are apparently confined to economic activities within a stable political context necessarily depend on changes in social attitudes and in social institutions which can be dealt with most effectively by assuming a wider perspective of the process.
 Clear visualization of the before and after states of transition, the existing system, the goals to be sought after, and a detailed picture of the changes that need to occur in behaviour, attitudes and institutions are necessary for deriving the most effective transition strategies.
 With the knowledge the world possesses today, with the example of many successful nations over the last four decades, and with its highly educated and motivated people, surely the nations of Eastern Europe and Central Asia can abridge the time required and the hardship of lessons learned by trial and error to a few years.
 But this cannot be accomplished by sweeping remedies or hastened by over-eagerness or impatience.
 It will require application of a profound understanding of the process of development and transition.
 We believe that a properly conceived effort to draw on the best available knowledge and experience of other countries can generate a transition strategy that avoids the dangers and pitfalls of the initial approach to reform and puts in place the essential foundations for the new system to function effectively and generate benefits for the people before the dawn of the new century.
 In the preceding chapters we have tried to draw attention to the uncommon opportunities that the world presents at the dawn of a new millennium for the abolition of war and the eradication of poverty.
 None will question the desirability of achieving peace, democratic freedoms and prosperity for all.

"Here's your form, among other things."
 I verified that the top sheet had her signature on it, and then turned to go.
 She didn't let me get very far.
 "From your bewildered expression during class it appears you aren't transferring in from another school.
 I expect most of your other teachers are just letting you pick up from where they are now.
 I'm afraid this class builds on itself, so I'll be testing you on everything we've covered in the past month.
 I'm sure you've got a full class load, but we haven't gotten into anything truly difficult yet.
 The sooner we get you caught up, the better off you'll be.
 Shall we say a month from today?"
 The prospect of trying to catch up, all the while needing to master new material and deal with a full schedule of other classes, was too much.

I huffed and panted while Cliff and Eric bounded as if every stride was downhill, yet for 2.3 miles I managed to keep up and sing along with our chorus of “Waltzing Matilda.” From then on, for us, to be on the beach meant something new.
 Besides tumbling through the waves, watching girls who filled us with trepidation and awe, dreaming of far places and freedom, it meant staring at the opaque sheen of eternity.
 On the Road
 Probably all of us high school seniors worried about the reality that soon we would be on our own, sent out to face a rather scary world.
 For a while, that was Eric’s obsession.
 The atom bomb threat had recently gotten re-stoked when Khrushchev and Kennedy held a stare-down to decide who could launch nuclear missiles from the western hemisphere and who couldn’t.
 At a coffeehouse near the college I would attend, we overheard people talking about Jack Kerouac and the Beat generation, which Kerouac described as all of us who grew up after Hiroshima and consequently understood just how fragile and tentative life was.
 The end of the world was a recurrent theme of these writers who got called the Beats.
 Any second some madman or tyrant could push the button.
 Kapow, our race is a goner.

Art – Well as long as she’s pretty.
 Other wise, well I can’t imagine that he has much self-confidence left.
 Karen – I’ve seen a couple of pictures, she isn’t.
 Art – Stay in Russia and have no foreseeable future, or come to the United States and marry a stranger who just happens to turn out to be a contributor to the growth of the lesbian community.
 I wonder what would happen to the poor man if she decided to go back to Russia as a lesbian.
 Karen – I don’t know, I hope it never happens to him, my family would make his life hell if they ever found out.
 Art – A good reason to stay away from them.
 I haven’t seen much of my family in years, those people are nuts.
 They’re bizarre on the odd days as well as the even.

I could see its haunches tense up, and then it was airborne, hurtling towards me almost faster than I could follow.
 Only it didn't hit me.
 A patch of night had interposed itself between me and the wolf.
 My vision still wasn't up to making out fine details, and everything was moving too quickly to follow.
 The growling seemed to be in three parts now, which didn't make any sense because the patch of night was vaguely man-shaped, if impossibly big.
 There was a yelp as one of the wolves was tossed into the side of the canyon with enough force that I could feel it from where I was lying.
 A shower of sparks lit up the night as the second wolf dodged away from my defender, and then impossibly the first wolf was back and darting in as I heard jaws snap shut on something.
 The black shadow staggered back, nearly falling under the combined weight of its two opponents.
 A second later another yelp was cut short as one of the wolves fell away to lie motionless on the ground.
 My head was throbbing so bad I blacked out for a moment, and missed the end of the fight.

A single explosion can paralyze a major metropolis or contaminate an entire region with toxic material, dwarfing the devastation caused by the industrial accidents at Chernobyl and Bhopal.
 The disruption of trade resulting even from regional conflicts such as the Gulf War or the war in Bosnia, impacts not only on the economies of the belligerents, but also on neighbours, trading partners and global economic performance.
 Neither the victor nor the victim can any longer afford to resolve conflicts violently.
 Political states may still be able to survive wars, but developmental achievements can not.
 So long as the benefits of development are confined to one or a few sections of society, the costs of militarization and war may not prevent economic and social progress.
 But when the need is to fulfil the rising expectations of the masses by extending the benefits of development to the entire society – thus enabling the society as a whole to move to the next higher level of collective affluence and fulfilment – every social resource must be garnered and harnessed for this purpose.
 The colossal cost of armaments and the catastrophic destruction of war are incompatible with the achievement of prosperity for all.
 Peace has become the fundamental imperative for development.
 War as an Instrument of Policy
 Humanity has lived with war for so many millennia that it is difficult to imagine a world without it.

Oh.
 Nothing."
 Standing on tiptoe, she kissed his cheek.
 "I'll go change clothes and be right back."
 She wished she could wear her sneakers, she mused as she roamed through the garden in her bulky black shoes.
 But she couldn't very well walk into her house wearing shorts and sneakers.
 She did, however, have on black lace underwear that she'd gotten at the mall.
 No one would know about that, and it would be a reminder of her adventure in 2011.
 She wandered full circle and, for the first time, wasn't disappointed when she saw Rick's fountain.
 He stood up when he saw her, and she walked into his arms.

Historically, the free market evolved over centuries in conditions of surplus production and stable currency, neither of which exist in Eastern Europe today.
 Efforts to accelerate the development of the market will have first of all to meet the political, legal, social and economic conditions historically required for its creation.
 And these conditions must be met simultaneously.
 4.Macro-economic stability is a precondition for increasing production: It is extremely difficult to increase production in a context of general macro-economic instability and hyperinflation.
 The rapidly falling value of local currencies minimized their utility as a medium of exchange.
 Agricultural as well as industrial enterprises seeking a stable medium in which to hold their wealth increasingly resorted to hoarding marketable, non-perishable commodities such as food grains or converting local currency into foreign money wherever possible.
 This was particularly devastating for agriculture, where higher production was desperately needed to meet consumer demand and reduce dependence on food imports.
 The breakdown of the local currency as an effective medium of exchange was accompanied by an unfavourable shift in the terms of trade between agriculture and industry, resulting from the near-monopolistic position both of the suppliers of farm inputs, especially fertilizers and farm machinery, and the processing units that purchased farm produce, such as dairies and meat processing plants.
 Together, these factors precipitated a rapid fall in farm production and food availability.
 There can be no solution to the food problem without first establishing a stable medium of exchange.

She will always know where you are.
 And my guess is if you are open to the bond, you will be able to know where she is.
 But, there are also deeper implications.
 The mating bond is one of the great sources of power for the AElf peoples,” he said.
 Rodregas did not understand fully what Jordaan meant but he suddenly added, “Then, if Imeralda is bonded to me, she will always try to keep her connection with me?” He asked a question, but he thought he already knew the answer.
 Jordaan nodded.
 “She will love others, but she is bonded to you for all time, until one of you dies.” Rodregas sat quietly, stunned by the news.
 No more words passed between the two until Jordaan was about to leave.
 “Do you know where the weapons are from the Immortal Guards?
 We are going to need them if we are going to do better during our next encounter.” Rodregas was getting his mind back to business; the news that he would never truly be separated from Imeralda revived his spirit.

 In Sometimes a Great Notion, Joe Ben used to be, as a teen, so handsome and so enthralled by girls, he never could have stayed true to any one of them.
 But a motorcycle crash disfigured his perfect face.
 Still, his girlfriend sticks by him.
 She becomes his wife and the mother of his kids.
 And Joe Ben comes to believe that God had allowed that tragedy to save him from the fate of his father, who died a lonely, sex-obsessed drunk.
 Joe Ben is the book’s endearing and admirable character, a humble Christian of supreme courage.
 A vision, I believe, of what Cassady could have become had he overcome his demons.
 So, I sit on my porch and dream myself back to the morning when Cliff and I woke up in a Tijuana riverbed.
 Instead of what happened, I tell Cliff I’m going on the road to find Kerouac.

The other hybrid, the gray one with his teeth showing and just the barest hint of a growl had to be James.
 Jessica was obviously the smallest of the wolves.
 She paced back and forth, her eyes never leaving me as she made it entirely evident she'd like nothing more than to give into countless millennia of instincts, and just rip my throat out in a single lightning-fast bound.
 It wasn't until I tried to decide which of the two remaining wolves was Dominic, that I realized the next smallest figure wasn't a wolf at all.
 The pitch-black shadow that padded towards me was some kind of cross between a leopard and a jaguar.
 A low growl rippled up out of Alec's throat as the large cat got closer, but she dropped to the ground and rolled onto her back.
 I started forward, but Donovan's hand closed around my arm, pulling me up short.
 Alec's gaze never left the prostrate shape shifter.
 He let her remain on the ground for several seconds, and then his chin dropped in an unmistakable nod.
 Moving with what had to be exaggerated care for someone capable of such speed, she rolled back onto her paws and crossed the remaining distance between us.

She was suddenly the old Rachel I knew from school instead of the confident young woman who'd helped face down three terrifying shape shifters intent on sending me back to Brandon.
 "Are you sure, Alec?
 I could go help her get settled into the Lilac Room."
 Alec's smile was gentle.
 It reminded me of how Mom looked when I offered to take care of some especially undesirable duty she'd been procrastinating.
 "No, Mother's still the mistress of this house.
 We've waited too long as it is.
 If we don't take care of it now it may be another week or two before we have a chance, and Donovan will be severely disappointed in both of us."
 They were both smiling now, as if at some shared joke, but that didn't help defuse the sudden feeling of nervousness sweeping through me.
 Rachel followed us down a series of corridors, and then waited as Alec knocked on a plain, oak door.

The exterior of the building had been impressive, complete with statues and sculptures reminiscent of an eighteenth-century opera house, but I hadn't expected the illusion to hold once I passed through the enormous, gilded doors.
 I'd been wrong.
 The floors were a gorgeous marble which drew the eyes to the nearest golden-white wall, and up the elaborate gilded trim towards vaulted ceilings.
 It was like walking into a palace, complete with painted, spun-sugar clouds, and burgundy drapes made out of rich velvet.
 If it wasn't for the press of people pushing me from behind, I probably would've stayed in the front entryway right up until the sound of the orchestra filtered down to me.
 As it was, I only got a few hurried looks before being rushed along with the rest of the students.
 Seeing all of my classmates looking utterly bored as they allowed themselves to be herded through the most amazing building I'd ever seen brought me back to my original train of thought.
 I hadn't actually spent every waking moment thinking about Les Misérables.
 A fair number of those seconds had been spent with Brandon.
 He'd already been picking me up from school every morning and dropping me off most days.

 How does that work?
 Ned – When you realize that Jesus loves you, you will know that all of life’s problems can be overcome by faith in God, that is how it helps.
 And if you take Jesus into your heart, then God will know that you are ready to receive his help and you will be saved from hell.

Eric was superman.
 Strong, handsome, understanding, considerate, creative, vital, and brilliant.
 It was Eric who brought home Bertrand Russell’s Why I Am Not a Christian.
 My preferred reading was stories, but Eric wanted to commune with great thinkers and then talk about them, to explore ideas together, in hopes we might discover the meaning of life.
 As winter approached, we sat by the fireplace and took turns reading out loud.
 We admired Russell’s smug attitude, the gall of a fellow who accused Christ of utter arrogance for counting people vipers simply because they disapproved of his preaching.
 We delighted in Russell's arguments that Christianity was the principal enemy of moral progress in the world.
 Dismiss Christ, trust ourselves, we would discover the solution.
 Simple.
 After a couple of Russell’s books, Eric brought home Thus Spoke Zarathustra, by Friedrich Nietzsche, a strangely enchanting poet.

Building Social Organization for Development
 The achievement of peace, food security and full employment cannot be accomplished without more fully utilizing one of the most creative and productive of all human resources – organization.
 The march of humanity is marked by the development of larger-scale, more complex and more efficient types of organizations to serve higher and wider social needs.
 Advances in the technology of organization, as much as advances in the technology of production, have been responsible for global progress during the present century and, especially, during the post-war period.
 We have argued earlier that establishment of effective and lasting peace requires a radical restructuring of the existing institutions for global governance.
 Unless and until the UN comes to embody in its own functioning the principles of representative democracy, it cannot hope to play a leading role in maintaining peace and freedom in the world.
 As government and political leaders know only too well, an organization with responsibility but without authority is doomed to failure.
 Unless UN member states invest international institutions with the necessary authority and meet their financial commitments to support them, the world will continue to drift and flounder, powerless to oppose petty dictators and ruthless aggression.
 Unless a cooperative world military force comes into existence, every country will continue to be burdened with the enormous expense and insecurity characteristic of the old system.
 Perhaps more than any other institution, the military has under stood and demonstrated the enormous power of organization to accomplish a goal.

I shouldn't have been surprised when she turned out to be right.
 The new chapter was on probability, which had absolutely nothing to do with the stuff they'd been working on the week before.
 I quickly decided I didn't like the new stuff as much as what I'd been studying on my own, but it was relatively easy, and almost before I knew it class had ended and it was time to go to lunch.
 My doubts about whether or not everyone would be back in school today after three nights of partying were quickly resolved as Britney and I tried to fight through the ridiculous foot traffic on our way to our lockers.
 By the time we made it to the lunch room, I was heartily sick of dodging jocks with shoulders the size of an ox.
 Why on earth did every single one of them think it was necessary to mock fight, throw balls back and forth to each other, or otherwise make a spectacle of themselves?
 My mood was further soured as we arrived to find an unmistakable circle of bystanders signaling an impending fight.
 My first instinct was to go find a teacher before the two idiots hurt each other, but while I was still looking around to see if there was an adult in the room, Britney grabbed my arm and pulled me towards the circle.
 It wasn't until we got closer that I realized there was something wrong with the circle of kids surrounding the combatants.
 Normally everyone pressed in tight for the best possible view.

Rodregas pulled his thoughts back to the roof.
 He would only have one shot at this.
 In a fair fight no mortal was a match for one of the Immortalists.
 “Luckily,” thought Rodregas, “I have no intention of playing fair.” The two female Dire Cats that had been used to lure the Celestial Lion to the tower had fascinated Rodregas since Ravenhurr, at the expense of a very large part of his fortune, had been able to purchase them from the Immortalist Guild dealer Taiga.
 When Rodregas looked into their eyes he had seen a greater understanding than that possessed by mere animals.
 When they growled, it felt like the earth trembled.
 When Rodregas had seen the Dire Cats in their cage he had not been able to imagine a more powerful lion.
 The Celestial Lion was simply breathtaking; almost twice as large as the Dire Cats and even more powerfully built.
 It was not simply size that set him apart however.
 It was a way of moving, a grace that spoke of perfection.

The man was covered in sweat and was surprisingly old.
 He was clearly alive, if unconscious.
 A few young squires ran out and helped to drag the man to get medical care.
 Rodregas’ next opponent followed in like manner, though he got up and gave Rodregas a second round.
 Rodregas circled around to Doi’van who held his spare shields and the provided lances.
 “This next one is wearing full plate armor, but it is steel.
 If you can take him down you should be in the top ten or fifteen,” Doi’van said.
 Rodregas flexed his shoulders.
 He had the physical power of a Celestial Lion, but blows from mounted lancers had the power to hurt.
 “I think I need to change shields,” he said.

 The faery's eyes rolled upward and he went still.
 I wiped my knife on my pants and sheathed it.
 I ran over to Jason, who was crouched over the unconscious Seth.
 Jason looked up and I saw his face was full of concern.
 “Can you help Emily, she's trying to release the trapped dragon,” I whispered to him.

The moment had seemed insignificant in the course of things.
 I laughed at myself as it dawned on me that I probably could have simply made it stop singing.
 And the frog that had exploded on my white gown—I had been there for a mere instant.
 Their minds were so small, so simple, it was like nothing.
 The horse was different.
 It was watching for predators, concentrating on the path, its steps, carrying a load.
 I tried to find another animal to experiment on.
 Our group wasn’t exactly small or quiet, so I was sure we’d scared most of the larger animals off.

Then, true panic set in and he tried to fight his way free.
 Something was wrong, the greater sigil was not becoming part of him, he was being made part of the sigil.
 Maybe these were not like the Celestial sigils at all but some kind of Infernal trap.
 He choked, as instead of breathing air he felt liquid enter his mouth and pour into his lungs.
 He was drowning in the beast!
 He had to get out or he would die.
 He was unable to move and unable to breath and was trying to do anything to live.
 His panic faded into anger.
 If he was to die, he would die fighting.
 Rodregas roared his defiance for the Infernals to hear.

Changes in values, attitudes, structures and policies will be necessary.
 Unless concerted action steps are taken, global unemployment will increase by 130 million during the 1990s.
 Our thesis is that there is a great deal that can be done to prevent this outcome and even reverse the trend, leading to sharply reduced levels of unemployment and progressive eradication of poverty over the next decade.
 How can we make such an optimistic prognosis in the face of the rising number of unemployed and rising concern of governments everywhere?
 Before presenting our case, it is necessary to challenge several basic concepts about job creation and unemployment.
 Destroying Myths about Job Destruction
 Two common, but pervasive, myths have gained ground that add an aura of scientific determinism to the fatalism regarding rising un employment: the first relates to technology, the second to trade.
 The notion that science and technology will eventually eliminate the need and, consequently, the opportunity for human productive labour has been gaining ground since the early years of the Industrial Revolution, and, with the advent of automated production lines, computers and industrial robots, it has attained the status of accepted truth.
 Each generation welcomes with foreboding the advent of new technologies, attracted by their potential benefits and frightened by the immediate costs they impose.
 But contrary to popular conception and empirical observation, there is little evidence to support the thesis that technological development is responsible for rising levels of unemployment in the medium to long term.

Unencumbered, the horde of dead marched out to where the necromancer extended his arms to embrace them.
 Harruq and Qurrah watched until the sun rose in the east and all trace of the necromancer vanished.
 “What is it he wanted?” Harruq asked, breaking their long silence.
 “More dead for his army,” Qurrah surmised.
 “No,” Harruq said.
 “With you.”
 Qurrah nodded, knowing he disrespected his brother to think he might not have noticed.
 “He wanted my name,” Qurrah said.
 “I did not give it.
 I have served a master once.

 Black Lung was playing, one of our first headlining gigs, I think.

 Eugene – What do you want me to do about him?
 Johnny – Why not report him to the police?
 Eugene – I don’t think that would solve anything.
 Johnny – Why not?

 And that he wanted those aliens arrested and sent back to Mars because they were in the country illegally?
 Johnny – Yeah, so?
 Eugene – They have a picture of me posted in all of the local police stations.

I'm not feeling well."
 "What's wrong, darling?"
 "I-I just have a headache."
 At home Mrs. Tranton handed Marie some aspirin and a glass of water and suggested she go to her room for a nap.
 Marie went upstairs but didn't feel like lying down.
 Instead, she sat on her bed with her back against the headboard and her arms wrapped around her knees.
 Why did she feel so frightened?
 This was almost how she'd felt when she'd wandered into 2011.
 But then she'd been in a strange place; now she was home.
 She should be ecstatic.

I never offered advice to any parent, and I never welcomed a statement about raising my children that began with the words “you should.” I have always tried to be the best dad I could be, because it was up to me to make their upbringing different than mine.
 I coached their soccer, baseball and football teams for many seasons.
 I walked my boys to school, helped with their homework (as much as I could) and I tried to be an important part of their lives as well as a positive influence.
 As I continued to succeed in business, our lifestyle improved.
 Throughout their childhoods, we’ve had a good life and a beautiful home, nice cars, good communities, and the best of schools.
 I encouraged their interests by making sure they had the equipment they needed to pursue them.
 For instance, when Brandon showed a real interest in and talent for photography, he received his dream camera for Christmas.
 I have loved my wife and I have shown my children that I love them.
 The boys have witnessed firsthand what a healthy spousal relationship is and that was something I never saw in my childhood home.
 I always believed in teaching my children to respect all people in all walks of life.

I shook with sobs and a pair of arms wrapped around me, supporting me as my limbs became heavy, my body and mind spent from the stress or whatever trauma the spell had caused.
 I couldn’t say which, because I was pulled from consciousness into a black, dreamless sleep.
 Chevelle was still holding me when I woke in the late morning.
 I wondered if he’d slept at all.
 Cradled in his arms, I reached up to rub my bleary eyes.
 As I glanced up at him, it struck me how close we were.
 My hand dropped from my face to fall against his chest.
 That didn’t help.
 Heat rose in my neck; I could feel the corded muscle beneath his shirt.
 I had to look away.

But I remembered reading the human lifespan was very brief.
 I’d have guessed ten times that number if he were an elf.
 “Why the hint of embarrassment?” “They tell me I should have a family by now.” “You have none?” “A mother and father but none of my own.
 No wife, no children.” “You are expected to have a wife and child after just two decades of life?” He laughed for some reason I could not see.
 “Then you have no family of your own?” “I am not expected to pair for quite some time, if ever.
 And children?
 Ha!” He was visibly perplexed so I kept talking.
 “I have a family as well, though my mother died recently.” Sadness washed his features.
 “I’m sorry.
 Was it an imp?” “No.” I laughed at the strange idea.

He was a student at Harvard during the year, and he was planning to be a doctor.
 We were inseparable from the moment we met.
 We went out to dinner, went to parties, sometimes just sat quietly reading together.
 But best of all, we would walk or sit on the beach for hours talking.
 He was wonderful, and I loved him with all my heart."
 She paused, smiling as she reached out to touch a lock of Marie's hair.
 "Every time we kissed, I felt it all over."
 Marie's eyes flew to her mother's.
 "Why didn't you marry him?"
 Mrs. Tranton's face sobered.

“Every one of them,” he said, his hand clutching his bow so tight his knuckles were whiter than the moon.
 “They slaughtered even those that fled.
 Yet there are no corpses.”
 The corpses had been taken.
 Or made to walk again.
 “The man with infinite faces,” Dieredon concluded.
 Another thought came to him.
 “Or was it you, Qurrah Tun?”
 He raced back to Woodhaven, his mind decided.
 It was time he had a talk with one of the brothers Tun.

As he opened his eyes he was also alarmed to see Captain Poir looking down at him with a confused and worried expression.
 Captain Poir said, “Master Ravenhurr?” It was a question.
 Rodregas wondered why his captain would think he was the Master.
 And then suddenly it all rushed back to him, all the details of the final ceremony.
 “Oh my gods he had burned!” Rodregas thought in alarm.
 He quickly raised his hand to his eyes, but instead of his scarred, wrinkled hand that should have been seared by burns; there was a powerful smooth hand.
 Rodregas reached up and touched his face.
 “Dear Gods,” he thought in amazement, “the trigger words had worked.” He had done what he had learned to despise and hate most of all; he had switched into the body of an innocent man.
 “I am an Immortalist,” thought Rodregas in dismay.
 It had been his only shot at survival, and the young man had already been dead in all ways that mattered, but still it was an act of incredible repugnance to him.

For the individual, development involves acquisition of greater know ledge, more progressive attitudes, improved skills and higher values.
 For the collective, development involves establishment of more useful and productive institutions, systems, organizations and cultural values.
 The conventional view that development is essentially a function of scarce economic inputs must give way to the perception that the opportunities and potentials for rapid development far exceed actual achievements in every country.
 Looking back over the past few decades, we realize that the speed of social progress could certainly have been much greater than it was.
 The tremendous potential for accelerating development is most easily illustrated by in stances in which actual achievements substantially excelled expectations, such as the enormous leap in world agriculture during the 1960s and 1970s and the phenomenal growth of incomes, employment and exports in East Asia during the last ten years.
 These unforeseen accomplishments reflect the magnitude of potentials that these countries possessed but had not previously utilized.
 The untapped resources of the society can be categorized under several headings:
 Knowledge of the process of development and the factors that stimulate it.
 Education that imparts progressive social values and practically useful perspectives.
 Information that creates awareness of opportunities.

He found it was holding a purple silk purse containing eight pieces of gold and two of silver.
 Now he had the money he needed to be on the run.
 After forcing himself to wait until the last visible person left the main gate, Rodregas grabbed the trunk and went to the stairs.
 He listened quietly, and hearing nothing, he set the trunk down and quietly walked down the stairs.
 The next floor housed the laboratory.
 The door was locked and he did not want to break it down until he was sure everyone had left.
 The next floor down was the main floor; He stepped out to the main hall and listened.
 He heard nothing but his stomach rumble; he was very hungry and knew that he should eat.
 He was already in the main hall; the room to the right was the kitchen.
 He stepped into the kitchen but then came to a sudden stop.

The village was crowded with elves, oblivious to my horror.
 The protection spell must have only alerted council.
 I ran from town and pushed through the brush at the edge of the village, taking the shortest direction out of the boundaries.
 I kept running until I became winded and then hastily searched for some kind of shelter.
 Burrowing deep in a briar patch, struggling to catch my breath, I wrenched the wad of papers from under my shirt, buried them in the soil beside me, and then waited for my punishment to come.
 But no one was coming.
 I was naïve to think they would chase me like hounds on a fox.
 They had magic—they were High Council.
 I stayed in the patch of briars for most of the day, cowering despite myself, but as the sun lowered in the sky, I crawled out on my belly to start the long walk toward home.
 It was late by the time I reached the tree and I was tired enough I didn’t care as much about being caught.

I followed just 13 months later, and another brother was born 14 months later and died almost immediately after his birth.
 My mother at 20 years old had two toddlers and had to accept the death of her third baby.
 Years later, I returned to this town and located the home we first shared.
 The home, which had since been converted into a one car garage, still had the old front door located next to a single car garage door that had been put in place of what was once the front window.
 It seemed impossible that it could have ever have been anything but a garage.
 Chapter 3: The Set Up The lights of another car coming over the bridge do not belong to either vehicle I am expecting, so I examine the occupants.
 It is a man and his wife about my age so I look away quickly as to not draw attention to myself.
 I know I’ve got to wait patiently, as this drug deal is important to me and my family.
 I need it to happen.
 Another thing hasn’t changed about drug deals in all the years since my last: Buyers are always late to arrive and usually short on cash with lame excuses throughout the process.

I should have prevented this.” Regret was thick in his voice.
 I could only stare at him, mystified.
 He explained, “It’s too late now.
 You’ll never rest until you’ve followed the map.” He was wrong; I’d forgotten my plans, surrendered to my captor.
 I had thought it was over.
 “Yes,” I answered boldly, the word echoing with the thrum of my pulse.
 It made no sense, but I didn’t take the time to think it through, didn’t give him a chance to change his mind.
 I smiled, kicking my heels hard into the horse’s sides.
 The animal jolted forward.
 I gripped the saddle with all my might as its hooves cut the earth.

Brandon's normal smile was back.
 "Yeah, Adriana noticed it almost as soon as we pulled up to the school."
 Her suspicions that Brandon had given me a ride into school satisfied, Britney managed a sickly smile and mumbled something about seeing us later as she disappeared around the corner.
 I managed to make it another twenty feet before I couldn't restrain my laughter anymore.
 Brandon joined in with a chuckle that was more restrained, but no less heartfelt.
 We both wound down about the same time, and I wiped a tear off of the corner of each eye.
 "I should feel bad for laughing at her, but she's so transparent.
 It's nice to see her served with a little justice."
 Brandon nodded with a smile.
 "It's a little ironic.

 Woodhaven is in danger, and so are you.”
 Aurelia stepped back, frowning.

Outside of what we bring, there will not be much.
 But it will be a good place to rest and…” he said gently patting his stomach, “heal up.
 We should be there by nightfall.” “Not bad,” said Imeralda.
 “Sounds like a place that will be hard to find, but is this not territory infested with wild Dire beast?” “Yup,” Rodregas said, “another reason I think this area is usually hard to find; most people stay clear.” He continued after a pause to let them think of entering territory known to be the hunting range of feared predators, “I never saw any sign of any Dire beast in the hollows when I was there, but, of course, they probably know of the place.
 Still, I would rather handle a pack of Hellhounds than The Immortal Guards.” Neither looked pleased at his logic, but both nodded.
 A few hours later it was starting to get dark as Rodregas recognized the spot and turned the wagon left for the final hard assent.
 At this point there was no trail, and common sense would have argued against the path.
 It was hard work.
 The horses had to be hand-led around rocks and trees and pulled up.
 Doi’van and Rodregas had to manhandle the wagon around a few corners which was easier to do than it should have been, but Celestial and Hellborn strength together made short work of it.

I examined him closer, taking his hand and turning his arm.
 The inside of his wrist was lighter still, close to the shade of my own skin.
 I was still studying him when he spoke softly.
 “May I kiss you?” His breath hit my face; I hadn’t realized how close I had gotten.
 It surprised me, as did his request.
 I had a perverted desire to let him.
 I smiled thinking of it.
 He took that as an invitation, leaning closer, his hand raised to touch my face.
 His thumb caressed the line of my jaw as he reached around, fingers tangling in my braids as he drew me to him.
 He started gently, teasing, and then crushed our lips together, his strong hand holding me there, his breathing ragged.

The intention was to make Steve believe that Brandon was still using, and thus trustworthy.
 Brandon was a nervous wreck.
 He was completely confused after days of detox and scared to death that he was going to prison if the scheme failed.
 Brandon contacted the other drug dealer from his own cell phone so Steve would recognize the number.
 Brandon told Steve the concocted story and then supplied Steve with the phone number that Officer White had given him for the phony buyer.
 Immediately there was trouble: The officer had accidentally given Brandon the same phone number that Steve already possessed; the same number that had been given to Steve by the same officers for his use when he was setting up a bust of his own.
 Brandon was outed big time.
 Our son was immediately labeled a snitch on the street and had no chance of helping the police.
 Our phone began ringing with crank calls and threats on his life and ours.
 The officers were apologetic; it was apparently an honest mistake.

 As much as I'd rather stay here and bask in your beauty, it's time for more training."
 I tried to keep the disappointment from my face, but his expression fell a little despite my best efforts.
 "You're unhappy with me?"
 "No.
 I mean not really unhappy, at least not with you.
 Maybe with the situation.
 I just feel left out of everything that's going on.
 I know you don't want to get me any more deeply involved with 'dangerous information', but it really sucks sometimes."
 Alec gazed at me for several seconds, and then sighed.

I in fact happen to know that you're in a band that performs occasionally down in Vegas, so don't go trying to pull a fast one on me."
 Albert looked genuinely startled, but recovered quickly.
 "Hey there, idle, profoundly-untrue comments dropped by Mrs. Campbell in passing conversation don't count.
 I'm absolutely not a member of Fatal Angst."
 "Yes, you are, at least you are until I either decide to dispose of your body, or let your little secret out of the bag because you're not doing your job."
 I hadn't heard Mrs. Campbell approach from behind me, and for a second worried she was really angry, but the way Albert chuckled as he cringed in mock fear alleviated my concerns.
 Albert pushed his glasses a little ways back up his nose, and then wandered off to help the next person with a red card face up on their desk.
 The number of people who proceeded to come into the tutoring lab was nothing less than amazing.
 Based on overheard conversations, it sounded like there was a perfect storm of tests.
 Both of the other math teachers were apparently having tests in every single one of their classes, and Mrs. Campbell was having tests in a couple of hers as well.

We know that neither Hellborn nor Nymphs are usually allowed in.
 In that case there might actually be another room behind the forth wall that we simply don’t have a connection to and therefore cannot sense.” The others nodded.
 Rodregas thought that they were heading along the right path.
 Imeralda asked, “Does that mean that in this room these are great sigils as well?
 Ones that require Infernal sourced magic to work?
 That kind of makes sense if you can have greater sigils that are the shapes of the Celestial Beasts.
 Why not daemons of the Infernal Realm as well?
 But what is the One Tree?
 It is not a beast of a realm, it is the symbol of the Nymph people.
 It can’t be a sigil, can it?” she asked.

Some hit their mark, which was signaled by the creature roaring out in pain, others fell into the dirt.
 Emily danced close to it, spinning fire from her fingertips.
 The creature raised a leg and swatted at her but she just twirled away.
 The stinger narrowly missed Seth, and I saw him stumble back in surprise.
 He swung his sword at the stinger.
 It sliced through and the creature screeched so loud I was afraid everyone would hear it.
 The stinger fell on the ground and dark blood oozed from the cut.
 “Now Jazell!” Seth yelled to me.
 I notched an arrow and took aim at the thrashing belly.
 I pulled the string back and released it.

He actually dodged Jess' jump, causing her to latch onto nothing more than thin air, while he spun around and hit James with a blow to the chest that had to have broken ribs.
 "Alec's a good leader.
 Maybe the best.
 This kind of exercise would be impossible in nearly any other pack, but it's the only thing that's kept us alive in the face of Brandon's larger pack."
 I didn't want her to say anything she wasn't supposed to, especially not if Alec was having as hard of a time controlling the anger that seemed to be part and parcel of the new shapes everyone was wearing, but I was desperate to start understanding some of what was going on.
 Dominic must've looked away from the fight long enough to see the questions on my face.
 "It's hard to understand just how important the pack structure is.
 The question of who is dominant and who is subordinate drives so much of what we do.
 Even so, it's not nearly as bad as other packs, other places.
 Alec's established clear dominance to everyone else here, but he still probably couldn't make his gentler rules stick if it weren't for the fact that Isaac backs him almost without question."

“What about the necromancer traveling with them?
 You’re the one who said he was dangerous, that he might be…”
 Another communal roar, even closer.
 “I know,” Dieredon glared.
 “Forgive me, Antonil.

 Whoever started this war will not go unpunished.”
 The elf whistled, and to the brothers’ surprise a winged horse landed on the rooftop of a nearby home.

4.Study benefits of economic union: Of the estimated 50 per cent fall in GDP among the republics of the former Soviet Union, approximately half can be attributed to the break-up of the economic union.
 Restoration of a common economic space – which is being criticized internationally as a surrender of sovereignty to Russia at a time when both Western Europe and North America are striving for closer economic union – could immediately restore most of that lost output.
 The advantages of cooperation between republics needs to be care fully examined.
 A study should be conducted by a credible institution to estimate the economic losses incurred by the break-up of the common economic space between the former Soviet re publics and to assess the benefits of restoring an economic union in some form.
 It should estimate overall economic growth and living standards for each republic over the next five years operating within and outside the economic union.
 This study can serve as a powerful argument for closer cooperation among the republics.
 The study can be undertaken at very low cost by a consortium of researchers from different research institutes within the Commonwealth of Independent States.
 5.Privatize and develop road transport: Transportation is a major bottleneck to development of a market economy in much of the region.
 Under the centrally planned system, most freight was hauled by trains over main routes to large cities for distribution in bulk by huge government procurement agencies.
 Under a market system, millions of small producers and consumers must be free to buy or sell wherever the price is most attractive.

He moved towards me with a casual grace that made little shivers run through me despite my earlier decision not to let his interest, or lack thereof, affect me.
 "I had a bet with myself that you weren't going to wait.
 Somehow the fact I just lost doesn't matter now."
 It didn't seem possible he was talking to me, that anyone so gorgeous could mean something like that about me.
 I opened my mouth, maybe to laugh the comment off, or otherwise hedge my bets against the humiliation and inevitable mocking laughter.
 Whatever it was I'd intended on saying evaporated away the instant he reached out and slowly slid his finger down the side of my face.
 The tiny part of me that was still screaming none of this could be real was pulled along by the rest of me.
 I completely abandoned myself to the sensations created by his touch.
 My nerve endings didn't know whether to classify his finger as icy cold or scorching hot, but before I could recoil in pain the sensation gave way to a tingly warmth that sank down into my center, simultaneously tightening and relaxing parts I didn't even know I had.
 My pounding heart seemed loud enough to hear from across the street.

 she'd thought it would be something pleasant.
 Was the harshness of his kiss indicative of what sex would be like?
 She couldn't sleep that night.
 After tossing and turning for hours, she got up and took a long bath.
 By the time she'd dressed, it was dawn.
 She was restless, but she didn't know what she wanted to do.
 Finally she decided to go for a walk in the garden to see if the quiet stroll would help her sort out her thoughts and feelings.
 Davis seemed like a different man since they'd become betrothed.

 The goals of peace, prosperity and fulfilment for every human being represent formidable challenges – intellectual, attitudinal, organizational and technological.
 We cannot hope to reach such lofty achievements if we waste and squander the precious and abundant resources – mental, psychological, social and material – placed at our disposal.
 A massive reduction in emphasis on weapons production and military establishments, made possible by recent political events and demanded by the pressing unmet needs of people everywhere, represents both a great opportunity and a considerable challenge.
 The opportunity is not only further to reduce the threat of war by reducing the capacity for waging war, but also to redirect and utilize for other purposes the resources now dedicated to war making and prevention.
 The challenge is to do so at a time when rising unemployment and economic stagnation in many countries make further cuts in the size of the military unpopular domestically.
 Since 1990, the total number of military personnel worldwide has declined by two million or about six per cent.
 By 1998, a further decrease of at least two million is anticipated.
 A large proportion of these demobilized people have already joined, or will soon join, the forces of the unemployed.
 Some may be tempted to market their military skills elsewhere.

There was no emotion in his voice, no gentle teasing; he didn't even meet my eyes.
 I sat down with a slight hope that he'd thaw out a little by the time class ended, only to shake my head in disbelief when the bell finally rang and proved me irrevocably wrong.
 Maybe he'd go back to normal after a few days.
 There really wasn't any way to know though.
 I didn't even know what'd brought on the sudden change.
 Was he really just angry I'd overheard Jasmin threaten Lucy?
 Why did I even care?
 Spanish dragged by at a snail's pace, but somehow before I knew it, I was walking with Britney towards the tutor lab.
 I should have been surprised when we rounded a corner to find Brandon casually leaning against the wall, obviously waiting for us, for me.

 So much for that plan.

 Then I rammed into one.
 “What the heck?” I fell on my butt and blinked as Jason picked himself off the ground.
 “Sorry,” I said and stood up.
 “Watch where you’re going… Jazell, look out!” Jason suddenly yelled.
 I dove onto the ground and felt the monster brush past me.
 I looked up to see Jason rolling on the ground before jumping on the faery jerk’s back.

 "What are you doing?
 You didn't actually hit your head.
 I caught you before you hit the ground."
 I started to shake my head and then thought better of it.
 "Please, every other time I've dropped that quickly I've totally banged myself up.

ICPF refused to side with the pessimists who viewed unemployment as a terminal illness spreading rapidly through the entire world economic system.
 Its report presented evidence to dispel the twin myths that technological development and trade were net job destroyers.
 It traced the growth of employment opportunities through the 20th Century, a century of unprecedented technological development and commercial expansion, to show that this period has also been an era of unprecedented growth in the quantity and quality of employment opportunities.
 The report argued that the current surge in joblessness was a temporary result of the mismatch between the rates of surging population growth and expanding economic activity.
 It concurred that rising levels of unemployment constituted a serious problem that needed to be urgently addressed, but rejected the notion that it is an inevitable and incurable disease which the world must resign itself to passively suffer and endure.
 The Commission, therefore, developed and presented a comprehensive strategy for job-led economic growth.
 Over the past decade, changes in the employment picture lend credence to ICPF’s perspective.
 The American economy experienced a decade-long expansion, fuelling high levels of employment at home, while stimulating job growth throughout East Asia, attracting a massive influx of foreign technical workers and setting the stage for a global outsourcing boom which is still in its infancy.
 Among the advanced economies, unemployment declined from an average of 6.9 per cent in the period 1985-94 to 6.5 per cent during the last 10 years.
 It fell by 10 per cent in France, 25 per cent in Italy, a third in Netherlands, 50 per cent in Spain and 70 per cent in Ireland.

Harruq snarled, the elf inside him all but invisible.
 He charged, recklessly hacking at Aurelia.
 “Why do we fight?” she asked again, desperately trying to block every swing.
 Blood covered her arms, and another swing cut through her dress, slicing into the beautiful flesh of her leg.
 “Why, Harruq?
 Why!”
 “I don’t know!” he cried.
 Strength surged into him, dark and unholy.
 In the blink of an eye, he twirled both swords, knocked Aurelia’s staff from her hand, and then looped his right arm all the way around to bury Condemnation deep into her stomach.
 Everything, all fighting, all arguing, all bleeding, living and dying halted at that moment.

The Helsinki Process, the Stockholm Document, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Warsaw Treaty’s adoption of the doctrine of ‘non-offensive defence’, and most recently the UN Secretary General’s Agenda for Peace – all give highest priority to war prevention.
 While welcome, these incremental measures do not fully recognize either the extent of the danger of the continued application of violence to achieve political ends or the extent of the opportunity which the end of the Cold War has brought for radically altering the way in which humanity settles domestic and international disputes.
 There was a time when war could be justified as a necessary expedient.
 Now the potential human and economic costs of even limited terrorist war – especially if it involves the use of nuclear or biological weapons, but even otherwise – are so great that the risks are no longer tolerable.
 Because the potential risks far outweigh the possible advantages of continued reliance on this means of achieving national and international security, war has become obsolete as an instrument of policy.
 At the same time, there is no longer an insurmountable political conflict within the UN system to prevent all member countries from agreeing to a total ban on the use of violence against each other.
 It is time for the UN to declare war itself a crime against humanity and to ban from membership any nation that engages in aggression against another.
 Even if this intention cannot immediately be made effective, the adoption of this Peace Imperative would mark a milestone in human affairs.
 There is no rational or practical obstacle to the immediate adoption of this measure.
 As a starting point, it can be demonstrated that with the right perspective, courage and commitment, practical immediate solutions are possible for any and all of the conflicts presently raging.

Harruq shrugged, glancing about as he tried to get his bearings.
 A thought hit him, harder than any whacks of Aurelia’s staff.
 “Qurrah!” he gasped.
 “You’ve got to send me back.”
 “I can’t,” Aurelia said, her eyes fixed west.
 “What do you mean you can’t?” He stormed over and grabbed her arms.
 “Send me back, I’m telling you to!
 Qurrah’s all alone, and they’ll kill him if I don’t help him!”
 “I can’t, Harruq, I can’t!” she shouted, pulling back from his hands.
 “I have no strength left to open another portal.

“What will the king do?” asked Harruq, his hands rubbing the hilts of his blades.
 “He has already evicted elven blood from his kingdom.
 Woodhaven, however, still contains hundreds of elves.
 In his pride, Vaelor will demand them to leave.
 A messenger is already en route.
 I have haunted his dreams as well.
 He is but a distant cousin to the king, spoiled and stupid.
 He carries orders to the elves of Woodhaven: leave or die.”
 “They will never leave,” Qurrah said.
 “They are stubborn and will defend their homes until death.”

She imagined him walking through the door, exclaiming that he couldn't stand it any longer, sweeping her into his arms, kissing her.
 Her favorite, though, was having him tiptoe into her room in the morning to play with her hair until her eyelids fluttered open and then bend over her to kiss her.
 He wouldn't be wearing a shirt, and, miraculously, her breath would be fresh and sweet.
 Those dreams were silly, of course.
 Not because they couldn't happen but because they could.
 Marie frowned as she poured soap into the washing machine.
 She wanted very much to kiss Rick.
 But she was betrothed to Davis.
 She shouldn't be kissing other men.
 But it was getting harder to remember that.

 If he lost, it would be much harder.

 He was not sure how Geriodon or Nordien or the other leading contestants were doing.
 At the bell the two started to circle.
 Karun was a large woman.
 She was tall and unusually muscular.
 She moved with an easy cat-like grace and was attractive, in an about to kick your ass sort of way.
 She was probably of the blood and strong.
 She had her brown hair woven into a tight braid and wore well fitting chain and leather armor.

There was no need for words, no argument.
 The decision was made, they only need direction.
 Any hope for success laid in playing to their strength.
 Rodregas said, ”Doi’van, you stay here and use the bow.
 You start from the middle of the caravan as soon as you feel comfortable, and focus on the slavers.
 If you get a free shot at an Immortal Guard, take it, but we need to reduce the numbers against us.” “Imeralda, you need to stay away from the close-in fighting.
 Get as far back as you can and still be able to see and shoot into the road.
 You will focus on the front of the caravan and also focus on the regular slavers.
 Don’t start shooting until Doi’van does, hold steady until they get close and then use your Forest Nymph skills to fade back into the trees well away from the fighting.” Then he said very carefully, so she would understand, “Don’t get yourself killed.
 But if you can stop and turn, take a few more shots.

He even apologized the first time.
 And when I did let him kiss me, he said he'd rather die than ever hurt me."
 Mrs. Tranton reached out to play with a lock of her daughter's hair.
 "Is that why you think he's wonderful?"
 "That's just part of it.
 He spent every evening with me and all weekend.
 He even came home from work earlier than he had been just to be with me.

I’d never been able to move objects, but it seemed I had done it without thinking.
 And it wasn’t just that, but the thistle.
 I needed to see Junnie.
 The door was partially open when I reached Junnie’s house, so I peeked my head in and called for her.
 When she didn’t answer, I slipped in to check the back room.
 As I walked through the sparsely decorated living area, I passed a carved mirror on the wall and noticed something off in my reflection.
 I knew I was flushed, I could feel the frustration and worry, but I stopped to get a closer look.
 There was something not right with my complexion, but what was really off was just above my face.
 I squinted, leaning toward the mirror as my hands reached up of their own accord.
 The first quarter inch of my hair was blackened.

My first instinct was to go find a teacher before the two idiots hurt each other, but while I was still looking around to see if there was an adult in the room, Britney grabbed my arm and pulled me towards the circle.
 It wasn't until we got closer that I realized there was something wrong with the circle of kids surrounding the combatants.
 Normally everyone pressed in tight for the best possible view.
 The spectators in this fight were divided into two groups, with a fairly significant space between them.
 The rest of the students seemed to be reluctant to fill that gap in.
 It wasn't until Britney pulled me closer that I understood why.
 Brandon stood surrounded by his friends on one side of the circle, with Alec and a smaller group standing opposite them.
 The tension in the room was like the air before a lightning strike, charged and unpredictable, a living organism on the point of materializing out of thin air and attacking anything surrounding it.
 Taking in the two groups, I was amazed at the disparity before my eyes.
 The kids behind Brandon were half again as many as the gathering behind Alec, and they were eager for the confrontation, watching with excited eyes, and large smiles.

And, you know, looking at it now, I think I was sick like the country was sick.

 I took those deaths, that ignominious war, the whole queasy zeitgeist of the times and internalized them.
 And I couldn’t get away, not in a cabin, not in my music, not anywhere, man, because the enemy was me.
 And, dad, anyone who’s ever had that kind of stomach failure, where you feel like your whole system is shutting down on you, knows how bone-deep that kind of pain and fear is.
 This is when I started shooting horse.

 You know, I’d always used drugs, to perform, to get up for a performance, to come down afterwards—there were always pills around.
 But I had stayed away from the hard stuff until my GI went bad.

Whoever was on the other end was talking too quietly for me to make out more than the occasional word.
 "...Jack...now...no time..." I could suddenly feel the energy radiating off of Alec as his beast woke and rose to the surface.
 His limbs hadn't taken on the fine tremble of someone only seconds away from changing shape, but he was obviously unhappy.
 Given the tight leash he kept his beast on, I would have been willing to bet that just about anyone else in the pack would have already shifted shapes and ripped a tree out of the ground or done something equally destructive by now.
 Alec shifted the phone slightly, I couldn't hear whoever was on the other end anymore, but whatever they'd just said hadn't made things any better.
 The invisible ants marching up my arms went to double time and the metaphysical breeze that started on his skin and went outward turned into a full-blown gale.
 "Stall them.
 We'll be down in eight minutes if worse comes to worst you two contain Isaac and tell Dom to sit on Jack.
 Keep Rachel out of the way."
 Already moving with the unearthly speed he normally concealed even from me, Alec hung up the phone and started throwing things into the backpack.

 Alec reached back without looking and moved us directly behind him.
 It wasn't until his arm brushed me that I realized he was shaking ever so slightly himself.
 "There's only one way you're going to touch her, James.

 I felt shivers run down me as I realized just how easily everything could boil over into deadly violence.

This is the story of Buddy’s taint, the story of Buddy and his pact with the devil.
 But Buddy had in him a black spot, fed by his desire to make it big, fed by ambition and greed and the sort of misdirected thinking which took Rolling Stone from the hands of the movement and placed it in the hands of the oppressors.
 The commodifying of the sixties, if you will, as embodied by the soul of Buddy Gardner.
 Buddy “Slipshod” Gardner, Memphis’ answer to Jerry Garcia, Memphis gift to the world, from integrity and precocity to sell-out.
 So much is lost now, so little written down, so little recorded.
 For those with the stamina to search it out, Black Lung made one album, released on the Pepper label, a little Memphis soul mixed in with their own acid-blues.
 It was called Turntable Poison.
 Some say it sounded like The Rascals crossed with Hot Tuna.
 One cut comes to mind, a piece they played in every set at The Shell, the ballad, “Mr.
 Handy and Hakel-Bärend.”  On the LP they insisted on the extended version with Buddy’s long, side-handed solos, slick as molten lead and the twelve minute drum solo by Skippy Quetzalcoatl, effectively killing the album’s potential sales but insuring the group a spot in infamy alongside the lost tapes of Mudboy and the Neutrons and the missing five hours of von Stroheim’s Greed.

Marie Tranton, born 1904 .

 It didn't tell the date of her death.
 That was odd--he was sure it had been in this section.
 His heart began racing as he scanned those pages.
 There was no mention at all of her death--or of her marriage.
 The only information was her date of birth, the names of her parents and brother, and the general family history.
 He knew that the other information had been there before, and after his mind had completely rejected the impossible--that the print had changed when Marie had stepped from 1927 into 2011 (another impossibility)--he rapidly considered the implications of such an impossibility.
 Maybe the information about the rest of her life wouldn't appear until she returned.

 “I’m okay now, I think.” His lips twisted again, but I couldn’t make out the expression.
 I could barely look him in the eyes.
 I attempted every type of magic he could come up with, to no avail.
 I was beyond frustrated.
 Worse, I could tell he was being gentle on purpose, afraid I would break.

He climbed the inner stairs until he stepped into the watchtower room at the top.
 He played it bold, walked up to the staring guard and signaled him to turn around.
 Then Rodregas proceeded to gag and bind him.
 The confused guard did not even struggle.
 Next, Rodregas went to the front gate and repeated his actions with the lone guard at the gate; he then picked him up and took him to sit with his friend at the top of the gate.
 He made sure both were securely tied up and blindfolded and took off their weapon harnesses and kept them; their two short swords were nicer than the ones that he had taken from the armory.
 Both men also had purses with them that jingled with their bonus money in a promising way.
 He then headed back to the dungeon, stopping at the chicken coop to let out the chickens.
 They quickly spread all over the yard.
 It would be better for the town folk who lived so close to the fort if the Dire Cats were not starving when they left.

 He reached up and tucked a stray hair behind my left ear.

 The most gorgeous, kind boy I'd ever met had just professed his love to me, and strangely enough it made what I had to do next both harder and easier.
 "Alec, what if I were to go back to Brandon?
 Would that stop everything from going wrong?

Kind of like someone else I know."
 "Unacceptable.
 I've added that up in my head, and you've still got several hours each day that you haven't accounted for."
 Despite my best efforts, I was mumbling so badly I wasn't sure anything I'd said was comprehensible.
 Somewhere in there I'd closed my eyes, so I felt a sluggish, tired kind of surprise when he gently brushed his fingers across the side of my face.
 The sensation was so feathery I almost opened my eyes to verify that he'd really touched me.
 It was too much effort.
 Besides, I didn't really want to know if he hadn't touched me, it was better to just go on pretending he had.
 "I'm afraid that really is the balance of my time.
 I spend time with Rachel of course.

 Or, it’s like Adam and Eve, you know, paradise is full of apples, full of snakes.
 We were in paradise briefly, as we cut that album, made those songs happen, we had it all, chicks, drugs, some money—though they screwed us of course.
 We should have been bigger, gotten better contracts.
 I don’t care about that.
 But, I do care about my songs, man, my damn songs.
 I wrote ‘em and they’re mine and no one can ever take that away, turn the clock back, rewrite history.

She was never that bad.
 I hate her for what she did.
 But, compared to what Gene’s dad did it isn’t worth complaining about.
 Jim – Yep.
 Johnny – How long have you known?
 Jim – About what?
 Johnny – About Gene and his asshole father.
 Jim – Almost as long as I’ve known Gene, it helped me deal with mom better.
 I could always say ‘well at least I don’t have his problems.’
 Johnny – Who else knew?

It was only a momentary touch, but electricity surged though me.
 A flash of confusion or frustration passed over his features, too fast to identify.
 He looked into my eyes one last time as I sat, stunned and speechless, my skin still tingling from the contact.
 “Enough for today,” he said, nodding as he turned, his long strides taking him too quick from my view.
 I sat motionless as I watched him go, and remained so for some time after.
 I hadn’t realized how exhausted I’d been.
 When I finally rose to leave, I stashed a few more of the northern clan documents from the table under my shirt.
 My head was swirling with all that had happened, not simply my new tutor but the magic.
 On my way out I walked past the shelf that hid the body of the now-dead bird.
 I’d never been able to move objects, but it seemed I had done it without thinking.

 .” “Davis makes you happier.” “No.”  She shook her head.
 “He doesn’t.
 He doesn’t spend much time with me or try to comfort me when I’m upset.
 He-he doesn’t—“  She swallowed, her face turning red as she thought, his kisses don’t make me hot like yours do.
 He caressed her cheek.
 “Maybe it’s something you should think about.”  He ran his thumb over her lower lip.
 “You deserve better, Marie.”  He tilted her chin up, touching his lips to hers.
 When she didn't pull away, he repeated the feather-light touch.
 He felt her breath, the quivering of her lips.

"Gifts?"
 "The most powerful of the Fir'shan, the hybrids as the younger generation calls them, occasionally develop unusual abilities.
 Alec's father's was that of being able to heal himself more rapidly than normal, even for our kind.
 Thanatas, the legendary king who defeated the southerners, was said to be able to mold his own body, making powerful changes that made him unbeatable in combat."
 Mallory's explanation was tickling the back of my mind.
 "Is that why Brandon's unbeatable?"
 "Nobody is unbeatable, but yes, that's why Brandon is such a formidable adversary.
 His gift is more prosaic than most, it's just increased strength and speed, but that makes him more than a match for most normal hybrids."
 "That's why Alec had more food than normal dropped off here then?
 Because he really doesn't think he can win?"

Jasmin stopped moving.
 She was still shaking, and when she looked up at me, her eyes still bubbled with hate, but they were human again instead of the pale, ice blue from a moment before.
 With a visible effort of will, Jasmin closed her eyes, calmed her shaking body, and then turned and quickly walked out of the room.
 I was just tall enough to see over Rachel and take in what was going on in the rest of the room.
 James' eyes were still yellow, and he was still inching his way towards me, obviously undeterred by Jasmin's defection.
 The Hispanic girl carefully closed the distance between them, and then placed her slender, perfect dark hand on James' arm once again as she leaned in and whispered something in his ear.
 For a moment it seemed he was going to shake her off again but then he shuddered, shot Alec another dirty look, and stormed out of the room.
 The tiny form following after him looked like a fragile schooner trailing along the edge of a hurricane.
 The room seemed so calm after James disappeared that for a second I forgot Jessica was still half-crouched in the center of the room.
 Alec hadn't forgotten, and if the waves of tension and energy rolling off of him weren't as strong as the combined effects coming from all four of them, it still felt like the walls should explode outwards.

 Of course not.
 "That would be really great.
 Thanks for offering."
 Brandon ran one finger down the side of my face, and then leaned back with a smile as I reached for the door.
 It wasn't until I was out of the car that I realized our Jeep was parked in its normal spot off to the side of the house.
 Excited to talk to Mom about her last outing, I waved goodbye to Brandon and hurried to the door.
 Mom hardly even looked up from her laptop as I walked in.
 Whew, no need to go through the third degree about Brandon.

The dogs stalked toward the four of us looking like a animals about to attack their prey.
 The cute look was gone and all that was left was hunger.
 The dog nearest to me jumped at my chest and landed on my stomach.
 I managed to push it down before it breathed on me.
 My legs froze in place.
 “Emily I need some defrost.” I called to her as the cold seeped through my pants and bit at my skin.
 Emily turned her head and was about to reply when the dog caught her robe.
 She spun around, shooting fire and completely forgetting my cry for help.
 At the same time my dog attacker pushed me to the ground, freeing my legs for me.
 “Get off me mutt.” I growled at his face.

 Just promise to bring it back in the same condition.
 Remember, I'm less concerned with your answer, and more interested in the process you take to try and solve the problem.
 Of course the right answer never hurts."
 I smiled and hurried out of class with a 'thank you'.
 I shouldn't have bothered rushing.
 I slipped into Spanish exactly three seconds before the late bell sounded, but Mrs. Tiggs wasn't even there.
 When she finally did show up, we had a surprise quiz on our vocabulary.
 Once we finished she turned on the television and told us to listen for conjugation.
 I almost wished I shared the class with Britney, her dad seemed like the type to get six kinds of riled up over something like that.

He groaned again.
 It had taken all the strength he had to make himself stop.
 If she kept kissing him, no power on earth, no amount of love or guilt would be able to make him stop.
 "Marie," he began, his voice cracking, "do you want to make love?"
 She froze.
 Make love?
 All she knew was that she wanted more of Rick--more of his kisses and his touches.
 She felt like she couldn't get enough.
 All at once she realized that getting enough meant making love.
 She would have blushed if her entire body weren’t already on fire.

He looked back and she looked confused, squinting as if the room was not fully illuminated by the glowing daemons in their pits.
 “Can you not see into the room?” Rodregas asked.
 “No, I can see something, shapes flicking in fire?
 I think I smell something like rotten eggs, but I can’t see well enough to go in.
 And I don’t know why, but I really don’t want to go in.” Doi’van and Rodregas shared another look and then nodding, stepped out of the chamber.
 The three of them stood silent for a minute.
 Finally, Doi’van spoke, “Maybe you need a connection to see the doors and the room?
 All of us worship the Celestials and we were all drawn to their sigils, especially Rodregas.
 I was drawn to the door here, which makes sense.
 This room, like the Celestial Chamber, seems to have similar beasts of the Infernal realm.

If you get in my way, if you approach him on her behalf, if you even think of acting on any of the hundred things going through your mind right now, I'll kill you too."
 My knees were weak, but I had to get out now.
 For all that I hated Cassie, there was no way this crazy chick would act on her threats when there were three of us to corroborate each other's stories.
 I quietly swung the stall door open and felt my eyes go wide as I saw Lucy curled up, sobbing, at Jasmin's feet.
 Neither of the other girls even bothered to look at me as I carefully moved to the door.
 Jasmin took half a step to the side, giving me room to get around her, but there wasn't even a slight drop in the level of menace she was radiating.
 It was like I didn't even exist.
 I was still shaking on my way down the hall.
 By the time I made it into Algebra, I thought I was going to throw up.
 I felt like a complete coward, but I wasn't willing to go back there.

The half-orc shrugged.
 “Better than most.
 So yeah.”
 The elf looked him up and down, sending chills roaring along his spine.
 It seemed so strange that she had saved his life, since at that moment he felt like all she wanted was to see him dead.
 “Come tomorrow with swords to spar,” she said at last, tucking a few strands of hair behind her ear.
 “You can train me to wield my staff in melee combat.”
 “I don’t see a staff,” Harruq said.
 “I don’t see any swords either,” she shot back.
 “Fine.

Today, Bob Dylan remains a force in my life, though now, he’s also a pal.
 And I can go to him—to his songs--when I am blue, when I am feeling that the world is a place of malefaction and discommoded energy, when I am feeling that there is nothing to be said for the human race, and I can be readjusted.
 How this happens, why this happens, is secondary to the fact that it does.
 I can listen to “Frankie Lee and Judas Priest” or “Visions of Johanna” or “On the Road Again” or “Clothesline Saga” or “Watching the River Flow” and feel that there are angels within humankind.
 I can feel that we are not all lost in the caliginous wastes of our hopelessly chaotic lives.
 Art redeems us.
 This is the seed I’m seeking, the truth I’m trying in my clumsy way to impart.
 Dylan is art, for us anyway, for what we’re talking about.
 Now, knowing Bob, I have to say, he’s a humble prophet, you know?
 But I still wish I had a clearer picture of how it all happened, to me, Dylanwise.

They then dragged the body outside to where the deceased elf had kept a private garden.
 Thick brick walls guarded against any prying eyes.
 They dug a large hole in a corner and then bled the body dry, letting the fluids soak into the dirt.
 Occasionally, they would halt and listen, worried their violent struggle had reached unwanted ears.
 No curious investigators arrived, however, and they continued with their dark deed.
 When the blood dripping from the elf’s wounds became but a trickle, they filled the hole and moved on.
 Using the clothes and robes from upstairs, the two brothers wiped away as much of Ahrqur’s blood as they could.
 They tossed the bloody clothes, the table, and the pieces of glass they into the fireplace and burned them.
 Harruq wrapped the body in spare blankets he found in a closet.
 “Grab the sword,” he said as he hoisted the dead elf onto his shoulder.

It seemed impossible that she'd be so insensitive to my situation.
 I opened my mouth to tell her off, and then realized she wasn't privy to everything happening in my head.
 My world felt like it was disintegrating around me, and hers continued on as normal.
 It should have been depressing, but somehow I found it so ludicrous I giggled.
 The laugh had a definite edge of hysteria to it, but it still felt good.
 "Rachel, my life doesn't work like that.
 Even if I could afford a trip like that, my mom would never let me go.
 She's only an absentee parent when I need her."
 Rachel's soft blue eyes got really wide as she recoiled slightly.
 Whatever she was about to say was preempted as we were both thrown forward in our seats.

I looked her square in her beautiful blue eyes and I told her flatly, “You are going to fall so in love with me that you will not even remember this guy’s name!” We were married three years later.
 After all the years we have been married, I still think of that moment I saw her walk into that bar whenever we are having a tough time.
 It puts all my love right back where it belongs and nothing else matters.
 Chapter 11: The Prescription Startled, I scan across the windshield and fumble for the ringing phone.

 She tells me how they are having some difficulty raising the cash and are trying to work it out.
 Ashley takes my temperature on fronting her some of the drugs if they can’t get all the cash, and I can hear Steve coaching her in the background.
 I tell her this is unacceptable.
 She says she’ll get all the money and see me shortly.

They were being careful with me, didn’t want to upset me.
 I tried to ease them.
 “So we go back to the village and…” They shared an uncomfortable glance, and then, “Not High Council, Freya.

 The council had sent trackers—the pair Chevelle had choked and released, and the other, the broken, limp corpse in the clearing by the ridge.
 We had killed him.

She laid her head on his shoulder, pleased but confused.
 Rick was so different from Davis.
 She wished that she could talk about him with her mother.
 But when she could again talk with her mother, there'd be no point.
 Rick would be gone.
 That thought brought tears to her eyes, and she snuggled closer to him, wishing she could have everyone she cared about in the same decade.
 They spent the afternoon watching TV, reading, and napping.

And, you know, looking at it now, I think I was sick like the country was sick.
 I was nauseated for the USA, you dig?
 I took those deaths, that ignominious war, the whole queasy zeitgeist of the times and internalized them.
 And I couldn’t get away, not in a cabin, not in my music, not anywhere, man, because the enemy was me.
 And, dad, anyone who’s ever had that kind of stomach failure, where you feel like your whole system is shutting down on you, knows how bone-deep that kind of pain and fear is.
 This is when I started shooting horse.
 I’m not proud of it.
 You know, I’d always used drugs, to perform, to get up for a performance, to come down afterwards—there were always pills around.
 But I had stayed away from the hard stuff until my GI went bad.
 I couldn’t take it—I admit it, I couldn’t take it, man.

I find myself less interested in their chat as I mentally prepare myself for the task at hand.
 I am given the weapons and shots fired instructions again.
 In my usual humorous deflection of discomfort, I quip that the last time I met Ashley it was a “happy ending” and I would like the same result this time.
 The officers are un-amused.
 The officers are sent to stake out a nearby drugstore.
 My story to the drug dealers will be that I will fill the prescription there and meet her in that parking lot as it is a stone’s throw within the county line which they want the bust in.
 One problem I point out is that the drugstore will be closed in a few minutes but they send the crew that direction for feedback on the location.
 The call comes back and the parking lot is virtually empty of cars leaving no cover for the officers to hide.
 I am starting to feel like I know more about this drug busting business than the cops.
 After a change of venue to a nearby grocery store down the street and several miles within the county line, it is nearly 9 pm and I have been unable to call my wife for over three hours.

For that matter, where had he been hiding them?
 It wasn't even remotely possible that all of the people who were going to be at the party were old enough to drink without getting arrested.
 Brandon looked at my white knuckles and laughed.
 "Don't worry, nobody's going to make you drink, and we've never been busted by the cops.
 We'll have you safely back home sometime early tomorrow morning, and your mom will never have the slightest idea you went to such a wild gathering."
 As far as reassurance went, it was a pretty lame attempt, but somehow it didn't sound so feeble when it was Brandon saying it.
 I calmed down enough to marvel at the amount of other baggage Vincent dragged out of the house, and then any chance I might have had to back out vanished as Brandon picked me up and deposited me on the tailgate of Vincent's truck.
 "Riding in the back, isn't that illegal?"
 The high-maintenance blonde Vincent was helping up next to me rolled her eyes.
 "Please."

 Sliding his arms around her waist, he added, "It's been special for me too."
 She knew he was going to kiss her; she'd known it the second she'd felt his arms go around her waist.
 When his lips touched hers, she clutched at his shirt, but then her hands slid around his waist and up his back.
 His kiss was sweet, warm, loving, and when his lips left hers, she was disappointed.

Rodregas breathed in deeply, trying to settle himself, and almost gagged from the smells: the stench of fresh blood, the scent of fear from the prisoners, the smell of power, and other smells that he could not identify.
 Rodregas closed down on himself, “Duty,” he thought.
 “My real duty this time, focus on the next step.
 I can do this.” As Rodregas raised the club, he kept his eyes away from the AElf maiden not wanting to give himself away to anyone watching.
 “Gods,” Rodregas quietly prayed.
 “You have never answered my prayers.
 I have never had much to give you as an offering of wealth to your temples, nor have I done great deeds in your names, but if any of you hate these life-stealing Immortalists as I do, then let me know your favor.” Rodregas could not help but add a selfish plea to his desperate prayer, “If by your grace I live, then I promise you gods that I will make it my life’s duty to fight the Life Stealers.” Rodregas doubted his prayers would do any good, but if nothing else he was a practical man and when you are pushing the odds it never hurts to call in divine favor.
 Rodregas knew things would start moving quickly now.
 Ravenhurr had been preparing the circles for months, feeding them with unearthly energies.

The process results in improvements in health, which raise the level of physical energy; higher standards of education, which raise the level of mental energy and culture; and higher levels of social skills and organization, which raise the energy level of the entire society, making it ever more creative and productive.
 A comprehensive study of this wider process of job creation and destruction arising from technological innovation is needed to develop specific coefficients for measuring the impact of technological advances in different fields on total employment.
 Eventually, we may hope to dispel the widespread fear and sense of helplessness that this issue evokes.
 The notion that there are a fixed or inherently limited number of jobs that can be created by the economy is a fiction.
 It is not just advances in technology that work in this fashion.
 Every major advance in social attitudes, institutions, values and lifestyles has a dual effect on employment, creating jobs in some areas and destroying them in others.
 Higher standards of education not only raise productivity, but also stimulate higher expectations that lead to greater consumption.
 Changing attitudes toward the environment have created entirely new industries and generated new jobs in every field where impact on the environment is of concern.
 New types of organization such as fast-food restaurants, franchising and hire purchase or leasing create new jobs by hastening the growth or expanding the activities of the society.
 Shifting attitudes toward marriage and the role of women create greater demand for jobs but also more opportunities for employment, because working women consume more and require additional services.

Rodregas realized that his attackers were clearly not trained fighters.
 He felt himself relax as he realized that they posed no real danger to him now that he was on his feet and aware.
 Just as Rodregas relaxed from the heart pounding life or death moment that had awoken him, the man holding the rake stepped forward.
 Rodregas realized that he was even taller and bigger than the first one.
 The attacker swung the rake right at him with all his weight behind it.
 Rodregas was too close to dodge, and the rake hit his wounded gut straight on with the full brunt of his attacker’s weight.
 Rodregas swooned in pain as his fresh wound took the blunt of the blow.
 He had started to feel like he was faster and stronger than everyone else, and had not been expected the power of the blow.
 Rodregas went flying back down to the ground moaning.
 He rolled with it and came back up.

Maybe we can try to get somewhere without bad guys jumping out at us.” “We should move, before something does find us.

 “Let's move boys, we have a lot more walking to do.” Jason groaned.
 “Why can't they have cars in Igneeria?

 “Good thinking,” she said.
 “The girls should take control.” I shrugged.
 “I guess if that's what you want to do.” Thankfully, there were no trees anywhere except one.
 The ground was mostly dirt and rock, easier to walk on.
 The mountains loomed ahead of us and something tingled down my spine.

Advocates of private enterprise contrast the failures of Eastern European agriculture with the achievements of the industrial nations as ample evidence of the free market’s superior capacity to achieve high levels of agricultural productivity.
 Recently, international and bilateral financial institutions have promoted the market as the most effective instrument for managing agriculture throughout the world.
 This view leaves two questions unanswered.
 First, if the market is so effective, why is it that every major capitalist economy utilizes such a vast array of subsidies, incentives, controls, production quotas and fixed pricing mechanisms to govern production and trade in agricultural products?
 Even after GATT, protection for this sector by industrial nations will remain high.
 Second, granted that the market works effectively for mature capitalist societies with high levels of technology, education, productivity, living standards and food surpluses, and relatively small portions of the workforce dependent on agriculture, is the same necessarily true for countries at an earlier stage of development, in which (1) a majority of the workforce is dependent on agriculture for sustenance, (2) levels of education, productivity and incomes are low, and (3) any increase in food prices can have a devastating impact on food consumption levels in the country?
 The answers to these questions are relevant both to the countries presently making the transition from centrally planned to market economies in Eastern Europe and to poorer developing countries striving to achieve food security.
 Nations accord special status to their agricultural sector for several reasons.
 Continuous supplies of food are absolutely essential to the welfare of the population.
 Food prices are extremely sensitive to changes in the supply of foodstuffs.

 Brandon's normal smile was back.

“You spelled my name wrong,” Harruq said.

 The half-orc reached over, erased the k in his name and drew a clumsy, capitalized Q at the end.

 “Why did you change it?” she asked.
 “It’s a rather odd spelling.”
 “Look at my brother’s name,” he said.

 They think the animals understand.
 They follow the wolves, you see.
 That is why they are here.” We topped the ridge, jagged rock and loose dirt shifting beneath our feet, and Ruby dropped the quiver by the edge before climbing down with a deftness I had yet to master.

He introduced the man on the right, who stepped to the mike and silenced the crowd with a hymn.
 Billy Graham followed, and began to speak with such gentle authority, he stopped my eyes from wandering to the neck of the babe with auburn curls.
 Billy Graham quoted from a Bible prophet, in a manner that made me feel prophesied to.
 He commanded, Learn to do well, relieve the oppressed and the fatherless, plead for the widow.
 Come now, he said, and let us reason together.
 Though our sins are as scarlet, they can be as white as snow.
 If only we’re willing and obedient, we can reap the good of the land.
 And he warned us.
 The hydrogen bomb had cast its shadowy threat of annihilation over the whole earth.
 Sooner than we imagined, the basic power of the universe would be given into the hands of mad men.

Most of his bruises had already faded, hidden beneath the gray hue of his skin.
 He drew many glances, however, and he did his best to ignore them.
 The people of Woodhaven accepted him but still viewed his blood in bad regard.
 Elves and humans held little love for the orcish kind and had ever since their creation.
 That distaste suited Harruq just fine.
 Deep down, Harruq felt he deserved their ire.
 He stopped by Maggie’s Place, not bothering to go inside.
 It was early morning and anyone already drinking would hardly be useful.
 Instead, he stopped the first random passerby that appeared to be a kindly person.
 “Do you know of a woman named Aurelia?” he asked, butchering the pronunciation.

“Can you do anything with this?” “No.” Frustration was clear in my voice.
 I had already tried.
 “And no fire?” “No.” “So nothing works?” The implication was there, but I didn’t know what it meant right away.
 And then it occurred to me.
 The horse.
 I had thought he had shown up because I’d impressed upon him to follow before I blacked out, but I had already been bound again at that point.
 Should I tell Chevelle?
 I didn’t know why I felt so protective of this secret.
 Chevelle drew a section of moss from one of the stones on the wall and it replaced the pebble.
 “Try this.

I tried to keep the disappointment from my face, but his expression fell a little despite my best efforts.
 "You're unhappy with me?"
 "No.
 I mean not really unhappy, at least not with you.
 Maybe with the situation.
 I just feel left out of everything that's going on.
 I know you don't want to get me any more deeply involved with 'dangerous information', but it really sucks sometimes."
 Alec gazed at me for several seconds, and then sighed.
 "If you would like to come watch, you may.
 Give us half an hour, and then ask Donovan to show you the way."

This prompted us to examine the potential benefits that could be derived from transferring or redirecting scientific, technological, educational and productive resources from military applications to support development and the environment.
 At the same time, increasing pressure was mounted by donors on aid-dependent developing countries to reduce their own defence spending, often with out consideration for the genuine security concerns of these countries.
 The need to improve mechanisms to protect all nations from external aggression has stimulated a rethinking of the competitive security paradigm which has governed relations between nations throughout the century, and the formulation of an alternative approach.
 The slow expansion of world trade and economic growth in developing countries during this period, attributable to prolonged recession in industrialized nations and a drastic decline in demand from Eastern Europe, underlined the need for more effective and better-coordinated development strategies to address the problems of the world's one billion people who live in hunger and absolute poverty.
 Increasing the production and availability of food to meet the nutritional needs of a still rapidly expanding global population led us to propose steps to double food production in deficit regions.
 In many countries, the problem of hunger has less to do with insufficient food production than with distribution or entitlement.
 The poor lack remunerative employment opportunities to generate the purchasing power needed to obtain the minimum essential requirements of food.
 In 1990, the Commission undertook a study of alternative strategies to eradicate poverty among the 300 million extremely poor in India, representing about 25 per cent of the poor worldwide, by more extensive development of commercial agriculture and agro-based industries.
 Following ICPF's third plenary meeting in Madras in October 1991, ICPF's Prosperity 2000 plan for creating 100 million jobs in India was presented to the Indian government, which incorporated the strategy in its Eighth Five Year Plan.
 The findings of that study and the strategic recommendations that emerged from it convinced us that eradicating the spectres of hunger, unemployment and poverty was possible even though these problems are present on such a massive scale in many developing countries.

Still, because Eric didn’t create himself, to worship him would be like praising Hamlet rather than Shakespeare.
 Besides, if Eric died for me, it probably wasn’t the human in him, but the Christ.
 So I will take care not to worship Eric, only adore him.
 I wonder if I have been stricken by acute anthropomorphism.
 Maybe I should give up watching my Joan of Arcadia CD collection.

It was dark; even with the dust I’d not slept through the night.
 I sat up, curling my legs against my chest, and wrapped my arms around them, pulling tightly in.
 Though I didn’t speak, I occasionally glanced, or glared, at Ruby.
 She sat, immobile, watching me.
 It was morning before she broke.
 “You have your fire back.” It hadn’t occurred to me.
 I held my hand out and flicked a flame above my palm, then promptly extinguished it.
 I tried moving a stone from the ground to no avail.
 Just fire.
 I sighed.

His breathing continued, slow and steady.
 He fought down a laugh, despite all his training.
 As dire as his situation seemed, he could honestly say he had been in worse shape before and survived.
 Three times, even.
 Then his ears heard what he had feared: something walking directly behind him.
 The others might not see him, but seeing wouldn’t be necessary if one stumbled directly atop his prone body.
 His good hand fingered the bow pinned beneath him.
 If discovered, he would die fighting.
 The footsteps neared.
 A clacking sound haunted his hearing.

Values are a powerful instrument to spur development.
 They are goals or standards that set the direction and mobilize the collective cultural energies of the society for great accomplishment.
 They prompt us to strive for the maximum that is conceivable, rather than the mini mum that is achievable.
 Values form the basis for the tremendous developmental achievements of the past two hundred years, such as the Japanese commitment to teamwork and consensus, the American devotion to enterprise and innovation, the German dedication to quality, and the Dutch commitment to partnership with other people, rather than exploitation.
 Development is retarded by the slow pace at which new values are acquired, which normally requires a change of generation.
 But values can also be consciously transmitted through education in order to abridge the time needed for transition.
 The efforts over the last ten years to implement the value of environmental security illustrate the range of knowledge, information, attitudes, institutions, systems, and skills needed to achieve any high value in life.
 The recommendations presented in this report are intended to form a basis for identifying and providing the values, attitudes, organizations and skills needed to achieve peace and prosperity at the dawn of the third millennium.
 It is well known that societies which are able to harness their cultural energies for development tend to progress very rapidly.
 Yet at the same time, we know that cultural factors can also be a barrier to rapid progress.

There was no mistaking our destination when we spotted it.
 It looked like the recreation yard in the film One Flew Over the Coo Coo’s Nest, as people milled about, stopping and turning to look at us as we entered the parking lot.
 The facility itself might have been a roadside migrant worker motel.
 People were roaming around the grounds doing everything from raking leaves to just hanging in groups, but each one stopped what they were doing to examine us as we drove in.
 We could immediately tell that visitors to this desolate location were rare.
 Brandon approached the vehicle with enthusiasm and the brightest broadest smile we have ever seen on his face.
 We instantly noticed his weight gain and he proudly announced through our open car window that he was nearing 170 pounds, and he looked healthy for the first time in so many years.
 His complexion was clear and his eyes were the bright blue they once were and the whites of his eyes were shinny and clear.
 Brandon could hardly wait for us to open the car door and he embraced each of us as if he hadn’t seen us in years.
 I know I hadn’t seen him like this in years.

Even if they arrived right now, someone was probably going to get hurt.
 Cassie tossed her hair and smiled, a plastic expression that bordered on a smirk.
 "Shut your lying mouth.
 I'm really going to enjoy this."
 Britney had positioned herself so she could see Brandon.
 As a consequence, I could see Alec's entire group, and I was amazed by their reaction to Cassie's belligerence.
 Jasmin's pretty lips drew back in something that looked almost like a snarl, and she'd tensed up so tightly she was almost shaking.
 For a heartbeat I thought Jasmin would launch herself at the other girl, but Alec reached over without looking, and grabbed her arm.
 A stocky, Middle Eastern-looking boy to Alec's right looked like he wanted to act as well, but he was looking at Alec, and an almost imperceptible headshake stopped him.
 I'd been so busy watching the byplay behind Rachel that I'd missed the last two exchanges between her and Cassie.

He collapsed to one knee, his hands latched around his sword.
 He tried to raise the blade, but all the strength had left his hands.
 He had lost too much blood.
 When Harruq came charging forward, Condemnation red and hungry, all he could do was dodge.
 Condemnation shattered what remained of the table.
 The elf rolled, his arms tucked against his chest.
 When he pulled out of the roll, he dashed for a large dresser.
 Inside was a stash of healing potions.
 All he needed was one and he could fight again.
 Just one.

This is why Immortalists used circles to manage the power.
 Raven Keep was on such a line but you could not feel it due to the powerful circles built into the tower.
 It was probably why Raven Town was not closer.
 “Come on,” Rodregas said.
 “Let’s get to shelter before dark.” As he headed into the hidden hollow the orchard became clear.
 He was sure that at one point it had straight rows and a pattern to it.
 But the orchard had been wild for a very long time.
 While there was a bunch of fruit trees and berry bushes, most were the descendants of the original orchard and it was hard to find anything that reassembled a straight row.
 The apples trees were in fruit and they all started grabbing a few of each to eat as they went.
 Rodregas was not much of a farmer and did not know what the different types were named, but he liked the small green ones with the yellow splotches; they were sweet with a wonderful tang.

It was hard to believe Vincent could be so nonchalant after having almost killed someone.
 It'd been an accident obviously, but still that wasn't the kind of thing you just shook off.
 All of the kids that'd been rushing forward to congratulate Isaac for his heroic save started backing away.
 Anxious to avoid the fight, I tried to move with the crowd, but felt a flash of pain as my abused ankle protested.
 For a second I couldn't think about anything other than the agony.
 When I managed to get my eyes to focus again, Vincent was only a couple of inches away from Isaac and hissing something too quiet for me to make out.
 Whatever it was, Vincent was all but foaming at the mouth while Isaac was so controlled it was hard to believe a fight was about to break out.
 As admirable as Isaac's calm was, I was actually wishing he was a little more worked up.
 I'd seen plenty of fights where the guy who got the first hit in won.
 Vincent was going to throw the first punch, and then Isaac was going to go down like a house of cards.

But, Gracella was an impressive Immortalist and a rising star in the Guild.
 She had been Oreintvenir own Adapt when she was young, and as a favored member of the Guild, her friendship could prove important some day.
 “He simply wanted me to keep an eye out when I travel to the Cathedral of the Heavens,” he responded.
 The two of them were slowly walking back to his suite through the gleaming marble corridors with their wide windows and breath taking views of the city below; they both shared polite nods to other Immortalist, mostly young Adapts who resided in the city.
 She did not respond to his answer at first, finally she asked “Does he want you to keep an eye out for Oreintvenir?” Van’dret shook his head and said.
 “He mentioned Ravenhurr as a concern.” “But, he simply went mad.
 That is not uncommon,” she said with a voice laced with surprise.
 “Actually,” said Van’dret, “it is very rare for a Master of Ravenhurr’s level to go mad.
 I am not sure if you ever met him, but he was good, very good.” “Then in that case we had better all keep our eyes open.” She said.

I only tell stories.
 Buddy got his first musicmaker, a ukulele, when he was a sapling, six years old, a first-grader at Idlewild Elementary.
 He hung onto that uke as if it was his lifeline, time and time again having it taken from him on the playground where he would serenade a few curious classmates with his bewailing renditions of old Hank Williams songs.
 The end of most schooldays found little Buddy in the principal’s office explaining why he should get his instrument back and vowing never to bring it again.
 Until tomorrow.
 At twelve Buddy had graduated to electric guitar, a gift from his father, Al Gardner, who had played clarinet with a dance band called Dick Delisi and the Syncopators, at the Vapors Supper Club in his own mis-spent youth.
 Buddy’s mother, Elise, could only pull at her hair and clap dishpan hands over her ears when the noise emanating from Buddy’s room began.
 To her it sounded like the can-opener on warp speed.
 Buddy drew from everywhere, listening with equal fervor to Woody Guthrie, Odetta, Hoagy Carmichael, Django Reinhardt, Coleman Hawkins, Bill Haley, Lonnie Donegan, Howlin Wolf, Eric Dolphy, Skip James, Shostakovich.
 Music fed Buddy the way most of us grew up on oatmeal and peanut butter.

The most gorgeous, kind boy I'd ever met had just professed his love to me, and strangely enough it made what I had to do next both harder and easier.
 "Alec, what if I were to go back to Brandon?
 Would that stop everything from going wrong?
 I mean, then you wouldn't have been poaching his property or whatever you call it."
 It was bad enough that my heart was shattering as I said it, the look in Alec's face made everything a hundred times worse.
 For a second I thought the earth was shaking, but it was Alec, trembling much like he'd done Friday night.
 A loud crack from beside us made me jump.
 Alec looked at the branch, easily as thick as my arm, which he'd just torn from the tree we were leaning against.
 He stopped shaking as he considered what he'd done to the poor tree.
 "You're saying that because you're worried for me?

So, I thought, what could best set my spirit on the right path?
 I believe it was God who sent the message: "Look here, you're a writer.
 But for months you haven't been writing, which has grieved your spirit into a coma.
 Sure, teaching nine classes and raising kids is hard, but it’s not going to kill you.
 What will kill you is not writing.” The next morning, I got up at 5 a.m. instead of 5:30, which allowed me to write for a half hour.
 Not much, but enough to give me hope, which is the antidote to despair.
 The stuff I wrote during those half-hour sessions became crucial parts of my novel The Loud Adios.
 About a month after the semester ended, I sent the manuscript to a national contest.
 I won.
 But success isn't the point.

 Jim – That would be funny, if it wasn’t so blatantly suicidal.

I have Eric's treasures, which Sylvia gave me.
 Along with them came a treasure of hers, a letter from Pam Greenman.
 She wrote, "One can't begin to talk about Eric because there is no beginning, just as there is no end.
 To say what he was would be impossible since he was so different to so many people.
 To me he was something intangible.
 You could hear him, feel him, see him, but you could never grasp hold of what there was inside of him that made him Eric.
 Free, intricate, searching are all words that lived in him.
 "I first met him last summer.
 It seems like such a short time but he became so much a part of me there's no telling how many centuries of growing up we both did.
 "I took him everyplace.

 Liz – Yes you do need to pay attention, that’s how you got into trouble with…
 Jim – …I only did that once, and I have been watching for those conditions ever since.
 Liz – Too bad you weren’t paying attention the first time it happened.
 But let’s keep moving.
 Jim – Well, I love the two, of first, Jesus shaking hands with Elvis, and then of them fighting a gaggle of ninjas.
 It isn’t about your parents is it?
 I just thought it was about Jesus and Elvis fighting ninjas.
 That would make a sweet comic book, the King of Rock and Roll and the King of Kings, battling ninjas and the forces of evil to save the world.

At first I almost blacked out, it was so intense, but you learn to control it, right?
 I mean, I learned to let myself soar, to let myself fall into it, to not be afraid.

 It’s that first jump that’s scary.
 After that, it’s all magic—after that I knew who I was.

The affirmation of democratic principles cannot and will not stop with the domestic governance of member countries.
 It is inevitable that the same principles be extended to the relationships between the nations that make up the international community.
 The present structure of the UN system is a product of the Second World War, just as the League of Nations was of the First.
 The Allied powers conceived it at the height of the war and evolved its structure to reflect the immediate post-war realities.
 Russia, the USA, France and the UK emerged from the war as the arbiters of the world order.
 The defeated Axis powers, Germany and Japan, were relegated to the back ground.
 Mainland China had become communist and was therefore excluded from the power structure.
 India and the other colonies had not yet gained their freedom.
 In recognition of the mutual suspicions between Russia and the Western powers, the rule of unanimity usually adopted by political conferences was applied to decisions made by the five major powers that became the permanent members of the Security Council.
 The rest of the world was poorly represented.

Rachel grabbed my arm as I tensed up.
 "I don't know what you're going to do, but maybe you shouldn't get up yet."
 I looked over at Rachel's concerned face and opened my mouth to thank her for whispering, for keeping my secret, only the words didn't come out.
 Instead the image of Alec, the one that had burned itself onto my retinas a few seconds previously just as it had done in physics when I'd looked over to see his broken pencil, flared back into life before my eyes.
 "You knew there was another time.
 Alec told you about Physics."
 Rachel opened her mouth, probably to deny it, but the look in her eyes told me it was true.
 She couldn't possibly be that scared about me putting two and two together if he'd been saying nice things about me.
 He hated me, and she was scared of him, scared of what he'd do if he found out she'd let his secret slip.
 "It's not like that, Adri.

It felt odd, uncomfortable, not like the hawk.
 The feeling reminded me of something and I drew back, opening my eyes to focus on remembering.
 The small gray bird on the lip of the library window.
 For a fraction of a second I had been there, in that bird before I dropped it.
 I hadn’t realized.
 The moment had seemed insignificant in the course of things.
 I laughed at myself as it dawned on me that I probably could have simply made it stop singing.
 And the frog that had exploded on my white gown—I had been there for a mere instant.
 Their minds were so small, so simple, it was like nothing.

 I couldn't place him.
 I slowly shook my head, trying to jar something loose enough to figure out who he was.
 "Please, Adriana.
 It really isn't any trouble.
 James, can you get your car, please?"
 He looked angry.
 Like maybe he was going to argue, but as he opened his mouth Rachel turned and glared at him.
 It seemed odd to see someone only a little smaller than Alec back away from someone even smaller than me.
 The image stuck with me so strongly that I considered it until Rachel came over and took my hand.

She was also highly skilled, and while not as physically gifted as Rodregas, she was powerful.
 She was also clearly intelligent.
 She must have been watching Rodregas in earlier matches, as she refused to let him close with her shield to shield and let him out muscle her.
 She moved quickly and fluidly, keeping her feet moving and keeping her distance.
 Her sword wove in and out, back and forth.
 Rodregas blocked one blow only to find two others coming at him.
 He quickly found himself on the defensive and suffered both a cut on his upper hand and cheek.
 He started to worry that the knight would end the match and give Karun the victory.
 He tried to use his speed to advantage and trap her sword.
 But he nearly lost his sword instead.

I grabbed a close volume and leafed through it.
 It was a legacy of the Viridian Forest clan.
 I pulled another volume down.
 A diary of Momar the Ancient.
 I sighed.
 This was going to be like trapping a greased pixie.
 I sat for hours exploring the early texts, stories of the river clans and their battles with the Imps of Long Forgotten, firsthand accounts of the Trials of Istanna, and the long lineages of the eldest families.
 A whisper roused me from my studies and I realized it was late, so I decided to give up and start again the next day.
 Rising unsteadily, I heard the whisper again.
 But it wasn’t a whisper—it was the wind.

Mrs. Sorenson was just as nasty as she'd been every day this week, but I didn't care when she managed to stump me on her second question.
 I found myself subconsciously comparing Heathcliff with Brandon during English, and Mr. Whethers had to ask me a question at least twice before I realized he was talking to me.
 I hardly even blushed at the inevitable giggles.
 I made a mental note to find out from Britney if I'd caught his question on the second or third repetition, but I rather suspected I'd forget.
 In fact, when class finally got out I remembered my question, but just didn't feel like asking.
 Instead, I just wanted to get away from her and the never-ending gossip.
 I waited until she stopped to talk to one of the cheerleaders about who was dating who, and then mumbled something about the bathroom, and made a break for it.
 Not wanting to out-and-out lie, I ducked into the nearest restroom.
 It was empty except for a mousy brunette I'd only seen a couple of times before.
 I smiled and started to open my mouth to say hi, but thought better of it.

I didn’t know I was going down until my knees hit the hard rock.
 I held myself there, refusing to give in.
 They argued frantically.
 “Knock her out.
 Do something.
 She’s going to crack.” Yes, crack.
 That was a good word for it.
 I felt as if I were breaking in half.
 No, being torn.
 I sensed someone close to me, Ruby no doubt.

Brandon was tugging on my arm now, not hard enough for anyone to think he'd been driven off by a mere school administrator, but urgently enough I allowed myself to be guided away.
 We hadn't gone more than a step or two before his grip on my arm grew painful.
 I hissed in discomfort and he released me, but not before I noticed that his other hand was white-knuckled and his jaw was clenched.
 "Sorry, I just don't like to see that kind of needless destruction.
 It makes everyone look bad and costs the town a lot of money."
 Brandon's smile was back, but it didn't have his trademark easy carelessness.
 "Now you sound like my mom."
 We rounded a corner before Brandon could say anything else and nearly ran into Britney.
 "Guys!
 Did you see the back door?"

“ _Hemorrhage,_ ” the half-orc hissed.
 The elf’s face exploded.
 Qurrah fell over onto his side, breathing as slowly as he could through the blood that filled his throat.
 The dead body of the elf crumpled in front of him, all of his hate-filled features gone from his face except for a single eye.
 The half-orc stared, wondering if his brother was truly dead.
 Darkness crept at the corner of his sight.
 His strength was fading fast, and he had little doubt that if he passed out he would never wake.
 He struggled to lift a single numb hand, then flopped it down on top of the dead elf’s leg.
 Qurrah took as deep a breath as he dared and then spoke the words of a spell.
 Each syllable was slow torture, garbled in blood and born of pain most horrid.

 If you do, I'll tell them the rest.” “Seth!” Jason said and ran over.
 “You're awake, man!” “Yes and I feel like crap,” he said.
 “I think that if I try to stand up I'll either pass out or throw up.” “Will you be okay flying?” Emily asked.
 “What?” I asked.
 “Flying?
 What do you mean 'flying', Emily?” “Our new dragon friend offered to fly us out of the woods region and towards more of the mountains.
 I said yes, of course, because I don't want to walk the whole way there,” she explained and walked towards the dragon.
 “I guess...” Seth said and stood up.
 He paled and started to sway.

Maybe she should just prepare something simple and have candlelight and flowers from the garden.
 No--that seemed silly.
 How could she plan a romantic evening when she'd just told him that she couldn't marry him?
 She closed the book with a sigh.
 She loved Rick with a passion she'd never imagined.
 She wanted to marry him.
 But she wanted to go home too.
 She missed her family.
 And she wanted to see Davis again--so she could tell him off.
 She wanted to tell him that now she knew how she should be treated by a man who really loved her.

As Rodregas headed out to the sands of the Cathedral arena for the jousting match, he was relieved to see Imeralda waiting at the entrance to talk to him.
 She had been out all night on her mission.
 “Well, I have to say I am very tired of talking so I will make this quick,” she said with her normal sunny smile.
 Rodregas had to admit she did look tired.
 “First, Geriodon is much disliked.
 He is gruff, unfriendly and too serious to like.
 The squires and knights universally dislike him.
 This is his third attempt to achieve knighthood and he has gotten closer each time.
 While he is the odds on favorite to achieve it this year, no one wants him to win,” she said.
 “I went and chatted with him,” she continued “and he hates the Immortalists, but is rather unpleasant and needs to take a bath.

I had just risked my life to help him and apparently while I was getting wired to save his ass, he had managed to get Oxy into my home and got high while I was working his undercover drug deal.
 Not only was I devastated, I was a sucker and a fool to have helped him.
 After all of the agony during detox, he was back on this shit and nothing had changed.
 My love for him and our effort and commitment to him as his parents wasn’t as strong as his desire to ingest Oxy.
 Brandon’s addiction to this drug was more powerful than anything I could offer and all the love Lisa and I could show.
 My wife woke to my screaming and she was as shocked as I was when I showed her the test results.
 Brandon had to want to get better.
 As he packed his meager belongings, I grabbed the hand held video player and replayed the footage I had taped of him detoxing.
 He begged me to stop the video as he could hear himself on it screaming in agony as his body craved this drug.
 Brandon was crying uncontrollably as he tried to look away from the video that I continued to shove in front of his face.

 “Nice try,” Seth whispered and I think he really meant it.
 Or maybe he was teasing me.
 It’s hard to tell in these situations.
 Seth brandished his sword.
 “My turn.” “Really, warrior?” Kojas said and laughed.
 His laugh was like a bunch of spiders running down my back.
 “You think your sword will do any more than the pathetic archer girl’s arrow?” “Hey,” I shouted, “I’m not a pathetic archer girl!” Oh course, the two ignored me.

You are judgment, Harruq.

 Harruq sheathed the swords and clipped them to his belt.
 He knelt as his head swirled.
 “Thank you, master.”
 “None are more deserving,” Qurrah said, putting an arm on his brother’s shoulder.
 “There is one, and it is you, Qurrah,” Velixar said.
 He pulled out one item more before closing the chest and shrinking it back to its original size.
 In his hand remained a long black whip that curled about as if alive.
 “Weapons may not be your preference, but I trust you will find some use for this.”

 “What will they do if I can’t protect myself?” His face was grim.
 He didn’t reply and I suddenly didn’t want him to.
 We settled onto the floor of the small den, our backs against the wall, the rock overhang blocking the light of the moon.

I suddenly remembered the pages I had burnt in the briar patch so long ago.
 Burnt before I’d read them.
 My eyes flashed open.
 I sat up, ignoring my spinning head, but the book was already gone.
 I glared at Chevelle.
 It must have been dreadful, because he nodded and backed away, his mouth tight.
 “Oh, Frey.” Ruby’s voice was low and soothing.
 I grimaced as I turned to her, not at all wanting what I was about to say.
 “Go ahead.” I closed my eyes as her jaw shifted.

It’s only,” I popped open my phone, “3pm.
 We still have the rest of the day.” I shoved the phone back in my pocket.
 “Hey, don’t take this personally, but we want to hang out alone.
 So…bye!” Jason said and jumped on his bike.
 Seth unchained his bike and rode off with him.
 I realized then that Seth had barely said anything the whole time, but he was already out of sight.
 I’d have to question him later.
 I sighed, “Well, at least we can hang out early.” “Well, while you were arguing with the boys I called home and they said you could come over now.” Emily flashed me one of her million-watt smiles.
 “Great!” I piped.
 “I’ll call home quickly to check with my parents.” I called home and my parents said I could go, which wasn’t much of a surprise.

Creating these conditions will require the establishment of new institutions and substantial investment in infra structure.
 In many of these countries, the press has freed itself from being solely an instrument of government, but television is still largely under state control.
 In the entire former USSR today there is no adequate agricultural extension service to transmit research findings from the laboratory to the field, especially to small private farmers.
 Poor communications systems are incapable of handling the large volume of telephone, fax, telex and computerized messages needed for commercial linkages with other countries.
 10.Catalytic initiatives can release social dynamism: Social change is facilitated and accelerated by initiatives to introduce or demonstrate new patterns of activity and behaviour appropriate to the goals of the transition.
 One of the most successful initiatives of the Russian government in recent years has been the distribution of millions of small private agricultural plots to urban and rural households.
 Since a food shortage in the urban areas was the most pressing problem and greatest source of anxiety for the population, the government took steps to distribute more than 16 million small private plots to urban and rural families, so that highly vulnerable households could produce at least a portion of their own food requirements.
 These plots now account for more than 50 per cent of vegetable production and 80 per cent of potato and fruit production in Russia.
 Transitions require changes in behaviour and the private plots became an activity in which millions of people could participate in order to augment their own living standards and alleviate national food shortages.
 Similar catalytic efforts are needed in other fields to engage the population actively in new and improved activities.

But he couldn't regret that decision.
 She'd probably let him make love to her, but she'd be devastated when it was over.
 Her morals were deeply ingrained, and the guilt would eat away at her.
 He loved her far too much to put her through that.
 But they couldn't go on like this.
 He'd always prided himself on his self-control, but living under the same roof with a woman he loved, a woman who begged for his kisses--that was too much.
 But he knew Marie didn't really understand.
 She thought that they could just kiss forever.
 If only he could convince her to stay here with him.
 He was sure that she'd eventually come to accept the fact that she wasn't going to be able to get back home, but he was afraid they'd end up making love before she'd reached that point.

The situation became particularly acute in developing countries, because of their predominately young populations and high population growth rates.
 Trends and Prospects
 ICPF refused to side with the pessimists who viewed unemployment as a terminal illness spreading rapidly through the entire world economic system.
 Its report presented evidence to dispel the twin myths that technological development and trade were net job destroyers.
 It traced the growth of employment opportunities through the 20th Century, a century of unprecedented technological development and commercial expansion, to show that this period has also been an era of unprecedented growth in the quantity and quality of employment opportunities.
 The report argued that the current surge in joblessness was a temporary result of the mismatch between the rates of surging population growth and expanding economic activity.
 It concurred that rising levels of unemployment constituted a serious problem that needed to be urgently addressed, but rejected the notion that it is an inevitable and incurable disease which the world must resign itself to passively suffer and endure.
 The Commission, therefore, developed and presented a comprehensive strategy for job-led economic growth.
 Over the past decade, changes in the employment picture lend credence to ICPF’s perspective.
 The American economy experienced a decade-long expansion, fuelling high levels of employment at home, while stimulating job growth throughout East Asia, attracting a massive influx of foreign technical workers and setting the stage for a global outsourcing boom which is still in its infancy.

He glanced around, trying to orientate himself, when he felt a sharp pain stab into his back.
 He spun, his whip lashing out as it burst into flame.
 It wrapped around the man’s neck, choking out death cries as his flesh seared and smoke filled his lungs.
 The only noise Qurrah heard was the sound of skin blistering and popping in the fire.
 At last the man crumpled, the bloodied shard of glass from the bottle still in his hand.
 “Damn it,” Qurrah said, wincing as he touched the cut on his back.
 It was wide but not deep.
 Painful too, he noticed as he took a few steps.
 Furious, he turned back to the corpse of the drunken man and smashed a fist against its chest.
 The body shriveled into dust, only the bones remaining.

Rodregas let go of the broken neck and stood quickly, trying to clear himself of the gore.
 Both slavers looked shocked at what had happened and Rodregas moved quickly to take advantage of their surprise.
 He went to the right and slammed his remaining sword into the Orqui.
 The slaver grunted with pain and surprise at his quick change of targets.
 Rodregas’ short sword caught him in the shoulder.
 The guard half fell and half stumbled away to safety.
 Rodregas turned to the final slaver and saw fear in his eyes.
 Then Rodregas looked around and saw that he was no longer facing just one remaining opponent, but now faced four including another Immortal Guard and three more slavers.
 He had hoped they could pick off enough with the Black Yew bows to keep odds like this against them.
 Rodregas glanced to the ground hoping to see the previous guard’s blue steel long sword.

The first few weeks, on his days off, we hung out at La Jolla Shores.
 While Eric worked, I often helped Cliff and Bill Torrey and their dad rebuild a ’56 Thunderbird.
 Sometimes I visited my cousin Jill at her Pacific Beach apartment.
 Jill was nineteen.
 One Friday evening, she hosted a party.
 I drank several beers, then invited somebody who reminded me of Karen Flagstad to join me for a cruise up the coast road to La Jolla.
 Her name was Kris.
 She would go with me, she said, if not for a babysitting job she had that night.
 After she left, I drank more beer.
 Then I drove to a Jack in the Box on the coast road and found Kris there, in a Ford, hanging onto my cousin Jill’s boyfriend, Jimmy Dixon.

Alec appeared immediately, paint-speckled and undeniably alive, from where he'd been working in his studio.
 "I really wish you'd just call for me when you need something.
 All of this moving around isn't going to help your back heal any more quickly."
 "You're not letting your injuries slow you down."
 It was a losing argument, but I hated being cooped up in bed all the time, and it was the only argument I had.
 Alec paused for a second to look down at the long, thick bandage wrapped around his middle.
 The gash of white cutting across his darkly tanned skin was uncomfortably similar to what I imagined his wound must have looked like just after Brandon had inflicted it.
 He sighed, but there wasn't any real frustration to the sound.
 "Our cases are hardly comparable.
 You know I heal more quickly than you do."

I wanted to ask what Alec meant, but it was more and more obvious he wasn't going to answer anything he didn't want to.
 We walked in comfortable silence for several minutes before turning off into what I could only assume was the Lilac Room.
 Donovan looked up as we entered the suite.
 "I trust your mother was well, sir?"
 Alec nodded, a short choppy motion that eloquently conveyed his desire not to discuss the matter.
 He turned towards me, only to break off as a cell phone rang.
 "It's for you, probably your mom.
 Pretend you're home, I'll explain once you're finished."
 I almost dropped the phone, and probably wouldn't have managed to figure out how to answer the call in time if he hadn't reached over and pushed the green button for me.

She dropped her voice to a conspiratorial whisper.
 "I actually prefer they do.
 That way when their parents phone in to complain about how poorly they did on the exam, I can point out that the lab was open for another hour, but they didn't bother to stick around for the extra help."
 It was a speech that made her sound like a grouchy old lady, but I was starting to know her well enough to take it in the proper context.
 She would gladly have done just about anything to help a student who really wanted to learn, but was tired of having students try and use her as an excuse for their own laziness.
 I waved goodbye to everyone as they left, and then made a quick round of the remaining students.
 Rachel and Britney were both in their accustomed places, Rachel studying away as always, and Britney making some weak efforts to do likewise.
 Two of the other three, a boy and a girl I recognized from second hour, but whose names I couldn't even begin to remember, were already packing their books into a pair of book bags, one of which was a fairly utilitarian item, the other of which probably cost as much as my whole wardrobe.
 I couldn't place the last boy for all that he looked really familiar.
 He had incredibly dark skin and features with a slight Middle Eastern cast.

He knew this was all too good to last, but knowing that it would not last also made it more important that he enjoy the moment.
 Rodregas was free.
 He was being hunted; but hunted because he had finally dealt out justice.
 He had killed two monsters, two who wore faces not their own, and who he could feel no remorse for killing.
 Rodregas had finally escaped to his quiet place in the mountains to rest and, best of all, with two companions who seemed to be good people.
 Clearly, Doi’van had a dark side and he knew little of either of his companions.
 But it had been a long time since he had wanted to know more about anyone that he met.
 Rodregas had a new strong and powerful body, and he owed a great debt of guilt for that.
 He had even been able to free prisoners and give them a second chance at life.
 How many times had he dreamed of that while the prisoners had pleaded with him?

 No, it must be me, but unrecognizable.
 Not unrecognizable, a voice inside me whispered.
 My hair was dark and windblown.

I watched as he crept around the back of a small hut, knowing that if he was hiding, I definitely didn’t want to get caught here.
 He leapt into a rear window and I followed as low and slow as I could.
 When I reached the last tree I could use for cover, I darted up against the hut and peered through a gap in the twigs that patched it together.
 They were whispering.
 “… mustn’t let them find you… shouldn’t have come…” It was dim inside, but I caught a glimpse of a figure through the wall.
 Junnie.
 Chevelle was whispering his reply to her, and though I couldn’t quite hear, he must have given her a short account of the morning’s events.
 I moved closer to the window, finding a larger gap there.
 “Were you able to track her?” Junnie asked in a low voice.

 Ahhh.
 Those soft, slender hands imitated what she'd felt him do to her, rubbing and caressing.
 He only wished he could get her to do his chest as well so that he could gaze up at her as she ran her hands over him.

 Davis was her fiancé, and she had no business kissing Rick, no business sitting in his kitchen in nothing but his pajama top.
 Reddening, Marie set her glass down and headed for the stairs.
 “I’m going to take a shower.” She couldn’t believe what she’d done.
 She could almost excuse herself for kissing Rick in Hollywood, say that he’d been part of the dream.
 But this morning .

It opened up an insular society and exposed it to an avalanche of new information, new ideas and new possibilities, which released a fervent aspiration in the people for a better life.
 Over the last few years, democratization has been especially dynamic in Africa, where it has been dubbed Africa’s Second Liberation.
 During the first three decades of post-colonial independence, almost all of the continent’s 54 states had come under either single-party or military rule.
 The preference for authoritarian rule was often justified by the need for rapid economic development, which could be impeded by opposition to government policies and by the need to contain regional and tribal conflicts.
 Neither of these claims has proven true.
 Living standards have actually declined in most African countries during the last two decades.
 Regional and tribal politics have flourished.
 Dozens of civil and inter-state wars have been fought, accounting for millions of lost lives.
 Food production and employment have lagged far behind population growth.
 In the absence of legal channels of protest, opposition parties have frequently resorted to violence.

He wasn't doing either, in fact, he seemed to be very much involved in a conversation with the stocky boy on his right.
 The rest of the kids at the table were listening just as intensely, all except for the brunette on Brandon's left who was looking in our direction.
 My face pulled back in a smile, I even brought my hand partway up in a wave before I realized I recognized her.
 It was the trendy girl from the office, and she apparently still didn't like me.
 I felt my face get even hotter, only now I was both angry and embarrassed.
 It was a relief to sink down into a chair with my back to Brandon and his friends.
 Strangely enough, Britney also being so obviously uncomfortable helped calm me down.
 "Okay, out with it, why is this such a big deal?"
 Britney shifted back and forth in her seat for a couple of seconds before leaning in to whisper.
 "It really shouldn't be a big deal, but everyone around here acts like it's taboo.

Junnie was older than I, but remained striking with the blonde hair, blue eyes, and thin features that seemed to be standard-issue among the village elves.
 The Council had assigned her as my tutor, citing my advanced age as the reason I couldn’t learn with the others, but I suspected it was my stunning lack of ability that had landed me here.
 Junnie brushed a lock of hair aside.
 “There you are, my Fredora!” She was always trying out new nicknames for me.
 It was no secret I despised my given name: Elfreda Georgiana Suzetta Glaforia.
 I decided, not for the first time, my father must have been a drunken imp.
 Not that I could remember him, but I could definitely blame him because the father was always responsible for naming the firstborn.
 It wasn’t as if you could get more unoriginal than using the ancient word meaning “elf”, but he certainly hadn’t needed to follow it with a string of ridiculous, flowery—I stopped mid-thought, realizing my tutor was watching me.
 “Hey, Junnie,” I said, forcing a smile.
 “What’s on the schedule for today?” She smiled in return, straightening the deep blue sash that tied her tunic.

But as much as she enjoyed the "E.T."
 ride, it couldn't compare to the "Back to the Future" ride.
 That was really like flying--even more than in the airplane.
 It was more like having wings of her own, soaring high and low, below bridges and over mountains.
 "We really never left the ground?"
 she asked Rick as they waited to ride it a second time.
 "No.
 The car just jerks us around, and that combined with the effect of the picture makes you feel like you're flying."
 "Did you like it?"
 "Yeah--it was fun.

It hardly bothered me when Britney snubbed me during English.
 I flew through my Algebra assignment, finishing up the one from yesterday as well as the one Mrs. Campbell assigned, before the bell rang to release us.
 The only thing that even threatened my bubble of happiness was when I walked into the lunchroom and saw that Britney was sitting with the cheerleaders who'd come and sat at our table yesterday.
 It was blatantly obvious I wasn't welcome.
 Unsure where to sit, I almost spun around and walked back into the hall until Brandon caught my eye and waved me over.
 I had to detour around the tangle of tables that belonged to the closest thing Sanctuary had to real Goths.
 My wandering path brought me around to where I could see what I'd mentally dubbed 'Alec's corner'.
 It was a good thing there was an empty chair nearby.
 The force of Jasmin's stare was almost a palpable thing; my knees got weak so quickly it was like she'd reached out and pushed me.
 I steadied myself and then tried to ignore the way my skin crawled as I crossed the rest of the distance to Brandon's table.

The situation of the countries in transition in Eastern Europe, high lighted in this report, illustrates perfectly the need for an integrated approach to development considered as a total human process.
 The Commission's report contains specific proposals in this regard as well as an overview pointing to existing domestic assets of various kinds which could help the countries concerned.
 It addresses the topic of job creation with innovative ideas on the roles of technology and trade, and emphasizes the significance of the developing countries and agricul ture in the world economy.
 Its global education programme proposal placing appropriate emphasis on the key issue of girls' and women's education is one that particularly commends itself to UNESCO, which is already actively engaged in efforts along similar lines in conjunction with its UN partners.
 This timely report should help to promote the idea of human-centred development within a culture of peace as a way forward to a better world.
 We are gratified that ICPF should have assigned UNESCO, as the intellectual arm of the United Nations, a prominent role in its recommended agenda for action, and we reaffirm our commit ment to working with all possible partners in pursuit of the goal of global peace and sustainable human development.
 Federico Mayor Director General UNESCO
 The International Commission on Peace and Food began its work at a time of uncommon opportunities for rapid transition on a global scale to democratic ways of life, freedom of the media, and an independent judiciary; food, literacy, health and jobs for all; and sustainable life styles based on harmony between humankind and nature.
 The end of the Cold War and the consequent shift of expenditure from defence to development, the onset of the Information Age and the organization of information superhighways, the growth of mechanisms for regional cooperation, a renewed faith in the United Nations, and commitment to multilateral negotiations and action all provided new opportunities for achieving global peace and prosperity.
 Rapid progress in the application of science and technology in agriculture, industry, and human health strengthened the hope that the concept of 'food, education, health and employment for all' can be converted from rhetoric into reality, provided the peace dividend can be deployed to achieve these goals.

I just wanted to get on with it and go home in one piece.
 It was an odd sight for me as I watched these officers chow down their burgers and sip on their drinks reminiscing about the drug deal they just finished.
 Just another day at the office, I guess.
 In a moment, my crack-berry starts to blow up with one call after the next from Ashley, wanting to know when we are doing this deal.
 I must keep buying time with excuses, now nearing a two-hour delay waiting for the cops to come from the other bust.
 It is looking like this deal is not going to happen either.
 I answer some of the calls and ignore others as I am instructed to do by Officer White.
 I whisper in one call as if I can’t talk because I am still stuck at home with my wife and cannot talk freely.
 I reassure Ashley that I will meet her as soon as I can get out.
 I think of my wife and son at home wondering why I haven’t called; is it over?

This growing gap between expectations and achievements is at the root of contemporary turbulence worldwide.
 The popular and some times violent demand for freedom and participatory democracy, the return of religion in politics, surging ethno-nationalism and intolerance, and rising urban crime are disparate expressions of this phenomenon.
 In Eastern Europe, where a peaceful revolution from within has broken the shackles of statism that long confined the energies of people, these energies now surge forward in high and eager expectations of a better life.
 Already there are growing signs of impatience, disappointment and frustration arising from the greater hardships that have come in place of the greater benefits that all expected.
 It is essential that these energies be channelled into constructive pursuits that generate tangible improvements.
 Otherwise they may recoil from the effort and look backwards to a failed system or be guided by false prophets on a path that once again poses a threat to other nations.
 The phenomenon of growing violence in an age of increasing affluence seems to contradict the thesis that poverty is one of the major causes of violence, until we realize that the increasingly visible signs of prosperity the world over raise the expectations and aggravate the sense of deprivation and revolt among those that have been by-passed by the general progress.
 Greater political and social freedom can only further magnify this tendency.
 This suggests that violence at the international, national and community levels cannot and will not be eradicated before poverty itself has been abolished, and that, if poverty is left unaddressed at its source, further economic progress is likely further to aggravate conflict in society, unless we are able to extend the benefits of progress to everyone.
 This realization would be quite disconcerting were it not for the fact that we are fast approaching the time when both these persistent ills of humankind can be banished forever – the way slavery and colonialism were banished in the past.

And he kept asking, “What can we do?” As if our mission was to fix all the world’s broken people.
 Eric was the fastest middle-distance runner in our school.
 Baseball was my best game.
 But Eric and I had alienated some coaches.
 Me for quitting the baseball and football teams, soon after my dad died, so I could go instead to Singing Hills, a country club where Tommy Rupnik, a golf pro and friend of my dad’s let me play for free.
 Most every day, I traipsed through the woods alongside a stream and clobbered golf balls.
 Eric had angered coaches for walking away from the wrestling team after he lost a match and Coach Feezer belittled him.
 The coaches believed Eric had quit out of wounded pride.
 The truth was, disappointing people wracked him with shame.
 We wanted to rejoin the teams that year.

But that's because it's been like a holiday, a visit.
 If I thought that I weren't going home--"  Her voice caught.
 "I understand."
 Rick nuzzled her temple.
 "But now that you're not going to marry Davis, will you at least stop feeling guilty when we kiss?"
 She smiled.
 "I like your kisses."
 "I like yours too."
 He pressed his lips to hers.
 Marie nestled close to him, hoping he'd kiss her like he had last time.

“I thank you for sparring with me,” she told him.
 “It’s nothing,” he said.
 “Better to spar with someone than practice alone.”
 Aurelia smiled.
 “You’re different than what I expected, Harruq.
 Smarter, too.”
 Harruq blushed.
 “No need for lies,” he said.
 The elf laughed a little but said nothing.
 Instead, she walked over and gave Harruq a quick peck on the cheek.

 She shivered.
 She would give anything to be able to make love with Rick.
 Well, almost anything.
 She had to go home.
 She jumped when she heard Rick's door open.
 Glancing at him, she turned and headed downstairs.
 Rick followed her, wondering if she was mad or embarrassed or confused.
 Most women would never again speak to a man who had rejected her touch.
 But most women would have known exactly what they were doing.

 "Nothing," he gasped, sweeping her into his arms.
 "I-I just got worried when I woke up and you were gone."
 "I decided to get dressed and make breakfast before I woke you up.
 I wanted to let you sleep as late as possible."
 "Is-is there still time for you to walk?"
 "Yes.
 It's barely 7:00."
 She pushed away from him, looking up at him anxiously.
 "How are you feeling?"

I shook my head, more or less speechless, and he reached out and playfully tapped the side of my face with one finger.
 The touch left my skin warm and tingling.
 "That's what's so amazing about you.
 Almost everyone else at school was born here.
 They essentially look at every action as choosing between Alec and I. Britney, who could have legitimately stayed neutral, has been trying to get in my good graces almost since she arrived.
 You, on the other hand, couldn't care less who has the most money."
 It was an explanation.
 Not an iron-clad one, but good enough for now.
 I thanked Brandon for the ride, and was rewarded with one more wide, open smile before we split up and headed our separate ways.
 I kept telling myself not to get caught up in the idea of being with someone for the first time in my life, but still went through the first two classes more or less in a daze.

For the longest of time, silence.
 His shoulder pounded with each heartbeat; his chest screamed with each breath.
 Colors swam across his eyes.
 His ears, incredibly sensitive even compared to other elves, strained for the sound of approaching dead.
 He heard nothing but a strange ringing inside his skull.
 It seemed he had put more distance between them than he first thought.
 A footstep fell beside his head.
 His heart and lungs halted.
 The pain had diminished his skills.
 They were atop him, but he dared not move.

Historically, all landmark changes in the international political and security system have been the result of armed conflicts, wars and revolutions.
 In each case the victors who emerged from the ashes of war sought to build on a static formula for enforcing peace in a dynamic world.
 In each case, the arrangements for conflict termination contained a dynamism that would produce the tensions, disputes and conflicts of the future.
 These in-built limitations and imbalances resist adjustment until a new round of fighting sweeps away the old frame work and replaces it with another, fashioned in much the same way.
 This has been true of the arrangements for international security which have governed international affairs during the present century and which provided the underlying dynamism for the First World War and, when the failed attempt at forming a League of Nations left the world unprepared to deal with fascism, for the Second World War as well.
 The skewed division of powers allotted under the UN Charter contained the seeds for the bipolar, intensely adversarial relationship between the two military blocs that resulted in the Cold War and the arms race between the superpowers.
 All these arrangements have been based on the concept of competitive security.
 The competitive security paradigm is a state-centred, egocentric approach in which the security of each nation is perceived in terms of its military superiority over potential adversaries.
 The push of each nation for unlimited security through military power is inherently destabilizing, since it inevitably increases the level of insecurity of other sovereign states.
 In practice, the effort of nations to arm themselves against perceived external threats generates a sense of insecurity among other nations and compels them in turn to increase military preparedness, thus initiating a vicious spiral, as it did during the Cold War.

The experience of the past four decades strongly supports the view that government can play a vital role in stimulating agriculture up to the stage where the rural economy demonstrates the dynamism needed to take off on its own.
 Although the Green Revolution has been widely heralded as an achievement of modern technology, the hybrid seeds and chemical-based cultivation practices that formed the technological basis for the breakthrough in foodgrain production constitute only one part of a comprehensive, integrated development strategy in which government played a central and crucial role.
 This strategy included massive, country-wide demonstration programmes to introduce farmers to new technology, the establishment of new public sector agencies for rapid multiplication and distribution of seeds, assured markets and guaranteed floor prices for foodgrains to eliminate fear that higher production would result in crashing prices, construction of additional storage capacity to house the increased production, import or manufacture of fertilizers, and, most importantly, for transport, distribution and marketing of surplus grains in food deficit areas.
 Few developing countries – perhaps few countries at any stage of development – could have marshalled resources on such a massive scale and instituted such widespread changes so rapidly without heavy reliance on the government for both planning and execution.
 In the majority of developing countries, government is still the most organized and efficient agency and the only one capable of such significant initiative.
 In formulating strategies, it is essential to take fully into account both the stages and steps of the development process.
 At this stage in their development, it is highly unlikely that food-deficit African nations can make rapid progress toward food self-sufficiency without strong government support and investment to improve technology, training, techno-infrastructure and trade.
 Once the rural sector begins to exhibit its own dynamism, as in the majority of developing countries, there is strong justification for a shift in the role of government from that of prime mover, planner and controller of development to that of catalyst and pioneer.
 Government agencies can tap the potentials of agriculture, identifying new commercial opportunities, educating farmers, demonstrating new potentials, assisting in the transfer and dissemination of new technology, and promoting the establishment of effective organizations – preferably privately or co-operatively owned by farmers or at least with their participation – to process, distribute and market what is produced.
 Coping with the environmental problems to preserve the ecological foundations essential for sustainable agriculture is an area in which government has special responsibilities and must play a leading role on an ongoing basis.

The revelation was a bit of a shock.
 I'd known all along they were both ridiculously rich, but them owning the livelihood of nearly every person in the town was mind-boggling.
 Brandon seemed to know where my thoughts were headed.
 "Pretty amazing, huh?
 Anyways, I've been raised to believe I have an obligation to the town, to the people who work for us.
 Part of that includes making sure other people with substantial resources don't abuse their power."
 It was probably about as good of a chance to find out what was going on under the surface as I was going to get, but something inside me shied away.
 It was like I'd be entering a new world, one in which some of my illusions would be shattered.
 I'd have to face a colder interpretation of certain people's actions.
 Brandon successfully defused any awkwardness, chuckling as he pulled into the school parking lot.

 Finally Emily opened her mouth and said, “What are you thinking about?” “What?” The question had caught me by complete surprise.
 “What are you thinking about?” she repeated.
 “Surely you must be thinking something; we’re going to some ‘other world’!” I closed my eyes.
 “I was just wondering what it would be like in Igneeria.
 What about you?” “Well,” she said thoughtfully, “I was thinking about Kojas-” “Emily don’t say his name, I don’t feel like being yelled at again.” I interrupted her.
 “Fine,” she said, a little annoyed.
 “I was thinking about him, if I must call him that, and what he’s like.” I rolled my eyes.
 “Emily isn’t it obvious; he’s evil for crying out loud.
 That’s why we have to go and stop him.” “I know that Jazell, gosh, but I was wondering what he looks like.” “I don’t want to know,” I said.

 He squeezed his eyes shut but was unable to keep tears from seeping out at the thought of Marie married to someone else.
 "I don't want to marry anyone else!"
 Her sobs became louder, and she wrapped her arms around him.
 "But you will.
 And so will I.
 We're both young.
 We'll end up settling for someone we love less than we love each other, just so we won't be alone."

Unfortunately, Mom's hearing was nearly as good as mine, and she was walking towards the windows before I managed to get the door open.
 "Adri, who's that?"
 It was obviously one of those leading questions designed to see whether or not I'd try to lie.
 I shrugged.
 "His name is Brandon; he picks me up sometimes in the morning."
 I was saved from dealing with her response by Brandon's knock.
 "Hello, Adriana, Mrs.
 Paige."
 I never thought I'd see the like.
 Mom's face lost its stern 'I'm doing this for your own good' look, and instead transformed into something not very different from what I saw every time I watched the girls my age look at Brandon.

 But as the fog began to lift, she could tell that she was still in 2011.
 The house to her left didn't look like any house she'd ever seen before yesterday.
 And she was no longer in a garden--she was walking across a lawn.
 She wanted to keep walking, but with the fog disappearing and no garden in sight, she was afraid it was useless.
 She turned around, eyes down as she headed back to Rick's house.
 How would she get back?
 Was she stuck here?
 Her parents must be out of their minds with fear.
 And Davis--he was probably tearing the city apart looking for her.

I couldn’t understand why he was affecting me this way.
 The pages stuffed in my shirt felt like fire against my skin.
 I quickened my pace, caught my toe on a root, and stumbled.
 As soon as I righted myself, I wasn’t able to stop myself from peeking back to see if he had noticed, but he was gone.
 I didn’t know if I was relieved.
 My mind went over the encounter again as I made my way home.
 Did he always wear such a stern expression?
 Why was he looking at me so intensely?
 But I had my answer: Because you keep staring at him, fool.
 It seemed to me Fannie always knew when I didn’t want to be bothered and went out of her way to ensure I was.

 Come read my newspaper.” “We have our own.”  She turned to escape.
 He caught her wrist.
 “Wait.
 I’m not going to hurt you.
 You-you don’t know how to get home, do you?”  When she didn’t respond, he said, “Just come look at my newspaper.
 You don’t have to come inside.
 Just sit on my veranda, and when the fog lifts, we’ll-we’ll see if we can find your house.” Afraid of becoming even more lost, she hesitantly followed him to some chairs and perched on the edge of one.

 “The penguins?” “Does that really matter?” she hissed.

When our goddess imprisoned the two gods, she cursed those elves.
 She stripped them of their beauty, their intelligence, and their long life.
 They weren’t evil, Harruq, but Karak offered them strength and they accepted it.
 The dark god drove them to war against elves and men.
 Finally the orcs were banished to the Vile Wedge between the rivers.”
 “Do any still worship Karak?”
 “Most don’t,” Aurelia said.
 “They’ve turned to worshipping animals now.
 I’ve even heard of some worshipping Celestia once more, hoping she will forgive them and remove their curse.
 They are a sad race, Harruq, but believe me in saying there is no shame in your blood.”

All the guards had been confused as to why Ravenhurr had kept him, as it was against the Guild rules to use any of the Hellborn in the ceremony.
 The Immortalist was trying to become Celestial not a member of the Infernal realms.
 It was a very stringent rule that everyone knew not to break, not that any of the guards was going to mention it to the Guild.
 “Who are you?” asked the man that Rodregas had tagged as ‘the leader.’ “I am not sure who I am,” Rodregas responded.
 “And I think I will keep any answers that I figure out to myself for now.” “You are not Gerald though are you?” asked the AElf maiden.
 “Not to ask a dumb question,” Rodregas asked in a curious tone “but who is Gerald?”  Silence followed his query but finally he got an answer.
 “He is the man that you appear to be, whose body you now… have,” responded the maiden.
 “And what are you five named?” Rodregas asked.
 There was a pause at his question.
 He knew this was an important moment because once people say who they are they are much less likely to do violence.

“Outside,” came Qurrah’s muffled reply.
 Harruq stretched, pushed away a plank of wood from the window, and climbed out.
 The sun was halfway visible, the standard noises of the city only in their infancy.
 Leaning against the shed, his eyes staring off toward the sunrise, waited Qurrah.
 “What are you doing out here?” Harruq asked.
 “Did you sense it?” Qurrah asked.
 “Sense what?”
 The smaller half-orc shook his head.
 “If you must ask then you did not, at least not directly, though I did hear you startle awake.
 Perhaps a fleeting glimpse of it…”

“Jazell, Emily and Jason!” Crystalla beamed.
 “I’m so happy you can finally join us!” Crystalla was dressed in a hunting jacket with a dark blue top underneath.
 She had dark green pants with simple brown boots.
 A gleaming sword was slung on her back.
 My heart ached because she somewhat resembled Seth.
 Man, I missed his stubbornness.
 “Yup we’re happy too,” Emily said with a sigh.
 “So, um, what did you need?” I asked.
 She nodded.
 “Right, you must meet your destiny.

Do you wish now that you were at home, curled up with a book?” “Yes.” *** “Seth,” I said, “calm down and think.
 We can’t stay here forever, and pace.”Seth didn’t stop and he started mumbling under his breath.
 I walked up and pushed him around.
 “Seth, you have to think.
 Kojas did this on purpose, he’s trying to weaken us by splitting us up.
 He wants us to go running to him.” “I know what he’s trying to do, it’s driving me crazy.
 The nerve of this guy.” “Faery,” I corrected him.
 “He’s not a ‘guy’, he’s some demon faery.
 Calling him ‘guy’ makes it sound like he’s just a normal human.” “Does it matter right now?” he asked, through clenched teeth.
 I looked away.

I am a great warrior, but I like to learn new things and I would like to have sufficient magic to be able to learn spells.” Rodregas nodded.
 Doi’van’s response would have surprised him before, but he had learned much of the thoughtful Hellborn in their time together.
 When one looked at him and how powerfully built he was, it was incredible to imagine what he could do on the battlefield with a greater sigil added to his power.
 He would be a true daemon on the battlefield.
 But while Doi’van loved his strength, he also loved his intelligence.
 In comparison, Rodregas was less interested in exploring learning as he was about what he could do as a warrior and carrying out his duty.
 “Well,” Rodregas said, “I don’t think we are going to have any options for sigils for now.
 Let us continue to learn what we can of battle and of magic.
 If we are lucky we can worry about more if we survive our first strike at the Immortalists.” The next morning, during his meditation, Rodregas realized that it was time for action.
 He realized that if they continued simply to hide out in the farmhouse, winter would come and travel would be much more difficult.

Can we wait to celebrate until after school?"
 Now it was her turn to look guilty and fidget just a little bit.
 "Actually, that's why I wanted to talk to you this morning.
 I've been shooting that new place I left you the note about.
 The one that bunch of kids your age told me about.
 Anyways, it's the best place I've found so far.
 I've been shooting it at pretty much all hours, but I think I need to get higher up for the shot I want."
 I knew exactly where this was going.
 Actually, I was kind of relieved she wasn't going to be around this afternoon.
 Birthdays are supposed to be special.

My head cleared, but Chevelle still held me around the arms.
 My neck flushed, my eyes shooting to my lap.
 I couldn’t look at him.
 What am I doing?
 The door opened and Chevelle’s hands dropped as he stood to face the newcomer.
 “They are here.” It was Steed’s voice, but I didn’t raise my head, the blood still hot in my cheeks.
 “Take her to the ridge, I will meet you after…” Chevelle stopped midsentence.
 After what?
 Steed must have been concerned because Chevelle explained, “Ruby gave her a little dust… to relax.” “Frey,” Steed said from beside me.
 I glanced at the door.

I handed the dark red stone to Chevelle, who only nodded as he took it from me, not examining it before he slipped it into a pocket to hide it away.
 There was a sound at the door and his fingers slid over my lower back, urging me into my room.
 I was closed in just as the main door opened, giving me no more than a glimpse of deep red curls.
 I tried not to be annoyed about being closed in a room.
 I was a prisoner after all.
 Chevelle’s voice was barely audible as he spoke to his visitor in a formal tone.
 “Ruby.” Ruby?
 Before I could stop myself, I was at the door peering through the frame.
 A tiny crack of light allowed me about three-quarters of Chevelle’s back and all of his guest.
 Ruby.

East Asia alone, excluding Japan and China, will spend about $900 billion on infrastructure between 1992 and 2000.
 During this decade, China and India will add 21,000 megawatts of electricity generation every year and more telephone switching capacity than the United States and Japan combined.
 Latin America’s annual requirements for investment in power, water and sewage, telecommunications and transport infrastructure are estimated at $60 billion.
 Rising incomes and increasing exports to the dynamic economies of Asia and Latin America could generate as many as 1.7 million jobs by the end of the decade in the United States alone.
 The growth of the developing economies could provide the major impetus for economic expansion and job creation in both developed and developing countries.
 Government policies based on recognition of this fact can considerably improve the climate for development of these nations and correspondingly stimulate further growth in the West.
 Freer international trade will generate a flood of cheaper goods from the developing world that will give rise not only to greater purchasing power and higher standards of living for the Western consumer, but also to a ‘demand boom’ for sophis ticated Western goods and services to improve infrastructure and meet the needs of billions of consumers in developing countries.
 The vast inequalities in living standards that persist within both developing and industrial nations, and between the most and least economically developed countries, result in an enormous global loss of incomes and jobs.
 Accelera ting the development of poorer nations and poorer sections of the population in each country is the most powerful instrument and the surest guarantee of continued growth of jobs and incomes for everyone in the next century.

The intense heat felt like a physical blow.
 I could almost feel my pores open up in an effort to keep me from overheating.
 The sensory overload as my eyes tried to adjust to the unfiltered afternoon sun momentarily distracted me.
 It wasn't until I heard the other door swing shut that I realized James had followed us through, but he'd taken the door on the right instead of the one of the left that I'd been holding open for him.
 Wow, talk about a chauvinistic pig.
 It wasn't worth getting bent out of shape.
 I let my door swing shut, and walked over to Rachel's side so that I could see the entire parking lot.
 Empty as it was, it didn't take very long to realize Britney's little white Saturn was gone.
 "I thought you might still be here."
 The voice caught me by surprise.

I am unable to see in the tinted windows of the car but I am certain they can see me; I stare back as if to say, “Is that you?” They are obviously aware that I am there, alone and awaiting their arrival.
 The car slowly pulls away after taking a good look at me.
 I lose sight of them, as they seem to be going towards the opposite end of the parking lot.
 I assume they will pull around after checking out the surroundings but instead my crack-berry rings within seconds.
 It is Ashley and she is trying to move me to a Starbucks that is on the other side of the same parking lot.
 I resist and ask her if that was her that stopped next to me in the red Dodge Charger.
 She says it was but she would rather meet at the Starbucks where there are some people around.
 I tell her to just come to my truck and let’s get this deal done.
 Ashley states she is suspicious that I won’t drive a hundred yards to meet her.
 I make a judgment call that I know will not make the undercover narcotics team happy but she is right, what is my great reason justifying not driving a short distance?

Lamps were lit here and there, casting shadows across the road.
 Harruq stayed far from Celed, the elven side of town, since they sent all their children to be raised in Nellassar, deep in the heart of the Erze forest.
 It was the human children, especially the poor and the destitute, that Harruq sought.
 Of course, none would be out playing, not with so many dead and missing.
 He would need to take different measures.
 Not far from their home, a ratty building operated throughout the night.
 It was Maggie’s Place, half tavern and half orphanage.
 Maggie enjoyed the free labor and the ability to rant and slap her orphan workers without fear of reprisal while still maintaining the image of a heart of gold to her regulars.
 The tavern filled the first floor, while the orphanage and a few modest rooms for rent composed the second.
 Harruq stepped into the alley beside the tavern and looked up.

There are a lot of strong personalities down there."
 Alec's chuckle wasn't really amused.
 "You could say that.
 At first it seemed like things changed up on a daily basis.
 Then Jasmin manifested her royal wolf form and things settled down a little."
 We were venturing into unknown territory for me.
 Alec was usually so careful to keep me sheltered from his world.
 "Was Jasmin dominant then?
 I mean if she was a royal wolf and you hadn't manifested your hybrid form yet did she win all of the fights?"
 Alec rested his cheek on the top of my head.

“I think I need to change shields,” he said.
 Doi’van glanced at what remained of Rodregas’ shield and simply nodded and handed him one of their other shields.
 It was not in great shape, but it was whole.
 Rodregas watched a few of the other matches before it was his turn again.
 Except for him, everyone remaining wore full plate.
 Rodregas’ next opponent was shining in the sun in his steel; which was better than him having to face Night Bronze plate, but still not very reassuring.
 The flag fell and Rodregas dug his heals into Doom Hoof’s side and the mount plodded forward.
 His opponent’s horse looked almost as powerful, but much faster.
 The collision happened before Rodregas was fully expecting it and he felt himself hit the ground and hit it hard.
 “Great,” Rodregas muttered to himself, “He has a Dire Steed and full plate armor.” Rodregas rolled over and pushed himself up, Doom Hoof stood nosing the sand looking for food.

For a second I worried I was going to pass out, but movement behind the two punks distracted me from my heaving internal landscape.
 There was just enough light for me to see Alec lean forward and put a hand on each troublemaker's shoulder.
 There was an abortive movement by the two loudmouths, as they tried to spin around and confront him.
 Granted, the lighting was less than ideal, but it didn't look like Alec was holding onto them very hard.
 Still, neither of them made it more than a quarter of the way around before being slammed back down into their chairs.
 The tingly heat that'd convinced me Alec was staring at me earlier was back, and even more intense.
 I felt the tiny hairs on my neck stand up as the feeling redoubled yet again.
 The darker, more vocal of the two opened his mouth and got the first part of a swear word out before ending in a hiss of pain that was almost completely drowned out by a crescendo from the orchestra pit.
 Alec leaned forward, whispered something in each of their ears, and then finally let both of them go.
 I expected them to turn around swinging, or at least swear at him.

His stomach growled as the aroma of cooked meat filled his nostrils.
 “Glad you approve,” Qurrah said.
 They ate in silence until only bones remained, which Qurrah then tucked away in a pouch.
 Harruq relaxed and enjoyed the heat while his brother tightened his robe and leaned toward the fire.
 “Things are more dangerous now, aren’t they?” Harruq asked after a pause.
 Qurrah nodded, his thoughts distant.
 “They’re ready for us.
 Many elves will be lurking inside the woods as they hunt for the Forest Butcher.” Again Qurrah chuckled at the name his brother had earned.
 “Will we stop for a while?” Harruq asked.
 The smaller half-orc shook his head.

The nobleman struggled against the ropes, his gaze locked on the sky.
 “Please, no, take it away, I’ll do anything, anything, just keep it away.
 Don’t let it touch me, please, please, DON’T LET IT TOUCH ME!”
 The man screamed for the next two minutes.
 Then he died.
 “What did you do to him?” Harruq asked once the man was dead.
 “Fear is an entertaining weapon, is it not?”
 The warrior shook his head in wonder, but Qurrah said no more.
 “Do we leave the bodies here?” Harruq asked.
 The necromancer trotted over to the dead noble and did not answer.

She smiled, but all at once her smile dissolved into an uncomfortable blush.
 "Rick," she began hesitantly, "will you have to tell her that-that I'm living with you?"
 "No."
 He raised her knuckles to his lips.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart—I never considered that living here with me might make you uncomfortable."
 "It doesn't.
 I feel as safe with you as I do in my own home.
 I just--it's just that no one else would understand."
 "Well, don't worry about Teri.
 I won't tell her, and she's going to love you."

She didn't want me at their table.
 The only reason she'd stopped by my locker was because Brandon had told her to.
 "Thanks, but I have some studying to do.
 I'd better just find a quiet corner."
 The smile I received was sickly sweet, but left me with the impression I'd just failed a test.
 "Okay, we'll see you another day then?"
 I pulled out my Spanish and Biology books, more because they were the two subjects I was doing the worst in than out of any real desire to study them, and wandered the halls until Mr. Whethers took pity on me and asked if I wanted to study in his classroom.
 Sitting there all by myself felt so lonely.
 When you boiled it all down, I had a grand total of two friends in Sanctuary.
 Rachel and Brandon, both of who seemed to dislike the other, and neither of whom I was really sure I could count on.

 “It is a select few who have received such a gift,” Velixar said in the quiet night.
 “You have heard the voice of the dark god himself.
 Now tell me, what is it you saw?”
 “Please, brother,” Qurrah said.
 “I need to know.”
 Harruq stared at the dirt, each breath making his shoulders heave.
 His mind reeled, and for reasons he did not understand, he opened his mouth and said, “That which I fear and desire.
 I have had no questions answered, but I do know this: the time for questions has long ended.”
 Velixar nodded.

It gathered in my hair, leaving it a matted mess with the single braid—Ruby’s handiwork—dripping condensation over the shoulder of my cloak.
 I decided to practice as we rode, closing my eyes to sink partially into my horse, still alert to my own self and the outside world.
 It was there, leading my horse and seeing through his eyes, that the pain struck.
 It came on instantaneously, hitting me like a blade, cutting, shearing.
 It was accompanied by sharpness of sound as well.
 My ears were in excruciating pain.
 The horse dropped, his head smacked to the ground and I watched through his eyes as he hit.
 The animal’s senses stilled, not panicked as my own.
 I didn’t understand what was happening, couldn’t quite form a thought.
 I yearned to retreat into the horse, run from the agony, but the severity of it tore me back and kept me there in my own head.

If I could get the pair of them to spend some time together it would probably go a long ways towards patching up the stupid feud Alec seemed so determined to keep alive.
 I thought about broaching the idea with Rachel, but discarded the notion immediately.
 She would just clam up, just like she always did whenever anything relating to her brother was mentioned.
 I'd have to be sneaky to get the two of them together.
 Mrs. Campbell needed a little bit of reassuring when she stopped by my desk, which I did happily now that my personal universe was looking up once again, and then I dug into my homework with near-normal gusto.
 Time flew by all too quickly.
 Soon it was just me holding down the fort and trying to take care of a trio of freshmen girls who seemed to be at least slightly ahead of the normal cramming curve.
 I was glad they weren't waiting until the day before the test to come in for help, but it was looking like tomorrow wasn't going to be any fun.
 Maybe I'd get lucky again, and most of the lazy ones would give up before my shift started.
 I turned around from explaining for the fourth time to the third person why you couldn't prove congruence of two triangles with the nonexistent angle-angle-angle postulate, only to find that Britney had slipped out of the room.

Creation of new types of systems and organizations can create markets and jobs in many ways.
 The Dutch system of flower auction co-operatives is so successful that 68 per cent of the entire world’s exports of cut flowers pass through markets in the Netherlands.
 The franchise system has led to a rapid proliferation of new businesses and new jobs in the West in such widely diverse fields as food services, home remodelling, dry cleaning and real estate.
 Industrial estates, export processing zones, export promotion councils, export insurance, warehouse receipts, quality standards, and thousands of other organizational innovations have been either created or borrowed by developing countries to accelerate social progress.
 A comprehensive study of successful systems and institutions that can be transferred and adapted to local conditions will document the enormous untapped potential for stimulating faster economic and job growth by inventing, imitating and further improving social systems.
 Action Plan to Stimulate Employment in Developing Countries
 Employment generation is a product of multiple factors that combine together.
 Stimulating job creation requires a comprehensive approach, rather than partial policies or piecemeal strategies.
 The achievements of the Newly Industrializing Economies (NIEs) of East Asia demonstrate that tremendous increases in employment generation can be achieved based on comprehensive strategies.
 While broad prescriptions should not be indiscriminately applied to the widely disparate situations confronting different countries, the availability of a number of tested methods under lines the fact that effective and proven policy measures can be formulated to meet the employment needs of every developing country.

I resurfaced as I walked into the tutor lab, unsure if I'd passed anyone I should have greeted.
 I sat down at my usual spot and pulled out a book at random as Britney stomped into the room and threw her books down.
 She was obviously mad, but once again I couldn't muster enough concern to figure out what'd ticked her off.
 I blinked several times as I realized Mrs. Campbell had been speaking to me for several seconds.
 She was important, one of the few teachers that actually liked me.
 It was incredibly hard, but I focused on what she was saying, voluntarily pulling myself partway out of the wonderful cushion and exposing myself to some of the pain.
 "Are you sure you're okay?"
 My nod and smile must not have been very convincing.
 "Listen, there isn't any real reason to keep the lab open so late today, and you've made amazing progress catching up.
 Why don't you take the night off, and go straight home?"

 I mean, I’m all for preachers showing how Biblical advise can help us be nicer, more prosperous, more benevolent, more likely to work toward human rights and all.
 But without the honest search for connection with the Holy Spirit, none of that good advice carries much weight.”
 Eric vs. Max Von Sydow
 Back on the road my thoughts pick up where they left off in San Luis Obispo, and I wonder if Brother Lawrence perceived his constant companion as the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit.
 Maybe my problem with adoring God is my habit of looking at, or for, God the Father, who in my vocabulary is easy to respect, admire, stand in awe of, or even worship, but is hard for me to adore.
 God, to me, looks more like a vapor.
 And his whispering voice either sounds too much like my own to be surely authentic, or else it’s so soft, I’m not often sure I heard right.
 The Jesus I used to picture looked like a young Max Von Sydow in The Greatest Story Ever Told, and his expressions appeared more posed or acted than honestly human.
 But now he's beginning to look more like Eric.

Ok, I wrote “Burn my Bridges” on speed, which is an angry drug, and it’s such an angry song.
 I don’t know, it’s not one of my favorites now, even though it’s newish.
 I wrote it one night—I think Lor and I had had a fight,  a rare fight, and she had gone to a girlfriend’s house and I just thought, fuck it, I’m gonna do speed and stay up all night.
 I didn’t plan on writing.
 I thought, I’ll just speed and watch late night TV—there was some John Agar movie on—You dig John Agar?
 No?
 Don’t know him?
 Anyway, I was sitting there and there was a legal pad on the coffee table because earlier in the day I had tried writing a song about my mother—don’t ask—and it was sitting there like an invitation and I was speeding like a hell-rooster, man, and I just picked up the pad and this big fat marker, I mean I was writing these huge thick letters on the  page (laughs) and I just started, “You were mean to me/Leave me alone, let me sit in my tree/You were a snake, I needed you then/you were like bad heroin.”  And I ripped the whole thing off in about an hour.
 And I recorded it that night in my living room, fingers tearing over my strings till they bled, I was playing so hard, like Richie, and that song, that was recorded in my home—it sounds like it.
 But it was born of anger, and so, well, it’s not one of my faves.

It is hard to sleep on a wild line.
 It is going to be hard to stay here for long.” Doi’van’s deep voice had the tone of making a simple observation, not conversation.
 Rodregas nodded; he had been waiting for the comment, but he had thought it would be Imeralda who brought it up.
 “True,” he said, “unless you have a way of smoothing it out.” Rodregas waited for a few seconds as the three approached the main farmhouse building.
 The walls were of thick cut stone and it was built on an impressive scale for a farmhouse, though worn-looking.
 Of course, there were no signs of a roof, doors or windows.
 As they entered the yard, the feeling of the hair standing up on their bodies settled down and instead a feeling of fullness replaced it.
 The horses had been acting up and Rodregas hoped that with the energy smoothing out, the horses would stop fighting their lines.
 Though in truth the horses seemed to be getting more agitated.
 As the magic smoothed out Rodregas smiled and said, “The ley line would be as much of a problem as a help unless, of course, the farmhouse is made of Nymph stone.” Rodregas expected the sound of pleased surprise but instead heard alarmed in-drawn breaths from them both; he saw that they were looking to the right, where he suddenly noticed movement.

Someone was carrying me.
 The horror must have stretched time, making the few seconds seem like minutes.
 I struggled to bring myself back.
 I could hear nothing but a piercing squall.
 I willed my eyes open, though only a fraction.
 I was looking at the back of a horse from my position slung over someone’s shoulder.
 My eyes closed once more as the pain doubled and I lost my body for a moment.
 I concentrated until I got it back and then realized I was bouncing.
 I worked my eyes again, using every ounce of control I had left.
 I was on a horse, running.

That same racial ability allowed the two brothers to watch the approaching orcs, lean muscle bulging underneath their sweat-glistened pale gray skin.
 Some wore mismatched armor, though most had only skulls, straps of leather, and war paint covering their bodies.
 Wave after wave of arrows rained upon them, and those who fell were trampled by the rest, but the masses were not even slowed.
 Harruq pointed past the army to where a long line of men stood in the distance, carrying no light or torch.
 “What are they doing?” he asked.
 Qurrah searched the line, and he saw what he suspected.
 “The necromancer,” he observed, pointing to the black shape hidden underneath robes and a hood.
 “Those alongside him are dead, Harruq.
 They serve only him.”
 “Huh,” Harruq said.

 Driving through Los Angeles, thinking is dangerous.
 An instant of distraction can get you killed.
 I turn off the I-pod and for some moments attend to driving.
 But I can’t give up remembering Eric, and memories I left behind long ago appear.
 I recall that I wrote my first complete story at Eric’s house.
 We had talked about the future.
 He hadn’t picked a career.
 I wanted to become a writer.
 Eric fetched a pen and paper.

It showed photos of camouflaged pits where guys fell onto sharpened and poisoned poles, and tunnels through which soldiers had to crawl chasing invisible warriors.
 Maybe the thoughts of death by poison or stabs in the dark made my stomach roil.
 Or maybe the cause was the sight of a dancer on the stage beside the bar.
 She was naked except panties sagged around her knees.
 I thought, the babe with auburn hair could be here in her place, if instead of having folks who were churchgoing gringos she had gotten born where I imagined this stoned, lost and weepy dancer had, as the fifteenth child of someone who lived in a hut beside a brown river.
 When a fellow vacated his bar stool, I excused myself from the table and moved there.
 I ordered another shot of tequila, and stared at the mirror behind the liquor shelf, wondering if I looked any different than before I surrendered to Jesus.
 I couldn’t spot a single feature that appeared more saintly or pure.
 I felt no more likely to hand over my jacket to whomever asked, let alone to throw in my shirt.
 The only change I recognized, I felt more confounded than ever.

 I mean, c’mon.
 Have you read “The Waste Land?”  Jesus.
 You know, I love “Day in the Life.”  Shit.
 It doesn’t get much better than that, pop music-wise.

Rodregas and Doi’van circled the chamber.
 Rodregas was not as familiar with the daemons of the Infernal Realms as he was the great beasts of the Celestial Realm.
 He sat looking at a wolf with the tail of a serpent but with large beautiful white wings.
 Then he slowly walked next to a great bull with bat wings and a head that appeared to be very human.
 While he had been drawn to the Chamber both figures repulsed him.
 They mocked the natural order.
 It was  not just that they seemed to combine multiple unconnected animals, but the size and shapes were simply wrong.
 Rodregas looked up from his examination of a strange bull daemon and looked for Doi’van.
 He must have been more familiar with the powers of the various creatures.
 Doi’van had walked past many of the figures until he stood at one toward the back.

A long curled phone cord hung from the center of the ceiling with a roach clip taped to it.
 This was a convenient way to pass a joint around the room without ever leaving your chair.
 The clip swung from smoker to smoker.
 I got up and went to school early the next day, and then my daily routine would repeat itself.
 Somehow I willed myself to stick it out at school despite my surroundings and the influences of my peers.
 I don’t know what it was that enabled me to do this, to not fall entirely into the wasteland of addiction and entitlement.
 Biology?
 Character?
 It’s inexplicable, really.
 All of my roommates had dropped out of high school but somehow I continued; although my grades sucked, they were passing grades.

Only it turned out Rachel and I were the only ones not changing our schedules.
 I started to protest being treated differently than everyone else, only to feel my mouth click shut as Rachel shook her head at me.
 It wasn't until Alec was walking me to Biology that I finally got an explanation.
 "You and Rachel are the ones who need the most sleep, ergo you don't change classes."
 "That's crazy."
 I would've stopped.
 You can't really have a good disagreement while you're walking down the hall, but we happened to be holding hands, which he used to keep me moving along.
 And here I'd been so excited back in the councilor's office when he'd taken my hand.
 "It's not crazy.

I was going to sell them, but if you want to look at them later and see if there are any that might be of use, you can check them out,” Rodregas said.
 “Really, you have books on magic?” she asked with an eager tone.
 "Can you show me now?” Rodregas hesitated; he did not want to show her the books right away.
 Instead, he wanted to see what kind of training Doi’van had.
 But he had never been able to turn down a beautiful woman.
 “Sure,” he said walking back to the barn and the wagon.
 Rodregas jumped on the back, making the wagon squeal in alarm at his weight, and opened ‘his’ trunk and pulled out the last blanket left in it, the one he had wrapped the books up in.
 Rodregas unrolled the blanket on the back of the now mostly empty wagon showing the dozen books that he had saved from Ravenhurr’s library.
 Imeralda reached out for one of the closest, but then stopped as her fingers touched them, as if a spark of lightning had hit her.
 Obviously, she could feel that same power Rodregas had.

 CHAPTER 1 ENDINGS
 “Move along, move along,” Rodregas said.
 He prodded the prisoner up the roughly hewn stone steps none too gently with the butt end of the lit torch in his hand.
 "We don’t have all night."
 The rough handling of the prisoner seemed like a brash act for a man of sixty years, since the young man could have broken him in half with ease if he chose to do so.
 He was powerfully built, and towered head and shoulders over Rodregas.
 In fact the man looked rather like the hero from a bard's tale, with his square jaw and short black curls and fine dark eyes.
 In contrast Rodregas sported a bulging paunch, scrawny legs and loose teeth which gave him fits when he chewed on anything harder than a half-baked wheat cake.
 Rodregas' confidence in the prisoner's lack of retaliation came from the expression of dazed uncertainty on the man's face, a look he recognized on other prisoners whose world came crashing down around them without warning, whose lives changed forever in the blink of an eye.

The dead guard’s small shield, though, was near his feet.
 Rodregas quickly grabbed it as he made some room and switched his short sword to his right and the shield to his left.
 This time they spread out and started to circle.
 Rodregas took a chance before they got too close and glanced over at Doi’van.
 In one of those weird moments that happen in battle, he saw the path between them was open.
 He was also backing up, surrounded by three more foes.
 “At least they are all slavers.” Rodregas thought.
 Rodregas scooted back and said, “Back to back.” Doi’van gave a grunt of acknowledgement, and they faced in opposite directions.
 They were quickly surrounded.
 Another final Immortal Guard stepped into the circle, increasing the odds against them.

I walked and walked and didn't get back.
 All I did was get lost--I couldn't even get back here."
 "You should have woken me up so I could go with you."
 "Then you'd have gone back to 1927 too.
 If I'd succeeded."
 "I could have just followed at a distance.
 Just so I could hear you if you needed me."
 He spooned scrambled eggs onto their plates.
 "It doesn't matter now, anyway."
 She stared at the glass of orange juice he'd set in front of her.

"Alec, she'll probably be okay.
 I know it isn't the best idea but please don't stop her.
 Not tonight."
 It was like I could see the thoughts dart around as he put pieces together, and I was suddenly torn between telling him in the hopes it would buy Jasmin her last night with Ben, and trying to keep her secret.
 My heart raced until he finally relaxed and sank back down with me.
 "Please don't let on that you know.
 I wasn't supposed to say anything.
 I just couldn't let you go after her."
 The immediate crisis past, I could have lost myself looking at his features, but a slow smile suddenly reminded me of the only other person I knew that could pack so much pain in such a simple gesture.
 "What about Rachel, Alec?

That is impossible!” “Can we wait one moment?” asked Imeralda raising her hand.
 “I think we need to bring Doi’van in to be part of this conversation.” Rodregas just nodded, stunned at the news.
 As Imeralda left the room to get Doi’van, Jordaan stepped closer and slowly moved his hand from Rodregas’ feet to his head, his eyes half closed.
 Rodregas wondered what he could sense.
 “You are a Nymph of the flesh?” Rodregas asked him.
 Contrary to his early good mood, the Nymph froze at those words.
 With a hesitant smile the green haired Nymph said, “We actually prefer the term Nymph of Life.
 Truly, life is as powerful an element as any.” “Sorry,” Rodregas said, realizing he had accidentally insulted the healer, “I have never spent much time with Nymphs.” Rodregas’ tone was quieter.
 The Nymph seemed young and smart and gifted.
 Rodregas knew he did not have to like him.

Who were we going to tell?
 About a month after this robbery, I looked out the window of our apartment and to my surprise saw the guy who had set us up for the robbery!
 He was a tall lanky guy with a bushel of hair so he was easy to spot.
 I dragged Pete to the window to show him the guy.
 We hustled down the stairs and I walked straight towards this guy and he didn’t recognize me at all.
 He asked me if I wanted to buy some pot in exactly the same way he did before.
 I said, “Sure, should we follow you to the same apartment so your friends can rob us again?” He looked shocked and before he could say a word, I dropped him with one punch where he stood and it didn’t stop there.
 This guy was begging for his life as I pummeled him and Pete just watched in shock.
 I made this scumbag give me every penny he had on him and we never saw him again.
 One day as we walked away from a beach after swimming, a police car pulled over and started to question us.

It is neither equitable nor justifiable.
 Already, 156 countries have signed the treaty, owing either to coercion or indifference, and the number is expected to increase to 170 out of 179 states by 1995.
 The acceptance of non-proliferation by these countries further delegitimizes the continued possession of nuclear weapons by any country.
 All of the treaty non-signatories can be persuaded to sign in exchange for annihilation of these weapons by those that now possess them.
 Under these circumstances, refusal to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty could be considered sufficient grounds for expulsion from UN membership.
 Without a universal ban, the efforts of the nuclear powers to stop proliferation lack moral authority.
 Arguments are often advanced that nuclear weapons cannot be ‘dis-invented’, and that the danger of a rogue state or terrorist group acquiring and threatening use of these weapons necessitates that the present nuclear powers retain them for such a contingency.
 With the massive conventional firepower already available, nuclear weapons are not needed for defence, even against a rogue state with nuclear capability, and they do not represent a credible defence against terrorism under any circumstances.
 How could nuclear weapons conceivably be used to retaliate against terrorism?
 Alternative solutions can be found to address these threats far more effectively.

 Rachel's eyes lit up brighter than I'd seen them in a while.
 "You're welcome.
 Does that mean we can go to Vegas?"
 It seemed like a crime to deny her, but I knew Mom didn't have the spare money to send me on a two-hour trip to an opera.
 I was working now, but by the time I could save up enough to pay for gas, food, and a ticket, the production would've moved on.
 "I'm sorry, I'd like to go, but I just don't think I can.
 If it was running for an extra month or two I could probably save up enough money from tutoring, but it isn't, so it just isn't going to happen."

No such determinism exists, except in our minds.
 Given the right leadership, we can change the course, amend the rules, alter the structures and accelerate action to achieve an entirely different and more favourable set of outcomes.
 Our future is not a question of fate.
 It is a question of choice.
 Evolutionary Opportunities
 What then is the justification for predicting a bright future?
 There are political, economic, social and technological forces active in the world today that can override the causality of past trends and combine together to make this a time of unprecedented opportunity.

His armor had kept it from penetrating too deeply, the barbs unable to latch onto any soft flesh.
 Of course it still hurt like the abyss, but he could deal with that.
 What he could not deal with, however, was how few in number his soldiers had become.
 More than four of his own men lay dead around him, joined by three dead elves, five if he counted the two the half-orc had thrown through the doorway.
 A good ratio considering the skill of the elves, but not good enough.
 Men he had trained were dying, and for what?
 “I have honored your will, my lord,” he said.
 “But it is time I honor my men.”
 From his belt, he took a white horn bearing the symbol of Neldar.
 He put this ancient horn to his lips and blew.

The military in many developing countries possesses the organizational capabilities and experience with intensive training to assist with this task.
 An institutional gap exists in agricultural training systems.
 In most developing countries, agricultural colleges, universities and polytechnics train researchers, government, bank employees and extension officers, but not farmers.
 Producing more food with less water, less chemicals and less soil erosion requires high levels of skill.
 The chain of agricultural training needs to be filled out at the lower level by establishing thousands of village-level farm schools as proposed in the chapter on food security.
 The switch from centrally planned to market-oriented economic systems in Eastern Europe cannot be successful until the population has acquired the skills needed to function effectively in the new economic environment.
 Under the communist system, emphasis was placed on education and training in technical subjects with little attention to marketing, organizational, commercial and interpersonal skills, which are essential requirements for functioning in a market economy.
 A detailed inventory should be compiled of the types and levels of skills needed for transition to the market, covering areas such as entrepreneurship, management, national and international marketing, strategic business planning, finance, quality control, product development, production technology, design, and human resource development.
 Intensive training programmes need to be introduced to impart these skills on a massive scale.
 Even in the most advanced industrial nations there is vast scope for upgrading skills to improve productivity and to keep pace with rapid technological development.

There was the gratitude.
 Misplaced on her perfect face.
 Wrong on the features of someone who couldn't possibly need help from a mere mortal, but still there.
 "It's so beautiful.
 I don't know what to say.
 Are you sure you want to give it up?"
 Alec looked back up at me, and his eyes were filled with incredible need.
 I was suddenly struck by the similarities to the me he'd painted, and what I saw written on his face.
 It seemed impossible he would be unsure, that a glorious being like him could ever need anything I could provide, but I couldn't deny it was there.
 There was no way of knowing what it was, but I didn't care.

When they played poker, stacks of hundred dollar bills spilled across the table, and one of the requirements to sit at the table was to put your gun in a pile of weapons across the room.
 I guess they didn’t want the loser to play his trump card with a pistol!
 My brother and I hustled drinks for them for small tips.
 After we were told to go to bed, we would hide behind the counter that blocked the table where they played cards.
 We could stay there late into the night and hear details of these shady lives.
 They all had odd nicknames.
 One man was called “The Painter” and I have no idea where the name came from but I did know that if they needed someone’s house “painted” that this man was going there to kill them.
 He was a hit man, plain and simple!
 Their conversations were graphic.
 One night my stepfather won a big poker hand that included a man’s car, a classic Bentley!

 “But imagine my surprise when he walked out of the trees, following a green-eyed beauty.” Steed smiled at the memory and then turned serious.
 “When I ran into the… trackers, I had hope Ruby had told the truth and might know where to find you.” He laughed.
 “She tried to hide you, but I recognized the horses out front.” “She tried to hide us?” “Ah, yes.

 Always meddling in the affairs of others, causing trouble whenever possible.

 She could have him, but only if she stayed here.
 And she couldn't do that.
 She had to go home.

I had thought they’d departed suddenly, but I was confident then that it was not of their choosing.
 I went back outside and examined the tracks again.
 I followed the imp’s this time and found my answer.
 Outside of the camp, I uncovered blood and drag marks.
 The imp had killed what appeared to be three of the camp’s inhabitants and dragged them off, likely by stringer and tow.
 Whatever was there had run away because of the attack, and recently.
 I questioned my sister again—she’d had some time to cool down—but she was no help.
 I immediately knew she had not even considered that whatever she had been so interested in was still out here, probably close.
 I didn’t clue her in.
 After a little more time there, I acted as if I’d lost interest and headed home.

 They stopped twice for Qurrah to catch his breath.
 His weak body gasped for air, sweat lining his face and neck.
 In the starlight, he looked so pale, so frail, that Harruq wondered how his brother could be so fearsome in combat.

We hadn't gone more than a step or two before his grip on my arm grew painful.

 "Sorry, I just don't like to see that kind of needless destruction.
 It makes everyone look bad and costs the town a lot of money."
 Brandon's smile was back, but it didn't have his trademark easy carelessness.

 "Guys!

I knew exactly where this was going.
 Actually, I was kind of relieved she wasn't going to be around this afternoon.
 Birthdays are supposed to be special.
 Dad had always understood that and done an amazing job of surprising us with something new and unusual on our birthdays.
 Mom had always felt like a round of happy birthdays and a cake more than met the requirements for birthday specialness.
 It was going to be hard enough missing Dad on the one day guaranteed to make me think of him.
 It would've been worse if Mom was around constantly making comparisons between what she was doing and what Dad would've done.
 "...so this is the only day he can help me, and if I don't get some help climbing, then I'll never make it high enough to get the shot for the tourism booklet.

 I didn't know it was possible to blush and smile at the same time.
 "Nope, not sick."
 After such a beginning, my day could hardly be anything but great.
 One class after another rolled by, and all of the things that normally would've bothered me just went whipping past without managing to stick.
 I couldn't remember the second phase of cell division in Biology.
 I'd forgotten to reread the last chapter of Wuthering Heights, and Britney went out of her way to snub me.
 The only thing I cared about was making it to lunch so I could see Brandon again.
 I dawdled on my way to Algebra, so much so I was nearly late for class.
 It wasn't until I sat down at my desk and felt a wave of disappointment slither through me that I realized I'd been hoping to see Brandon in between classes.

 “Wherever you two go, I will follow,” he answered.
 “Settled then,” Aurelia said.
 “You two are going to have to play along when we get there, though.” She glanced at the sky, which was still speckled with stars even though dawn fast approached.
 “We’ll wait until morning.
 I could use a bit more sleep.”
 She walked away, cast a levitation spell upon herself, and then settled in for sleep hovering an inch above the grass.
 “Odd girl,” Qurrah whispered.
 Harruq forced a laugh.
 To Qurrah’s eyes, he looked exhausted, and the shrinking of his muscles was glaring.

The nicest tools were in a cabinet, and with a grunt (it was heavy even for him) he picked it up and loaded it into the cart, along with some other useful implements.
 He would need to carry as much food as possible as well.
 He quickly went back into the main keep and wrapped up the mattress from Captain Poir’s bunk and started carrying barrels of flour and other foodstuffs to his pile next to the front entrance.
 The drudge stared at him with a strange look but did not question his actions.
 He then realized that he should go up and check out the laboratory for anything else of value, and check out the dungeon to make sure all the prisoners had been freed.
 He had brought a proper crow bar from his visit to the smith’s and made short work of the laboratory door.
 The room had several large circles in the floor and tables and shelves along the side.
 The shelves held bones and bowls of strange fluids and other items whose uses he could not imagine.
 Anything that felt foul he threw into the fireplace, after getting a good flame going.
 Several books and strange containers ended up in the fire, though he did find two books that felt of magic that he kept.

 Several of the squires were being seen to by attendants making sure everything was secure, and waiting for the start of the match.
 Rodregas thought he was alone until he heard Imeralda speak from behind him, “Did you see who is watching from the Great Hall’s door?” she asked.
 Rodregas glanced over, it was Van’dret.
 He stood tall and handsome, young squires surrounding him ready to serve.
 Rodregas thought that the Immortalist was watching him.
 He would have to leave quickly after the tournament, as the man was growing suspicious of them.
 Rodregas would have loved to kill him, but Van’dret was a powerful sorcerer capable of magic that made him nearly impossible to kill.
 “Do you remember The Lion?” asked Imeralda.
 “What?” Rodregas asked.

He pulled his brother down the alley to where a tall, crumbled house leaned near the wall.
 “Onto my shoulders,” Harruq suggested, grabbing Qurrah’s knees and hoisting him high.
 Qurrah latched onto the roof, paused, and then stepped onto Harruq’s shoulders.
 The extra height boosted his head and chest above the roof, allowing him to climb to the top despite a moment of flailing.
 Harruq clapped for him, and he smiled at the next roar from the orcs.
 It was a goofy smile, and Qurrah recognized the fear hiding behind it.
 “Hurry,” Qurrah said as Harruq climbed, using a windowsill as a foothold.
 Together, they stood upon the roof and gazed over the wall, mesmerized by the sight before them.
 Mere seconds away, hundreds and hundreds of orcs charged.
 Their race could see as well in night as in day.

You’re the connection between Igneeria and your world.
 He needs you and he has made that clear.” The world had fallen to silence.
 I spoke in barely a whisper, “Igneeria, that’s your world isn’t it?
 What does Kojas want?” The dwarf seemed to be getting extremely excited now, “He wants your world and all other worlds because he is a mighty king who wishes to expand his kingdom.” “So how would we help him do that?” I asked, stalling.
 “We just exterminate the pests.” “You’re a half-ling!
 You’re the bridge to our world.
 Now if you don’t mind we would like to finish you now, and bring you to the King.” The dwarf said politely and snickered, approaching me.
 I backed up slowly.
 “Uh, I mind a lot actually.” I said quickly but I guess they didn’t really want my opinion.
 Emily jumped out from behind the trees and lifted a flame.

They were fed incredible grilled silver salmon, greens from the Northern Kingdoms, and small pastries from the Korin Islands.
 Taiga seemed in no hurry to get to any point, Immortalist had nothing, if not time.
 Finally, Taiga brought up the point that Van’dret believed had gained him the honor of joining Taiga in his solar.
 “So I understand that you are to journey to the Cathedral of the Heavens for this year’s open tourney?” Taiga asked his voice as melodic as one would expect from an elf, but just a tad deeper than one would think.
 “Yes, my lord, I leave in the morning,” Van’dret replied.
 “Excellent, you will have to keep your eyes open for potential talent worthy of the Immortal Guard,” Taiga stated.
 Van’dret nodded, that was one of his main responsibilities, but it could not be why he had been invited up to Taiga’s solar.
 “I would encourage you to be careful on your trip over.
 You did hear about what happened to Ravenhurr?” asked Taiga.
 Van’dret almost felt his eye brows rise, “of course, but what should I watch out for?

 Art – Why haven’t you been helping out?
 Jim – Um, because there were already a bunch of people.

 Do I have a need to get my thoughts out, to let the public in on my life, my style, my method, my oeuvre?
 Nah.

 Dylan asking, “How does it feel to be on your own like a complete unknown?” and I kept thinking about that and I was one gone gommie.
 I was feckless.

She'd always been nice to Davis, but she'd never treated him like a son.
 But she'd love Rick.
 Rick was so warm and funny, and her mother would feel comfortable with him.
 She stopped, squeezing her eyes shut.
 She couldn't stop thinking about him.
 Even when she thought about her family, Rick somehow surfaced in her mind.
 Rick glanced at his watch.
 She'd been in the garden for 20 minutes.
 It was foggier than usual--was that an indication that there'd be a door or window or whatever back to 1927?
 Now that he'd told her he loved her, had opened his heart to her completely, he couldn't bear the thought that she might not walk back into his arms.

And they were worried about my stupid binding?
 The circling cloaks from my dreams were back, filling my head.
 My thoughts were twisting, getting out of control.
 They’d be hunting us all down now.
 They would kill us.
 That was why I needed training.
 To protect myself.
 Because they intended to kill me, not capture.
 They intended to kill us all.
 And without magic, bound as I was, I didn’t stand a chance.

He fell to his knees and stabbed the old weapons into the dirt.
 The faces of those he had killed danced before his eyes, especially the mother and her child, and the young girl holding her little sister.
 The fear in their eyes.
 The screams.
 The panic.
 Horror.
 “I do what I have to do,” he said again.
 But did the villagers have to die?
 All those children, mothers, sisters, fathers…‌nothing but a test.
 And all those small bodies he left for his brother to mutilate?

 "You've never actually been on a school bus before, have you?"

 I found myself returning her smile.
 You really couldn't spend any time around Rachel and not find yourself smiling.

As it was, I blindly followed Ruby as we gathered and eventually mounted to leave.
 Chevelle, Steed, and I were back on our mounts from the earlier leg of the journey.
 Ruby, Grey, and Anvil each rode their own black horses, though Anvil’s was larger—I assumed to accommodate his massive frame—and Ruby’s was decorated, tendrils of red and gold in his mane.
 Though it wasn’t unusual, I didn’t see Rhys and Rider or the wolves.
 I wondered if they had their own horses and preferred to stay out of sight or if they ran with the wolves.
 I felt slightly comforted either way.
 Once we were on our way, I didn’t mind so much.
 I was enjoying being back in the rhythm of the ride, not to mention the break from training.
 Conversation flowed easily as we made our way farther up the mountain.
 I had been thinking about my discussion with Steed, but hadn’t decided how to respond if I were asked again about the incident in the clearing, about controlling the snake.

I was still chilled enough from being outside for the warmth of his arms to feel good.
 "Adjam and Inock found that the dayborn had lost all knowledge of their loving mother, and that they reacted poorly to Inock's plague form.
 Neither brother was able to maintain their original forms for more than a few hours at a time, and although Adjam was able to blend in with the animals found in the area, there was nothing like Inock's feline body nearby, and he was chased and hunted by many of the dayborn, for they thought him a demon."
 Alec's breath caressed the back of my neck even as his quiet, velvety baritone reached inside my head and smoothed away the tensions that'd been keeping me from seeking sleep.
 I knew there'd been a reason for being so scared, but I just couldn't bring myself to care about it now.
 "The brothers watched the dayborn for many turnings, but although they learned many things, they found themselves unable to learn the dayborns' language.
 Even worse, the dayborn hunters were becoming ever more skilled at tracking Inock, and they began to press him sorely."
 I felt as though I was drifting.
 The bed no longer mattered, or even seemed to exist.
 All that mattered was the story and the warm drowsiness that increased with each breath.

 So this was the night!
 Wanting to prolong the moment as long as possible, she asked him, "What is it?"
 "Open it and see."
 She took it, glancing at his face as she raised the lid.
 The sapphire immediately caught the light, and she gasped.
 "This is beautiful!"
 He reached out to take her hand.
 "Marie, will you marry me?"
 She gazed at him for a moment before crying, "Yes!"

 “Strange?” she asked.

 He chuckled.
 “It may sound odd, but I can see his eyes.

 He dresses himself in the black robes of a priest, and I cannot find his tracks come the morning.
 That doesn’t happen, Aurelia.

That's the one thing guaranteed to make him go through with his threats.
 You'll just have to be satisfied with the fact that you'll both continue to be able to live in our fine city."
 Normally I would have just acquiesced, but I couldn't bear the thought of letting him leave, taking with him the identity of the only person besides my mom who really cared what happened to me.
 I tightened my grip in an attempt to stop him.
 "Please, if you won't tell me who it is, let me write a thank you note.
 I have to do something.
 He's done so much for us."
 He stopped partway through shaking his head.
 "I can't promise he'll even bother to read it, but I'll take it to him if you promise never to talk about this again.
 I don't want to hear even the slightest rumor anything unusual happened in association with this project."

Especially considering how slowly each individual day had dragged along.
 Most of my waking hours had been spent wondering if Saturday night was ever going to arrive.
 My train of thought shattered as I got my first glimpse of the interior of what'd become my own personal Mecca.
 The exterior of the building had been impressive, complete with statues and sculptures reminiscent of an eighteenth-century opera house, but I hadn't expected the illusion to hold once I passed through the enormous, gilded doors.
 I'd been wrong.
 The floors were a gorgeous marble which drew the eyes to the nearest golden-white wall, and up the elaborate gilded trim towards vaulted ceilings.
 It was like walking into a palace, complete with painted, spun-sugar clouds, and burgundy drapes made out of rich velvet.
 If it wasn't for the press of people pushing me from behind, I probably would've stayed in the front entryway right up until the sound of the orchestra filtered down to me.
 As it was, I only got a few hurried looks before being rushed along with the rest of the students.
 Seeing all of my classmates looking utterly bored as they allowed themselves to be herded through the most amazing building I'd ever seen brought me back to my original train of thought.

The media can play an invaluable role in disseminating relevant information to the public, but the type and quality of information being carried in most developing countries must be radically improved.
 The worldwide tendency to focus on the immediate and dramatic at the expense of that which could make a substantial and lasting contribution to development requires greater efforts to creatively present socially useful information in an easily accessible and interesting form.
 Information in developing countries
 In the industrial democracies there are usually multiple sources of independent information available to the public on most issues.
 The same is not the case in developing countries, where very often the sole source of information is government – which lacks credibility because the quality of information is poor or it is politically motivated – or academic institutions that are insulated from practical, especially commercial, realities.
 The need is especially great for broadcasting value-added information at the local level.
 Specialized agencies should be established in developing countries in the form of public foundations or independent research institutions to provide a credible, unbiased source of information by identifying critical gaps in public awareness needed to stimulate development in various fields; conducting studies to document proven practices in agriculture, business, education, health, government, media; disseminating information on new opportunities; commissioning films, novels, short stories and syndicated columns to communicate developmental information; supporting pioneering examples of new or improved activities in different fields; encouraging others to imitate successful pioneers; recognizing and rewarding high achievers.
 A modest investment in new institutions to disseminate information can have an impact comparable to that of the information superhighways being heralded in the most industrially advanced nations – accelerating adoption of new activities, magnifying response to government programmes, and doubling the total developmental achievements of a country over the next five years.
 Information as a stimulus to transition
 The people of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are highly educated, but long deprived of free access to information.

 Batman is a weakling in a stupid costume with some gizmos, without his gizmos he’s just a loser in tights.

 They’re all he needs.

 On top of that the Sumo-mobile can outrun the Bat-mobile any day of the week, not to mention the fact that its solar powered so its earth friendly.

We met at a small church charismatic enough so that nobody minded when she stood in the midst of a service and offered her latest poem.
 Long ago, Olga had discovered that what she needed most was God.
 She would hike and pray her way up Cowles Mountain, a mile and a half of rocky trail, then call her best friend Warren so they could pray together, sometimes for hours.
 Then she might go to work, cleaning somebody’s home while listening to worship music.
 God, God, God.
 Here is another of her poems, a simple one I’m choosing because you can also find it on Youtube, read by my Zoë: Jesus, in the night you are my nightlight.
 Jesus, in the morning you are my daylight.
 Jesus, in the afternoon you are my sunlight.
 Jesus, in the evening you are my starlight.
 But Jesus in the night you are my nightlight.

 It took several minutes to gather my thoughts enough to know where I was.

 I was drenched in sweat.
 My head throbbed.
 Something had happened to me.

“ _Verl Yun Kleis,_ ” he hissed.
 _Hands of ice_.
 The half-orc lunged forward, grabbing the old man by the wrist.
 Blue light swirled around the contact of their flesh, causing the water and blood inside his arm to freeze.
 Qurrah’s smile broadened as the man collapsed and died while still within his grasp.
 When he let go, the icy flesh hit the dirt hard enough to crack the arm at the shoulder.
 Blood poured out from the body but not the arm.
 “A marvelous spell,” the half-orc gasped, fighting away a momentary wave of dizziness.
 He closed his eyes and attuned his mind to the village.
 A stench of fear trailed west.

 “Getting better,” the half-orc said.
 “You’re going to be beating my ass in a few weeks if you keep learning as fast as you are.”
 “Don’t worry,” she said, patting his hand.
 “Your ass is safe with me.”
 Harruq laughed at the absurdity.
 Aurelia, meanwhile, absently drew lines in the dirt.

It was virtually guaranteed we wouldn't learn anything which was fortunate or I might have missed something.
 Once my mind latched on the question of what had been different than normal, I didn't hear a word anyone else said.
 It wasn't until I was back at my locker and midway between switching out my History book for my Physics notes that I finally realized what it was.
 Normal juniors didn't sit at a lunch table and figure out what to do about anything.
 They complained, they gossiped, they boasted about what they were going to do, but it was all just an exercise designed to reinforce the social order.
 I'd seen it played out in multiple grades, among groups ranging from the jocks down to the lunatic fringe, and while the details changed, the overall form didn't.
 It was a universal constant, like the speed of light or maybe gravity.
 Only Brandon's group hadn't been gossiping.
 They'd been discussing, brainstorming even.
 I didn't know what it meant.

But I quickly recalled the incident at the library and turned, heading toward home.
 Until I remembered my run-in with Fannie.
 I had nowhere to go.
 A pain throbbed deep in my chest.
 Instinct pushing me, I ran for the clearing where I’d learned with Chevelle.
 He was there, waiting for me.
 The pain in my chest dulled a little.
 Or maybe it was only overwhelmed by a new pressure.
 I crossed to him slowly.
 Junnie was all I’d had since I came here and now she was gone.

You know I heal more quickly than you do."
 An upraised finger cut me off before I could latch onto my last remaining point.
 "The fact that your injury was less severe is really quite immaterial.
 Even the fact that shape shifter-inflicted wounds don't heal as quickly as normal for me is really a small matter when compared to just how much blood you lost before we got the bleeding staunched."
 And there was the real rub.
 Alec was well on his way to being fully healed, while I still had fits of dizziness every time I tried to stand.
 I even had to have Jasmin or Dom help me to the bathroom.
 There was no good way to know how long I'd lain there with a branch stuck through my back, but it'd been long enough for even a relatively small wound to result in near fatal blood loss.
 I'd been nearly unconscious from the pain, so I didn't remember any of what had happened next, but Alec had reluctantly filled in most of the details.
 Apparently the stress of the fight had finally awakened his potential, and his power was a real humdinger.

The rocks streaked past us as we ran faster and faster, the wind whipping his mane.
 A great bird perched on the dead limb of an ironwood tree and I jumped to it just as it dropped from the branch and flared its wings out to catch the wind.
 We flew still farther as I watched the mountain pass below.
 There was a scrubby patch of trees ahead and I could see movement there, inside.
 I tried to focus on it… familiar silver and white.
 Commotion brought me back and I sat up, startled.
 My head spun.
 Ruby caught my arm to steady me.
 Her smile was strained as she handed me a drink of water.
 Chevelle was near the entrance of the stone room with Anvil and Grey.

 "When you get back, what are you going to talk to her about?"

 Fresh tears ran down her cheeks.
 He tilted her chin up, wiping away her tears.
 "Won't you consider staying here with me?
 Marrying me?"
 Her throat tightened, and she pulled her chin free, shaking her head.

Who knew what Alec thought.
 He'd obviously fled his own room to avoid talking to me when I finally woke up.
 Donovan's gentle knock and appearance at the door pulled me up short before I could really get going on the self-loathing.
 "Good morning Mistress Paige, I hope you slept well."
 He limped into the room with his odd, somehow graceful lurch, and then set down a tray filled with eggs, French toast, orange juice and everything else you'd expect if you were to go to IHOP and order their 'everything but the kitchen sink' special.
 While I was still trying to catalog everything on the tray, Donovan laid out a full set of clothes, everything either in unopened manufacturer's plastic bags, or with price tags still attached.
 "Mistress Rachel thought you might desire a change of clothes seeing as how Master Alec carried you off without providing proper time for you to pack your things.
 I pray though that you not think too harshly of him.
 It was he who prepared your breakfast.
 A small act of atonement, but still a start nonetheless."

And, music, well, he just drips music.
 It comes out of his fingertips like liquid electricity, I’ve never played with anyone better.
 It’s all so effortless for him.
 And he lives it, music and spirituality, what we’re all really looking for, what we all really want our lives to be.
 He’s really a template for the rest of us.
 Anyone starting out, you could do a lot worse than following what he does.
 And I think we’re only seeing the tip of the iceberg with him.
 I think Santana may change the way we listen to music.
 If I had to pick two groups to watch in the 70s, two that are gonna set the pace for the rest of us, it would be Carlos and the boys, and The Band.
 The Band—I don’t know them very well, Bob introduced us once, but they were kind of into their own thing and didn’t really hang with us, you know?

There was a stone-framed bed wide enough for two, dark olive blankets in layers on top.
 A side table held a few trinkets and a decanter set, and there was a hickorywood wardrobe in the corner.
 A full mirror lined the east wall.
 I took a few steps forward, staring in disbelief as my figure came into view.
 I had seen the reflection in the water, had known my hair was dark, my eyes a strange shade of green.
 But as I gazed at the woman in my reflection, I could not reconcile the two.
 The dark silhouette, her figure emphasized by fitted clothes, black cape draped behind her—this woman was breathtaking.
 I moved closer to examine her, nearly reaching out to touch the windblown sable hair.
 Her eyes—my eyes—were dark.
 That muddy fog was gone now and under my black lashes waited deep emerald jewels, flecked with the darkest of browns.

I could see its haunches tense up, and then it was airborne, hurtling towards me almost faster than I could follow.
 Only it didn't hit me.
 A patch of night had interposed itself between me and the wolf.
 My vision still wasn't up to making out fine details, and everything was moving too quickly to follow.
 The growling seemed to be in three parts now, which didn't make any sense because the patch of night was vaguely man-shaped, if impossibly big.
 There was a yelp as one of the wolves was tossed into the side of the canyon with enough force that I could feel it from where I was lying.
 A shower of sparks lit up the night as the second wolf dodged away from my defender, and then impossibly the first wolf was back and darting in as I heard jaws snap shut on something.
 The black shadow staggered back, nearly falling under the combined weight of its two opponents.
 A second later another yelp was cut short as one of the wolves fell away to lie motionless on the ground.
 My head was throbbing so bad I blacked out for a moment, and missed the end of the fight.

A few seconds later we were outside, traveling through the darkness with a breakneck speed that would've been suicidal with merely human vision.
 I was completely lost by the time we came around a corner and my inferior eyes were finally able to see the first hints of light up ahead.
 Alec slowed, to prolong the suspense as we got closer.
 Even so, it was only a few more steps before the grotto materialized out of the darkness before us.
 I'd thought it'd been breathtaking two weeks ago bathed in the light of the full moon.
 I'd been amazed at its lush beauty the couple of times I'd snuck back during the daylight.
 Neither of those compared to what greeted me now.
 Soft light came from dozens of floating lamps that'd been placed in the pool, all of which gave off an aching, white luminescence that seemed perfectly matched to the brilliant white of the rose petals scattered over the surface of the water.
 It wasn't until we got closer that I could make out the purple edging to the petals.
 "Lagrimas."

This room, like the Celestial Chamber, seems to have similar beasts of the Infernal realm.
 Rodregas was also drawn to a lesser extent, which might indicate that we were right about Ravenhurr experimenting with Infernal power.
 If Ravenhurr had already included its magic in his own, then Rodregas would have it now.
 Imeralda though has no connection to the Infernal Realms and therefore is blind to it.” The three nodded slowly, caught up in the mystery of the hidden chambers.
 Imeralda said, “The need for a connection to sense the rooms would be true for the knights as well.
 We know that neither Hellborn nor Nymphs are usually allowed in.
 In that case there might actually be another room behind the forth wall that we simply don’t have a connection to and therefore cannot sense.” The others nodded.
 Rodregas thought that they were heading along the right path.
 Imeralda asked, “Does that mean that in this room these are great sigils as well?
 Ones that require Infernal sourced magic to work?

Chevelle rolled his eyes.
 Still smiling, I looked back to the stone, but it had returned to its uninteresting round shape.
 Chevelle answered my unspoken question.
 “Yes, it’s… tricky.” He smiled a little at using Steed’s word.
 “You can’t change something’s makeup, but you can change the way it appears.
 You can move it, but only if you’re near.
 You can stop someone’s heart, but you can’t make them feel happy about it.” He hesitated after that last part, contemplating, and then continued, “You can manipulate the elements, move water, draw it from the ground, but you cannot easily make it appear from nothing… though one can usually collect moisture from the air.
 Fire is easier.
 It spreads so fast.
 You can pull a small spark from anywhere to create a flame, fueled by the air and…” He trailed off as I leaned closer to him, listening intently.

Somewhere around this time, I decided to try and find my biological father, Richard, a natural thing for a young man my age to want to do, right?
 So I tracked him down and called him.
 Richard was living in Arkansas and had been for many years.
 We talked on the phone and upon discovering he would be near our homes on a business trip, arranged a meeting at a hotel—with Thomas too.
 Thomas begged out at the last minute, and without contacting Richard I brought my friend Bill with me for the drive into the bay area.
 When I knocked on the door of the hotel room, my father opened the door looked at me, called me Thomas, and then he looked at Bill and called him by my name.
 He didn’t even know what his own kids looked like.
 We spent a brief time in the hotel room getting our names and heritage correct then we were off to dinner.
 During the dinner, Richard asked if I could “score some toot” which I discovered meant find cocaine.
 Well, I didn’t need to look much past my pocket to score, so we ended up getting drunk and snorting toot to commemorate our father and son reunion.

But she was going to marry Davis--she couldn't kiss another man!
 "Are you hungry, honey?"
 Rick asked when "I Love Lucy" went off.
 "No.
 But I-I don't feel like watching TV any more right now.
 Could we do something else?
 Will you show me how to use the washing machine?"
 After they'd put in a load of clothes, they had some ice cream and then returned to the living room to read.
 Rick had gotten her the Dragonriders of Pern series, since those books were about a world that was new to all readers and had very few offensive elements.
 She'd wanted some romances, but he was afraid that they'd be too explicit for her.

“She’s a hoot!” Chevelle looked as though he could be in danger of losing his temper.
 I didn’t get the joke.
 “You’re serious?” Steed said, humor vanished as he gaped at Chevelle.
 “What, she’s a bright lighter?” Chevelle was across the gap and in his face almost before Steed could stand.
 I jerked back in response, but a screeching siren pierced my ears and I doubled over, covering them.
 It was inside, a screaming, terrible howl coming from my ears.
 I tried to force my eyes open, hoping someone would help me, but they were just standing there, chest to chest, arguing.
 Did they not see me?
 I ached to scream for help, but couldn’t get a sound out, couldn’t breathe.
 They leaned toward each other, oblivious to anything else.

 Then he heard talking and shut his mouth.
 “Are you alright, Dieredon?” an elf asked.
 The scoutmaster nodded, leaning heavily on his bow.
 “I will be fine.
 His magic left my body upon his death.”
 A neigh brought his attention upward.
 Sonowin landed next to him, her white hair stained red in places.
 She nuzzled the elf and snorted something.

The announcer, heard by all who attended this rural school in the center of Hoisington, Kansas, called my father’s name, Richard T. DeHaven, and then my mother’s newly acquired married name, Karla June DeHaven.
 It echoed through the classrooms, with a collective gasp from students and teachers.
 They were excused from class, walked through the desks that lined the classroom, all eyes following them out the door.
 Their parents stood with the principal ready for their arrival at the office.
 As they entered the room it wasn’t hard to see the anger and disappointment.
 They were from different sides of this small town.
 My father’s dad was a butcher, his wife a seamstress.
 My mother’s dad was an oil rig grunt of American-Indian decent, and his wife, a meek submissive homemaker.
 Neither parent thought the other was good enough for their child, let alone the fact that they were both still children.
 Once the reason for the marriage was revealed, their parents accepted it as best as they could.

I picked him up hitchhiking.
 He settled into the seat, set his Bible on his lap, stared at me for a minute and asked, “Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?” “Yep,” I said, and readied myself to field the standard subsequent questions.
 Tony said, “Oh.
 Good.” A week later, he was leading a Bible study at our house.
 Cliff’s not much of a talker.
 I believe nobody heard his stories from Vietnam until years afterward.
 I don’t pry, so I can’t be sure what goes on inside him, but I have no reason to think he believes in God, or that he doesn’t.
 But whether he believes or not, Cliff has gotten well blessed since our evening with Billy Graham.
 He has four wonderful kids, and Toni, who is one of those rarest of people who appear to grow brighter, stronger, and more beautiful every year.
 Cliff and Billy's dad, Cliff Senior, invited me to dinner not many years ago.

 I just know now that I can't trust you with those kinds of things."
 Mrs. Campbell's class served as another safe haven.
 There were still plenty of looks, but nobody dared gossip, and Britney was safely seated on the other side of the room.
 I took a little bit of sick satisfaction over the fact that everyone else was frantic about our test tomorrow.
 I actually couldn't have been happier.
 This was the first section where I'd been in a position to sit for the exam with everyone else.
 Our lecture essentially consisted of an extended review, which I quickly realized I didn't need.
 I broke out my book and started in on one of my catch-up assignments instead.
 At the rate I was going I'd be able to take my makeup exam way ahead of schedule.

Out of fear.
 On account of worries about my kids.
 Out of gratitude.
 I didn’t tell Toni about Eric or Chicago and the Polish fellow I could easily have murdered, or about blaming myself for the heart attack that set up my dad for the big one.
 "One time," I said, "I was suffering panic attacks.
 I guess that time, it was the comfort motive.” “Did it work?” she asked.
 “Sure, gradually.
 And then, another time, when I decided to actually find a church I would go to more than once or twice, was on account of feeling quite blessed and knowing I ought to be spending more time thanking God than I ever would on my own.” “How did you know which church to pick?” Such a question calls for more coffee.
 I pour a cup and say, “Well, the evangelical ones were where I found more people who actually tried to get closer to God.
 You know, to better understand God through all kinds of means.

 He gazed into her eyes.

 "I know that.

University of Arizona, whom I count as my team since I taught there for several years, is leading University of Hawaii when we leave, on account of a book signing.
 My friend Alan, with whom I’ve partnered for a lot of book signings, likes to hound me about a remark I once made, “There’s no such thing as a bad signing.” Well, by now I’ll admit that there is such a thing.
 But most often, even if you don’t sell many books, interesting stuff happens.
 And you never can tell when you’ll get blessed.
 Or challenged.
 Or both.
 A woman of kind and friendly demeanor comes into Chapters, a coffee shop bookstore in Newberg, Oregon, about a half hour from Portland.
 I’ll call this woman Curly.
 Though she's older than most college students, as her sweatshirt is lettered “George Fox,” I ask if she goes to nearby George Fox University.
 She gives me a rather wistful smile.

 But I have to tell you that I'd give anything in this world to have you stay here with me.
 I love you so much."
 Fresh tears rolled down her cheeks, and she laid her head on his shoulder.
 She dabbed at her tears with Rick's handkerchief, noticing that it smelled like his cologne.
 She was going to keep it and take it back with her.
 She'd remember every kiss they'd ever shared whenever she smelled it.

The right of veto should be rescinded with respect to this most crucial issue.
 A time-bound plan should be drawn up by the UN for complete and total nuclear disarmament by all nations.
 Ban on ballistic missiles
 Nuclear devices are the most lethal class of weapons, but much of their threat arises from the development of ballistic missile technology which can deliver them to distant targets unmanned and without risk to the aggressor.
 Even if nuclear weapons are eliminated, these vehicles can be utilized to carry large conventional payloads that strike terror in a distant population.
 The danger to all nations of unexpected and unprovoked attack from near or distant powers can be vastly reduced by declaring an immediate ban on the use of ballistic missiles of all types, including those carrying conventional warheads.
 This proposal, first put forth by US President Reagan in 1986, would eliminate the discriminatory provisions that deny missile acquisition to some, while preserving the right of others to maintain and develop this purely offensive capability.
 It would also eliminate the need for missile defence systems, which no nation can afford and which are the only possible defence against ballistic missile weapons.
 The ban on use should be followed by urgent measures to dismantle and scrap this entire class of weapons worldwide.
 Technically, a prohibition on testing and deployment of ballistic missiles would be far more verifiable than any limits on nuclear proliferation.

But under conditions of shortages in economies dominated by huge monopolistic enterprises, price deregulation led to skyrocketing prices and spiralling inflation.
 A market flourishes only when several essential conditions are met – freedom of pricing, freedom of entry and exit from industry, free flow of information, unrestricted movement of goods and services, competition between enterprises, control of monopolies, and private ownership of property.
 The entire package of free market practices must be implemented hand in hand, otherwise it does not work.
 Freeing pricing without first regulating or dismantling monopolies, promoting privatization of land and enterprises, ensuring free flow of goods, and establishing wholesale markets and multiple distribution out lets lead to speculation, soaring prices, hoarding and falling production.
 Historically, the free market evolved over centuries in conditions of surplus production and stable currency, neither of which exist in Eastern Europe today.
 Efforts to accelerate the development of the market will have first of all to meet the political, legal, social and economic conditions historically required for its creation.
 And these conditions must be met simultaneously.
 4.Macro-economic stability is a precondition for increasing production: It is extremely difficult to increase production in a context of general macro-economic instability and hyperinflation.
 The rapidly falling value of local currencies minimized their utility as a medium of exchange.
 Agricultural as well as industrial enterprises seeking a stable medium in which to hold their wealth increasingly resorted to hoarding marketable, non-perishable commodities such as food grains or converting local currency into foreign money wherever possible.

On his way back home, the threepence jingling in his hand, Harruq spotted a patrol of guards approaching.
 He glanced to the right, where the small alley led back to their shed.
 If he hurried, he might be able to make it before they noticed…
 He was halfway down the alley when he heard a voice call out.
 “Hey!”
 Harruq kept going.
 He was used to harassment and verbal abuse from the guards.
 Once out of sight, though, he was usually out of mind.
 He relied on that as he turned a corner into the small space around their shed.
 Qurrah, who had been resting on the shallow grass, hurried to his feet at Harruq’s approach.

The volley continued and whenever my anger showed, the rock came harder, faster, so I tried to control the emotion or at least hide it.
 That was the hardest part.
 Eventually, I found the best defense was to block the attacks by deflecting them with other objects.
 His magic was too powerful to counter directly and he’d prevented me from ducking away.
 When I was blocking about half the strikes successfully, he pocketed the stone and progressed with sticks, water, fire, anything he found on the trail.
 We were still riding too fast and I was exhausted from the mental and physical exertion when he switched to full-body attacks.
 By nightfall I wasn’t able to fend off anything that came at me and he mercifully stopped the horses beneath another hollow in the mountain.
 I was asleep practically before I slid off my horse.
 The next morning I woke to the sound of rock against rock.
 There was no sign of Chevelle or his horse in the dim stone hollow.

My feet were frozen in place.
 I could only think of one thing: Fight fire with fire.
 I flung my arm toward the incoming stream of flames and a tongue of fire akin to a dragon’s shot out and collided with it.
 I was shocked.
 I’d only used my power to light candles and lanterns.
 I’d had no idea I could produce such a vicious plume of flames.
 I looked to Chevelle.
 “Yes,” he exalted.
 He raised his arms above his head to construct a massive circle of blazing heat.
 When his eyes returned to mine, he smiled.

I wanted to be with him while he slept, even if it was only for a couple of hours.
 Everyone in the pack already knew I'd spent the night.
 In the end, the reasonable part of me never had a chance.
 Waking up next to Alec fully vindicated my decision.
 He'd greeted me with his typical, heart-stopping smile and I'd leaned in to kiss him before I'd even realized I was in motion.
 He'd pulled back, but his expression at least wasn't reproachful.
 I wanted to force the issue, wanted it so badly I could feel the desire bubbling inside me, but even more than my natural shyness, the thought of him pulling away again, this time in disgust, was too much to contemplate.
 Once we got to school, I'd found the rampant gossip had subsided to a dull rumble, but the few undecided votes had come down solidly on the side of everyone else.
 Some people hated me for using Brandon, others hated me for playing Alec, while a small, but decidedly upwardly-mobile group disliked me for achieving not just one, but both of the conquests they'd been dreaming of since grade school.
 In the end, it didn't really matter why everyone disliked me.

Qurrah closed his eyes and hoped no significant enchantments guarded the fence.
 If any did, they fizzled against the magic of the ancient sword.
 Harruq sliced two of the bars cleanly, and a third dented in enough so that a follow up chop cut it like butter.
 Pleased, Harruq took two of the bars into his hands.
 His neck bulged, his arm muscles tensed, and then the iron screeched backward.
 Both winced at the noise.
 They did not move for the next five minutes.
 When both felt comfortable, Harruq shoved the third bar forward, giving them a nice clean entrance.
 The two brothers slipped under, the bigger half-orc having to press his arms together to squeeze through.
 They slunk across the lawn to the front door.

 "It depends on the 23-year-old girl."

Thomas Richard was born on a cold December day to parents who were children themselves.
 I followed just 13 months later, and another brother was born 14 months later and died almost immediately after his birth.
 My mother at 20 years old had two toddlers and had to accept the death of her third baby.
 Years later, I returned to this town and located the home we first shared.
 The home, which had since been converted into a one car garage, still had the old front door located next to a single car garage door that had been put in place of what was once the front window.
 It seemed impossible that it could have ever have been anything but a garage.

Emily raised her hands and roots twisted upward, trying to encase Kojas but he kept slashing them away.
 Jason attempted to distract him by running around throwing knives at him but I think Jason was too busy ducking the black stuff that shot out of Kojas’ hands.
 I ran right past all of them and towards Seth.
 I knelt down and smacked him across his good cheek.
 “Ow, what was that for?” he grunted.
 “I don’t have enough bruises for your liking?” “That’s for being a jerk and not telling us you were going to fight Kojas on your own,” I said angrily.
 “Hey in my defense, he found me first.” I opened my mouth to say something smart, but I hear Emily scream.
 I turned around to see Jason crash into a tree and not move.
 Seth jumped up and grabbed his sword from the ground.
 He ran for Kojas.

 That is all that matters.

 Aurelia had heard enough.
 She knew their roles, the balance and position of their hearts.
 It was absurd, poor souls without a home, family, or position to be speaking of power and obligation.
 Her hatred of their unknown master grew.
 He was a puppet-master, and her dear friend was one of his puppets.
 If they still doubted, even for a moment, perhaps she could save them.
 Perhaps there was still time to pull them from the necromancer’s cold fingers.

She grunted and let go, growled and stepped over the bear’s body.
 He slowly reached up, and using the full strength of his body, pushed hard on her muscular chest, pushing her away from the bear’s haunch.
 He then ignored her and went back to cutting the haunch loose.
 He waited but the two lionesses seemed to have gone from aggression to napping, with him missing the transition.
 Slowly, Rodregas got up with his bear haunch and took it back to the barn.
 He met the surprised look of Doi’van and Imeralda with a half smile, “I hope you like the taste of bear?” As he was unsure of how old the meat was, he immediately started a fire and started to cook it.
 As he worked on preparing the fire he explained what had happened.
 “Are you suicidal?” asked Imeralda in an angry voice.
 “I know you felt they were not a danger, but to walk up and take the food from two Dire Cats?
 That is just asking to be killed.” Her voice was unusually high pitched and she was shaking her head in disbelief.

Reduced confrontation between nation states has been followed by an aggravation of internal conflicts within countries as well as a dramatic increase in threats of violence by disenchanted minorities.
 Violent local conflicts continue to flare around the world.
 Terrorist acts have intensified against civilian populations on every continent.
 While the worst fears about rising unemployment in the West have been dispelled, the challenge of generating sufficient employment opportunities for all people around the world remains a pressing concern.
 The rich-poor divide has increased within and between nations.
 Inadequate job/livelihood opportunities resulting in inadequate purchasing power have now become the most important cause of endemic and hidden hunger.
 Most regrettable has been the failure to enhance the powers and strengthen reliance on effective multilateral institutions.
 The emergence of the USA as the sole superpower has brought with it a reduction in the role and influence of the UN in international affairs, precisely at a time when the world should be striving to build a viable multilateral cooperative security system.

“Watch where you’re going… Jazell, look out!” Jason suddenly yelled.
 I dove onto the ground and felt the monster brush past me.
 I looked up to see Jason rolling on the ground before jumping on the faery jerk’s back.
 He yelled at Jason right before I saw the knife disappear somewhere in his neck.
 The faery’s yells turned to screams and then nothing.
 He fell to the ground and Jason brushed himself off.
 “You okay, Jazell?” he asked me and held out a hand.
 I took his hand and he pulled me up.
 “Yup, I’m just peachy.” “At least you can use sarcasm in a time like this,” he said and started to fight his way through the crowd.

My confusion must have been more than usually self-evident as I sat up.
 "No, Mother isn't going through a good episode.
 She's asleep.
 Rachel crept into her room and crawled into bed with her.
 It's a poor substitute for what she aches for, but it's all Mother can offer right now."
 "Alec, there must be something we can do."
 He gently captured my hands, stilling their frantic motion and shook his head.
 "Not right now.
 Rachel cherishes her few remaining illusions.
 One of the most important is the pretense that nobody knows just how hard it is sometimes for her to be the only human in a house full of shape shifters."

 I couldn’t say I didn’t still want revenge though.
 What he must feel toward me for taking so much from him.
 My mind was reclassifying every look he’d ever given me, everything that had happened since I’d met him.
 Why he hadn’t looked at me as I’d lain under the tree in the meadow, explaining why Fannie had struck me.
 Why I’d wanted to learn transfer magic… to get my mother’s things.
 The look he’d given the pendant on my neck… my mother’s pendant.
 Of course he’d volunteered to be my watcher.
 I had taken everything from him.
 My thoughts began to muddle as my mother and my dreams and my own life twisted together.

So it makes most sense for you to have it.” He started handing her the Mithril chain armor.
 Her eyes grew bright at the sight of the silver chain and she went, “Oh, my god, you bastard!
 You had this in the wagon all along.
 Do I really get to have it?” Rodregas smiled and said, “As long as you are sharing the journey with us.” She took several moments to appreciate the armor and started to try it on; Rodregas waited, enjoying her appreciation of his stolen gift.
 Just as she started to calm down he said, “Oh, and didn’t you say something about wanting a bow?
 And quietly, he handed her one of the Black Yew recurves.
 She reached for it with a smile and as soon as she touched it she just stared at it.
 Her expression of wonder made his old dried up heart smile.
 He was not sure how to feel, like a pleased father giving out mid-winter gifts to children, or like a young lover giving flowers to a new crush.
 Rodregas was unsure which reaction was proper now, and which she would want him to feel.

 “I don't know how, I just do.
 Maybe that's my power.” “Well, I want to go this way,” I said and pointed to the entrance.
 “If something like that is on the entrance, I want to know where this goes.” “I agree but aren't we supposed to be trying to find Emily and Jason?” “I have an idea,” I said and pulled my bow off my back.
 I removed one of my arrows and put my bow on the ground.
 I walked over to Seth and pulled his sword out of its sheath.
 He grabbed for it but I already had it in my hands.
 I put the tip against the arrow and carved the same sign as the one on the wall.
 Then I tossed Seth's sword back at him, which he caught without a problem, and picked up my bow.
 I notched the carved arrow and released it.

Jim – Most of those names aren’t well known, and the people who do know them would die of laughter rather than of fear.
 Liz – Use a modern monster name then, like King Kong or Dracula or something.
 Eugene – Hey great!
 I know, Godzilla.
 It’s perfect.
 GODZILLA!
 Jim – Godzilla is just a guy in a dinosaur costume.
 You’d do about as well taking the name Barney.
 Maybe then you’d get people to hug you.
 Eugene – Non-believer.

“Stupid elfie,” he said, gingerly touching the arrow in his neck.
 Not knowing what else to do, he closed his hand about the shaft and pulled.
 A minute later, still lying in agonizing pain, the half-orc managed to pry open one of his healing potions.
 He gulped the swirling blue-silver contents and then tossed the vial.
 Ripping the other arrow out of his side, he felt a warm, soothing sensation fill his body.
 “Are you alright?” he heard a raspy voice ask from atop the stairs.
 “Yeah, I’m fine.
 Just had to take care of something here.”
 He trudged down the stairs to where Qurrah waited.
 “How many did you kill?” the necromancer asked.

My life for you, _Qurrah shouted as the world crystallized.
 A red line slashed across his mind, and as the dream shattered into shards the words of the dark man ripped through him._
 Then come reap the rewards.
 Qurrah lurched awake, gasping for air.
 His throat ached, and he could feel the tiniest trickle of blood down his trachea.
 The night was still deep and the town quiet.
 Beside him, Harruq snored loud enough to wake the drunkest of men.
 Far away, a wolf howl beckoned.
 “Sleep well,” Qurrah said, leaving the town.
 His doubt faded with each step.

She slipped her hand into his, something she never would have done in 1927.
 "This has to be as strange for you as it is for me.
 But you've treated me so well, almost-almost as if you knew me."
 He looked down at the small hand in his.
 "I, um, I-I've read a lot about the 1920s.
 When I finally realized that you really were from 1927, I-I thought it would be interesting to talk to someone from the ‘20s."
 He looked up with a smile.
 "What do beautiful 23-year-old girls do for fun in 1927?"
 "It depends on the 23-year-old girl."
 She returned his smile.

Alec wasn't talking, but from the way he was scanning the room, he didn't want to be there anymore than the rest of them.
 I made it to Brandon's table, and was still pulling my meal replacement drink out of my bag when the loudspeaker clicked on with the obligatory burst of static.
 "This is Principal Gossil and I've got an exciting announcement.
 The school is sponsoring a trip to Las Vegas to see the production of Les Misérables that just started.
 Tickets are available at a discounted rate in the office for the next two days."
 It was like someone had rifled through my mind to pick out my biggest disappointment in recent days, pulled it out and rubbed salt on the wound before cramming it back inside me.
 Of course I'd go see how big of a discount the school had gotten the tickets at, but it was extremely unlikely my tiny check would end up being enough.
 It took me a moment to realize Mr. Gossil hadn't ended his announcement.
 "...those wishing to be entered into the drawing should stop by the office between today and noon tomorrow."
 In the face of the near-universal apathy expressed by the rest of the student body, it took my mind several seconds to process exactly what had been said.

Handing him a tub of butter, she caught his gaze, holding it as she thought about the way he'd kissed her yesterday afternoon.
 Entranced by Marie's beautiful hazel eyes, Rick drew her close and bent his head to kiss her.
 Seconds later, he was startled by a giggle that interrupted their kiss.
 "What's so funny?"
 he demanded.
 "It works!"
 "What works?"
 "I thought about kissing you while I was looking at you, and you kissed me!"
 He shook his head.
 "So you were experimenting.

With the basics I suppose, you already know about the mechanics of sex, but it’s up to me to fill you in on men themselves.
 Men are stupid.
 I mean it in the most loving way possible.
 But, men are stupid.
 They’re blind, they don’t see or understand what is standing right in front of them, what is absolutely plain to you and I.
 Take you’re friend Jim for example, I doubt its even crossed his mind that you have any romantic interest in him what-so-ever.
 He is blissfully un-aware that you have been mooning over him for the last ten years of your lives, though I think you could have made a better choice.
 Liz – Mother, we’ve been over this before…
 Cleo – Yes, yes, I know you’re sticking with Jim, and hoping that one day he’ll see the light.

She knew it must have been some kind of deep cut for me to persist in it for, what, a couple weeks, a little longer.

 Shit.

 Oh—the song, yeah, anyway, that’s what the song is about, that lost time, that time I went away and came back.
 I still like the lyrics: I still imagine a face white like faith’s hue and a dimple carved there and a disdain for any attention.
 How attractive these qualities are.
 How they still reverberate across the gulf of time.
 It really is a gulf, deep like an ode, and dark as if dipped in death-shadow.

Ultimately I think most of us just want a compelling story, but sometimes the labels that get applied to books get in the way of us discovering them, rather than helping as they are meant to do.
 I think one of the things that made the Harry Potter books so successful was the fact that the whole family could share in the series.
 I remember as Twilight came out thinking that there were plenty of guys who would enjoy Twilight if they ever sat down and read it, but most of them wouldn't ever give it a try.
 My hope with Broken and Torn is that the two stories combine into something that both guys and girls can enjoy.
 The girls are likely to start out with Broken, while guys are likely to pick up Torn and enjoy the extra action there.
 Either way, my biggest hope would be that the guys can introduce their wives and girlfriends to Broken, and the girls can introduce their husbands and boyfriends to Torn.
 We've included excerpts for both Torn and Splintered (the sequel for Broken and Torn) below.
 Acknowledgments: A big thanks to all of the fans who are doing so much to help get the word out.
 There are tons of you that I don't know, but I do want to make special mention of a few dependable souls that I'm very grateful to know, and who've helped in various ways with Torn, and who I suspect will continue to go above and beyond with Broken.
 Cassy & Mark, I'm glad you both turned out to be story addicts just like me.

My family’s loud simultaneous gasps accompanied Harry and Bryce’s rush to restrain me as if I was going to continue the beating.
 Maybe kill Brandon.
 This is how angry we all were.
 How out of our element.
 And now I’d done it.
 Lisa jumped up screaming and crying and yelled, “Stop!” Brandon lay face down and his blood soaked the carpet beneath his head; his hands clutched his face; he moaned and rolled over.
 Blood oozed from between his clenched fingers and ran down his chest when he sat up.
 My wife was hysterical and rightfully so.
 I stood there numb, wondering what I had done and how did my efforts to be the best father I could be turn into this?
 I’d hit him—once.

She jabbed her staff upward, pushing the two attacks high and giving her room underneath.
 Ducking forward, she tried to strike the half-orc’s leg.
 She badly underestimated Harruq’s new speed though, and one blade looped around to block the attack.
 The other went straight down, the edge smashing hard against the top of Aurelia’s skull.
 While it did not draw blood, the jolt of it knocked the elf to one knee and gave her a dull ache in her head.
 “Have you lost your mind?” Aurelia asked as she rolled away.
 Harruq’s mad charge was her answer, and it sparked fear in her heart.
 Sword strikes assailed her impossibly fast.
 Any thought of the fight being practice left Aurelia’s mind.
 It felt too real.

The pain in his shoulder threatened to send him into shock.
 It was just waiting for his body to succumb.
 His eyes searched for anything that could grant him cover.
 The forest was too far, and all about was shin-high grass.
 “No choice,” he gasped.
 His entire right half of his body ached.
 “Celestia, grant me mercy.
 I cannot go further.”
 He stumbled to the ground.
 His face and armor were camouflaged with greens and browns, but just grass would make it difficult to go unnoticed.

But in her expression, I read the same message I got from Karen’s sweet face.
 It said, I’ve been hurt bad and know how it feels so I’ll be nice to everybody and try not to make anybody else feel that way.
 A thousand and some miles from home, I was lonely enough to once again ache for a best friend.
 So while I admired this barmaid, who looked about three months pregnant, I dreamed she and I would roam until we discovered the right small town, where we didn’t know anybody.
 There she could leave behind the sorrow of getting ditched by the creep who knocked her up.
 I meant to love her baby like my own.
 But on the third evening, not long after she had sat with me and chatted in a dovelike voice about strange and outrageous visitors to the bar, a guy with several tattoos came for her.
 As she walked out with him, she waved goodbye to me.
 Earlier that day, I had noticed a Kitchen Help Wanted sign in a coffee shop.
 Since I hoped to become an instant father, in order to show the waitress my responsible side, I inquired about the job.

I padded silently through the long, dark halls.
 Emily and Jason walked wordlessly by my side.
 No one spoke because there was nothing to say, and so much to say, at the same time.
 It had been almost a day since Seth disappeared.
 A day since Kojas took him.
 I had told him, when he had first said that Kojas wanted to use him that he didn’t have to worry.
 I should have known that Kojas would do anything to get him, and now Seth was gone.
 After he had been taken and Jason had awakened, the faery jerks had scattered.
 Then a light pixie had showed up, the same one who had saved my life a while ago, and led us all the way to her majesty’s place.
 She was apparently the queen but she was nothing like a stuck up royal leader.

 You’re supposed to leave tomorrow, so you better pack.” “I’m going to go do that.” I said quickly, while I backed up towards the stairs.
 As soon as I reached them, I shot up so fast you would think I was running for my life.
 I closed the door, locking it behind me and then dialed Emily’s cell phone as fast as I could.
 I sat on my bed as the phone rang three times before I heard it click.
 “Jazell you wouldn’t believe what my parents just told me.

 I hear her breathe heavily, “This is crazy, it’s just happening too fast.

 But the thing is we don’t know where this meeting place is and-” She was cut off by the ringing of my phone.

There was a scene.
 And, of course, we were too young, but we managed to hang out on the fringes for a while, until we became accepted, through the music, through the music.
 And about the time I would have graduated from high school we got the chance to make that album, what we thought was our big break, our rocket to stardom.
 So, while my girlfriend and my friends and ex-friends were preparing for baccalaureate, we were rehearsing songs in that old gas station for Turntable Poison.
 It was a heady time.
 CM:  	You had a girlfriend at that time?
 BG: 	Of course, I mean, yeah.

 "I'm not sure what to tell you.

 More importantly, you're better off not knowing."
 I waited for several seconds, expecting him to go on, and then finally realized the matter was closed as far as he was concerned.
 "Hold on there.
 You can't just leave me in the dark about all of this.
 I'm in up to my neck; you have to at least let me know what I've fallen into."
 He was shaking his head again.
 "I'm sorry, I know this has to be hard, but you don't belong in this world.

However, rising demand within developing countries themselves will limit overall growth of exports, and increasing exports will push up domestic food prices, unless much greater priority is given to matching production with opportunities for home and external trade.
 Increased private investment
 The modernization of the farm sector greatly needs the investment, technology, professional management and marketing expertise which private firms can bring.
 Wherever land reforms have resulted in the division of farms into small parcels, farmers need to be supported by well-organized services, particularly for post-harvest handling, provided either by companies or co-operatives.
 Economic liberalization offers expanded opportunities for private enterprise to work with small producers in a wide range of agro-industries to combine the social benefits of small holdings with the economies and marketing expertise of corporate management.
 The contract system of agricultural production introduced in backward regions of Thailand has enabled small farmers to work closely with private businesses to produce labour-intensive, value-added crops, with technology, training and marketing provided by the companies, resulting in a rapid rise of farm incomes and job opportunities.
 Developing countries possess significant advantages in terms of climate, year-round production and low labour costs that are conducive to foreign investment.
 With private capital flows on the rise, there is an opportunity for developing countries to upgrade technology and obtain direct access to foreign markets by providing a conducive atmosphere for foreign investments and collaborations in agri-business ventures, such as hybrid seed production, flowers, processed fruit and vegetables, fresh and salt water aquaculture, and sericulture.
 Shift from commodity-based to resource-based planning
 The responsibility of governments to achieve dramatic increases in foodgrain production to keep pace with population growth naturally led to a commodity-based approach to agricultural development in many developing countries.

He reached out to me and I stepped toward him, tears streaming down my cheeks.
 He wrapped his arms around me as I turned again to see my mother.
 A howl of rage escaped her and I started to go to her, but he held me.
 He was restraining me.
 I thrashed against him as I tried to scream, to tell him to let me go, but I had no voice.
 She reached her hand out and I could not move, could not help her, though I knew she was dying.
 I was imprisoned there, unable to move… unable to scream… unable to save her.
 And then I couldn’t see her.
 Something was covering my eyes.
 I struggled yet again but my body felt like lead—heavy, useless.

That is impossible!” “Can we wait one moment?” asked Imeralda raising her hand.
 “I think we need to bring Doi’van in to be part of this conversation.” Rodregas just nodded, stunned at the news.
 As Imeralda left the room to get Doi’van, Jordaan stepped closer and slowly moved his hand from Rodregas’ feet to his head, his eyes half closed.
 Rodregas wondered what he could sense.
 “You are a Nymph of the flesh?” Rodregas asked him.
 Contrary to his early good mood, the Nymph froze at those words.
 With a hesitant smile the green haired Nymph said, “We actually prefer the term Nymph of Life.
 Truly, life is as powerful an element as any.” “Sorry,” Rodregas said, realizing he had accidentally insulted the healer, “I have never spent much time with Nymphs.” Rodregas’ tone was quieter.
 The Nymph seemed young and smart and gifted.
 Rodregas knew he did not have to like him.

"It's harder to control the instincts, the beast inside us, if you will, while we're in an alternate form.
 Hybrid, wolf, cat, to one extent or another, we become the beast, and if there's one thing animals have figured out, it's that you don't survive by letting a beaten opponent live to learn from their mistakes."

 I've been working with James every day since then, but he hasn't really come around yet, so he is still a bit of a problem.
 Luckily, with Alec and Isaac both firmly on your side, and Jasmin starting to develop a liking for you, there isn't a thing those two can really do about it.
 As long as Alec is very careful to stay between the two of them and you, you really don't have a reason to worry."

The braided, lacquered leather reinforced with the steel scales provided decent protection for most fights.
 This style of armor was vulnerable to a highly skilled swordsman.
 But for someone wanting some protection from the dangers of the road, it was better than most civilian armor.
 There were matching pants and even boots.
 He quickly dressed and felt much better once armored.
 He had spent most of his adult life in armor; he just could not relax when he wore only clothes.
 Rodregas then looked around; the keep armory was pretty basic with casks of arrows and spears, and some of the older used short swords and bows on the wall.
 There were only two truly powerful weapons like those used by a member of the Immortal Guards – the soldiers that enforced the rule of the Immortalist Guild of the Celestial Path who ruled all the Eastern Kingdoms and neither of these weapons were kept in the armory.
 He looked over to the short swords laying on one of the tables and picked two of them up; they felt a little weird.
 The swords were too light and the balance seemed off as he took a few practice strokes.

Dean Moriarty et al.
 In Sometimes a Great Notion, Joe Ben used to be, as a teen, so handsome and so enthralled by girls, he never could have stayed true to any one of them.
 But a motorcycle crash disfigured his perfect face.
 Still, his girlfriend sticks by him.
 She becomes his wife and the mother of his kids.
 And Joe Ben comes to believe that God had allowed that tragedy to save him from the fate of his father, who died a lonely, sex-obsessed drunk.
 Joe Ben is the book’s endearing and admirable character, a humble Christian of supreme courage.
 A vision, I believe, of what Cassady could have become had he overcome his demons.

 They were the purest blue I'd ever seen, and looking into them was like trying to plumb the depths of a bottomless spring.
 I could see further into him than I ever could with Brandon, and there wasn't any deception there.
 I nodded, and then buried my face against his chest as I cried myself out.
 It was several minutes before I was able to speak again.
 "You're so ready to send me away it's hard to believe sometimes that you really want me here."
 Alec stroked the side of my face, ending by tucking a strand of hair back in place behind my ear.
 "I really want nothing as badly as I want you here.
 If I were to be completely selfish I'd never have even made the offer, but that wouldn't have been fair to you."
 I snuggled closer to him.

“Can I bring you two into the Chamber as my advisors?” “That does seem to be allowed,” said Imeralda, “Traditionally that is more about fathers with sons, not half bloods and Hellborns, but I think we might have a bigger problem.” She stopped speaking mid sentence, and Rodregas curiously looked back at her, but she was staring ahead.
 A figure stood there tall and graceful.
 He had appeared out of nowhere, as if by magic.
 It was Van’dret.
 “Ah, I see the three of you are all together and far away from the others, how convenient for me.” Van’dret casually reached out toward the side wall and they could vaguely hear him mumble a few words.
 A second later the sound of doors slamming and bolts and locks sliding closed echoed from every direction.
 “I hope you don’t mind, but I don’t think I want to be interrupted.” Rodregas reached for his sword, but found he did not have one.
 He froze for but a second, unsure of what to do.
 Then Van’dret spit on the ground and spoke a guttural sound.
 Suddenly Rodregas’ and the others’ feet were stuck to the ground, and no matter how hard they pulled their feet would not move.

In an effort to try and balance things out the dream angels granted me another vivid dream on Sunday night.
 It was wonderful.
 I got to swim around in the most glorious pond known to man.
 I was somehow faster than normal, and spent what seemed like hours chasing around slivers of light that turned out to be some kind of long, thin fish.
 For perhaps the first time in my entire life I didn't mind at all that I'd ended up in a swimsuit so small I might as well have been wearing nothing at all.
 In fact, the feel of the warm water sliding past my skin was so incredible I almost considered skinny dipping.
 Of course that'd only lasted for about a nanosecond.
 Even in a dream, there were things that were just too scary to really entertain.
 The dream lasted longer than any of the others before it, but even so it eventually lapsed into a normal, boring dream.
 Still, I woke up feeling more refreshed and rested than any other time I could remember.

That’s what I think anyway.
 I mean, in the middle of Beatlemania, when he had the fucking world by the tail, we thought, he’s singing “Help me if you can.”  And nobody was listening man.
 He was a squonk crying in the wilderness.
 God love him.
 I think he’s happier now, doing his own shit, not having to answer to anybody except John Lennon.
 That’s the way I am.
 I mean, I’m not claiming to be Lennon—Jesus, no—but, I was always a solo artist and in the straightjacket of a group I was itching to get to the good stuff, the stuff I cared about.
 It’s not worth grousing about, I mean, I had a good run in that group, but my solo albums are the only ones I care about.
 So, sophomore year, Debby is gone—well, I cut her loose, I’m not proud of it.
 There was this freshman chick with big tits who just threw herself in my way.

 Someone was in front of me.

 I threw my hands back to steady myself.
 It felt like a wall of stones behind me.
 I didn’t look back, though, because just as I’d regained my footing, I heard the howls.
 Before the next breath, a new sound—a closer sound—filled my ears.
 Shoosh, shoosh, shoosh.

“True,” Rodregas replied, “but it is pretty.
 And I would love to be facing them with one of those blue steel swords.” “Now don’t go lowering your standards, blue steel and night bronze?
 Good enough for the common soldier, but I fancy something a little more distinctive.” Rodregas was about to ask him what he had in mind when they found out why they had been waiting; two more slavers came up with drawn bows.
 They were going to take them from a safe distance.
 Doi’van and he needed no words; they both knew only instant action gave them a chance.
 Rodregas would like to have tried to take on one of the Immortal Guards, but he had already noticed that the slaver with the mace was a little too close and a little too far away from his nearest companion.
 He was a skinny man with dirty hair and seemed to be having trouble holding his heavy weapon.
 Rodregas stepped in close and the slaver swung the mace with surprising force, but he met it with the shield and knocked it aside.
 Rodregas moved with simply too much speed to be blocked.
 He slid the short sword into the slaver’s stomach and gutted him in a quick and vicious move.

The other half learned about it at church the next day."
 I tried to smile, but I found it more than a little unnerving.
 Big city life hadn't been so intrusive.
 I hadn't even known my neighbors growing up.
 In Minneapolis the people you lived next to and the people you associated with were always kept properly segregated.
 I tuned back into what Britney was saying just in time to answer a question with something safely non-committal.
 She didn't seem to need much in the way of responses to keep her talking.
 Probably for hours if she could get away with it.
 "I'm glad you feel the same.

He smoothed it down and we walked across the flat ground.
 The ground had spots of grass sticking out of sand and rock.
 Luckily, there was no wind down here to toss up the sand and dirt.
 I think I passed the spot where the Kojas had stood in my dream.
 I threw the thoughts out of my head and tried to think of something else.
 Like, where this flat plain of flatness ended.
 “Where are we going, anyway?” I asked and stared at the sky.
 It was going to get dark soon.
 He looked up at me through his hair.
 I could see the curved end of his lip, which met he was smiling.

He was beautiful.
 “Don’t touch,” barked Doi’van.
 Rodregas nodded, he knew not to touch, but then realized that his hand was raised and had been reaching out to stroke the lion’s mane.
 He knew that this was the greater sigil that he wanted to gain.
 It was in a perfect circle.
 He had taken in the essence of the Celestial Lion back at Raven Keep, and now Rodregas would consume his own magical power with the greater sigil of a Celestial Lion and become a perfect vessel for its power.
 Rodregas forced himself to step back.
 This was their chance for Doi’van, and he would get a second chance if needed.
 He looked over at the other two.
 Once Rodregas had turned around from the lion, Doi’van started to walk between the pedestals joining Imeralda at looking around.

I hope that this book and the website http://www.rxdrugaddict.comcan help addicts better understand that they are not just destroying themselves but also their family and friends.
 I hope they can see that they could have long and productive lives if they chose to feel life instead of numbing it.
 I also hope this can help people to think about their defining moments and to never give up on their addicted loved ones.
 Expecting someone to just stop being addicted is as absurd as asking someone to stop having cancer.
 These addicts need professional help from those who are trained in this field.
 We are ignorant and ill prepared to help and understand an addict and that ignorance could be deadly.
 We can only pray that these addicts can overcome their addiction and start living a clean and sober life one day at a time.

That's not really important though.
 Let's get you inside."
 I nodded and started towards the door, only to blink as Alec stepped in front of me.
 "May I have permission to enter and make sure it's safe inside?"
 I slowed down, suddenly terrified at the thought of Brandon and his friends waiting inside for me.
 "I thought you said you'd be able to smell them if they were here."
 "If they were outside, yes.
 Under normal circumstances we'd be able to determine whether or not they'd been here in the last few days, but the rainstorm last night was strong enough to wash away all of that."
 Alec waited patiently as I tried to get a grip on myself.
 As soon as I nodded he disappeared through the door.

He reached down and took the purse off his belt.
 Rodregas opened it to find only a few silvers.
 He knew Korin should have more.
 He opened his shirt and, as he suspected, another purse hung from his neck.
 It was of flat leather and inside it were twelve pieces of silver and a small book.
 Rodregas tentatively touched the book and it buzzed slightly of magic.
 It held no foulness so he tossed it into the trunk.
 He added the coin purses to the robe he was wearing.
 He still needed more hard money and some decent clothes.
 Rodregas looked out the window to see a few people leaving the keep grounds, and a few still hanging around the yard.

Doi’van wilted like a flower without water in the sun; he literally sat down on the ground.
 Rodregas simply sagged as the truth behind the half AElf’s words sank in.
 Jordaan simply stood watching the scene, without his normal expression of cheer.
 Finally Rodregas turned to Jordaan and said, “Imeralda is right and I apologize for our anger.
 It is misplaced.
 My life and the life of my friend are well worth the price and we are in your debt.” At Rodregas’ words Jordaan simply nodded and then stepped into the trees, disappearing as the Nymphs had a habit of doing when in nature.
 “I had better go apologize to Imeralda,” said Rodregas.
 “You should wait a while and let her rage cool first,” suggested Doi’van slowly.
 He spoke as one who was very familiar with rage.
 Rodregas realized that Doi’van was probably right so he sat back and tried to think of the right words to speak when the timing was better.

 I swore under my breath and took off for the woods.
 My feet crunched on the fallen branches and leaves.
 I could see the creature ahead of me.
 I didn’t have much time.
 I placed my bag on the ground and crossed my legs.

Both his office and his neighbors were close but not too close, and he had a beautiful lawn in the front and a large patio and flower garden in the back.
 Rick smiled as he walked into his kitchen, loosening his tie.
 Lauri moaned every time she walked into the garden.
 What a waste, she always sighed, looking at him with reproach.
 A woman would love having that garden, but what did a man know about flowers?
 Truthfully, he knew very little, Rick mused as he set his cartons of Chinese on the counter and went to change clothes.
 He just knew that he enjoyed their beauty and scent.
 But he could never admit that to Lauri; she'd accuse him of being a romantic.
 He really was, deep down, he supposed.
 But he'd had so many bad experiences that he was rapidly becoming something of a cynic.

And he certainly hadn't apologized.

 She couldn't wait to go to the shore.
 After her walk through the garden, Rick wanted to go back to bed for a while, but she begged him to leave right away.
 Excitedly she put on her bathing suit, glad that there was no full-length mirror in her room.
 Rick had assured her that her bathing suit was very modest for 2011, but she still felt apprehensive as she stepped into the hall.

It gathered in my hair, leaving it a matted mess with the single braid—Ruby’s handiwork—dripping condensation over the shoulder of my cloak.
 I decided to practice as we rode, closing my eyes to sink partially into my horse, still alert to my own self and the outside world.
 It was there, leading my horse and seeing through his eyes, that the pain struck.
 It came on instantaneously, hitting me like a blade, cutting, shearing.
 It was accompanied by sharpness of sound as well.
 My ears were in excruciating pain.
 The horse dropped, his head smacked to the ground and I watched through his eyes as he hit.
 The animal’s senses stilled, not panicked as my own.
 I didn’t understand what was happening, couldn’t quite form a thought.
 I yearned to retreat into the horse, run from the agony, but the severity of it tore me back and kept me there in my own head.

 Toad dwarf said to Jazell, “The one will rise, the one will rise!
 He will destroy you!” Is Kojas’ rising?
 Toad dwarf said to Jason, “The King will rise.” She placed her notes in the middle so we could read it.
 “What does this all mean?” I asked her.
 She was silent, “I guess the person they’re talking about is Kojas, but we don’t know who he is, or if he’s important.” “Well, I’m thinking he’s important because these weird dwarfs keep talking about him.
 Maybe he’s their idol or something.” I said.
 “Well,” Seth stated, “maybe we should ask the dwarfs where he is.” “That’ll be hard.” Emily pointed out.
 “They hardly tell us anything as it is.

"Any slower and you'd have been cut off from the rest of us by those mutts."
 My confusion must have been obvious.
 Dominic looked up from Jess.
 "Vincent and Cassie cut Jess and Isaac off from the rest of us."
 Rachel leaned in so she could whisper.
 "Jess is terrified of what Vincent and Brandon will do to her if they get a chance.
 She collapsed, and then everyone stormed the area."
 The limo hit a particularly nasty bump, and a wave of pain drove questions about what exactly Brandon had threatened out of my mind.
 I'd never noticed how bad the roads between school and Alec's house were.
 Each jostle sent waves of agony up my leg, and Jess's quiet sobs kept time to my suppressed gasps.

Having stalled as long as I could, I finally looked up past his perfect lips and met his twinkling eyes.
 A smile tugged at the corner of his mouth as he walked towards me, and it wasn't until he stopped and held out his hand that I realized it hadn't been empty this whole time.
 "Rachel said you needed some shoes."
 While I was still struggling to get thoughts to coalesce into words, Alec smoothly went down onto one knee, and picked up my left foot.
 The work of art he slipped onto my foot was so beautiful I felt bad letting it touch the ground.
 I held it up for a second, admiring the way the lights played off its gentle curves while I convinced myself nobody was going to throw me into jail for defiling it by using it for its intended function.
 Glass, or possibly something else perfectly transparent.
 It was hard to tell for sure what it was from so far away, but it wasn't plastic.
 The cool ovals where the sole had been cut away to reveal the material underneath told me that much.
 Whatever it was, it'd been created in layers.

The crash and thunder coming out of that old Sinclair station was music from the beginning of time, the music the apes heard which made them men.

 Buddy’s solos were like fluid silver; he was re-inventing the electric guitar.
 It was around this time that Buddy began writing songs.
 He was shy about it.
 No one knows how many he wrote before he brought the first one to the group, the one that would later be their most requested song, “I Love my Aunt Jemima.”  Soon, though, he was bringing in songs in coacervations, as if he had eons of them bubbling up.
 That first acceptance by the group opened the floodgates and Buddy Gardner became something of a songwriting machine.
 Other artists recorded many of his best things, a blessing, and he became a regular at Hi Studios, at Sun and later at Ardent.

Alec's shrug was enough to send my heart racing again, but not enough to distract me from his words.
 "With shape shifters, we believe it's because the animating energy, the soul if you will, burns more brightly than normal.
 I think it's tied in with what allows us to shift forms.
 With you, there isn't any obvious reason, but I think that Dominic has probably hit upon the root of the matter."
 His pause this time wasn't just to collect his thoughts; I could tell he was tempted not to tell me whatever he was thinking.
 "You know that our legends indicate a belief we were created in order to watch over and protect humans?
 Well, Dominic believes that your light represents a defense mechanism.
 We don't know of any accounts where humans have burned so brightly, but it's possible the primitive parts of you, the ones that remember what it was like to be watched over by our kind, hit upon a way to call for help from us, while not admitting a problem to your own kind."
 He was being so vague that it took me several seconds to follow the explanation to its logical conclusion.
 "So you're saying that I was, am, so broken I glow so your people would be able to pull me aside and fix me."

 While undue bloodshed can disqualify you, a single death during the tournament is not unusual.” While the Grand Marshal spoke, he did not look at the audience.
 He looked at Van’dret and he did not look happy at the interruption.
 “But clearly he already has a greater sigil; no man can fight like that who does not have one.
 He is an impostor.
 He steals this knighthood from more deserving squires,” Van’dret said.
 At this Rodregas saw many people nodding, but he remained silent.
 It was not his turn to answer any question other than from the Grand Marshal.
 The Marshal Faurrenida voice made his displeasure and his dislike of arguing with a non-knight clear as he said, “While a knight has the full right to enter both the Lesser and Greater Sigil Chambers and take and sigil as his level of magic might allow, it is not a sigil he earns today.
 It is knighthood.

His speed far beyond the guard’s, he knocked the stab away, then shifted his weight so that both Salvation and Condemnation blocked the other attack.

 Salvation took a throat.
 Condemnation pierced rib and lung.
 Harruq ripped his blade out of the guard’s chest and shoved the body to the side.

 He mocked them, adrenaline flooding his veins.

 The prospect of trying to catch up, all the while needing to master new material and deal with a full schedule of other classes, was too much.
 I felt tears rising to the surface even as my heartbeat sped up to near-panic attack levels.

In January 1994, the government embarked on a comprehensive monetary reconstruction programme to achieve price and exchange rate stability; to remove administrative controls over production, investment, prices, salaries, and interest rates; to re-establish the role of the central bank in monetary stability; to reorganize public finances through an efficient tax system, including more efficient tax collection and better coverage of the lage `grey' economy; to reduce government administrative and defence expenditure to the maximum possible extent; to maintain price supports for important agricultural commodities as an incentive for production; to stimulate economic activities of private, cooperative and public sector enterprises through equal access to credit and government facilities; and to encourage the takeover of sick firms by stronger, more efficient companies.
 At the same time, the programme was intended to mitigate the harsher effects of shock therapy programme was intended to mitigate the harsher effects of shock therapy programmes on the working class and fixed-income pensioners by providing free scope for collective bargaining, enforcement of a minimum wage policy and a social safety net for the unemployed.
 It was recognized from the outset that stability of the currency was an absolute precondition for the success of the reform programme, which depended in turn on the firmness and consistency with which it was implemented.
 The central element of the programme was the introduction of a new currency, the `superdinar', in parallel to the existing currency, but without demonetizing or confiscating it.
 Inspired by an experiment in the Soviet Union during the 1920s, the value of the new currency was tied to that of the Deutsche Mark and made fully convertible without restriction.
 Based on the country's very limited foreign currency reserves, new issues of the currency were to be utilized primarily to inject real purchasing power into the economy, revive demand and stimulate production, while covering the government's budget deficit during an initial six-month period needed for sufficient recovery.
 In this way the foreign currency and gold reserves were used as a buffer to moderate contraction of the money supply and avoid the shock usually accompanying such efforts.
 Issuing of the old dinar was stopped, but it remained in circulation as legal tender.
 An interest rate of six per cent was established for the superdinar - the first real, positive interest rate in years - to make holding the new currency an attractive alternative to hoarding goods or foreign exchange.
 It had been widely anticipated by foreign experts that this strategy would result in an immediate run on the country's foreign reserves and thereby a collapse of the new currency's foundation.

Agreements are needed to reduce production and severely restrict sales.
 Strong sanctions must be instituted to discourage states from actively or passively aiding or abetting small arms proliferation.
 The scope of the UN Conventional Arms Register should be expanded to cover small arms, but at the same time its provisions must be greatly strengthened in order to make this an effective mechanism.
 Reporting must be made mandatory rather than voluntary, and an independent surveillance system should be established to monitor compliance.
 The five permanent members of the Security Council, which together account for 80 per cent of the world’s arms sales, should also set up a system for mutual consultation on all large weapons orders.
 Mahatma Gandhi once explained that his efforts to suppress the natural aggressiveness of the people during India’s freedom struggle resulted in an explosion of violence between Hindus and Muslims when the country was partitioned.
 Today, in the absence of opportunities for venting aggression in global wars, pent-up energies are finding other outlets for expressing violence.
 The only possible way to manage these innate aggressive forces is to meet them firmly.
 The international community has already shown, in the case of airline hijacking, that it is capable of effective action on a global scale when the necessary political will and commitment are forthcoming.
 By concerted measures, the rapid proliferation of hijackings has been virtually eliminated.

“Okay.” “Steed is here.
 You can stay with him or go with me.” “I’ll stay.” I listened to her footsteps recede.
 When I was sure she was gone I slipped the book into my pack and hid it inside the material of the white gown.
 We would be leaving tomorrow, traveling to the peak.
 I laughed to myself—no matter how many times I said it, I had no clue what it meant.
 But now there was an urgency.
 No matter if it held safety, no matter if it held my family secrets, it held my escape from the bonds.
 It held my only chance.
 I hadn’t slept, and I knew I would have to sneak a nap in at some point, but I had priorities.
 It might be my last opportunity for a real bath.

I'd even missed Dad's favorite season, the one that'd become mine as well.
 It'd be all too easy to slip into the same kind of numbness now as a refuge against everything.
 What would happen if I failed to surface?
 It'd been easier to lapse into catatonia this time than last.
 Would I reach a point where I couldn't come back?
 There'd been a time right after the accident where Mom had thought I was already there.
 I was just numb enough still to think about such things without immediately collapsing.
 Even so, I felt a pang of dizziness as my mind warned me I'd pushed it too far today.
 I found myself in the kitchen, nearly finished making enchiladas with only vague ideas of why I'd started pulling ingredients out of the fridge.
 I wasn't hungry.

 “This is it,” Harruq said as he gestured about the small clearing he and Aurelia sparred in.
 “Where is she?” Qurrah asked.
 Harruq shrugged in response.
 “She’s never here.
 She always shows up after I do.”
 The smaller half-orc scanned the area, seeing no sign of the elf.
 “Perhaps she is not coming,” Qurrah offered.
 “You are late, after all.
 On the other hand, perhaps I scared her off.

 After a year, Pam returned to school.
 Two schools--Bethel Seminary for yet another Masters degree and U.C.
 Riverside for a PhD in Comparative Literature.
 And at those schools, when she met a new crowd of young folks just launching out toward their dreams, she wondered how much she had given up by marrying a fellow who already thought about retiring, which caused me to wonder in turn if I should I steel myself to prepare for another breakup?
 And should I make sure that if it came I wouldn’t again have to slog through the morass of missing my kid.
 Pam continued vacillating.
 One month she would talk about our child-to-be.

 Harruq arrived at the sparring point in the forest less disheveled than the previous day, and he seemed in better spirits.
 “So what is your surprise for me?” he asked.

“So what, a couple days?”
 “You know very well I can’t obtain any proficiency in such a short time,” she said.
 Harruq shrugged.

 “Two weeks,” she said.
 The elf danced away behind a tree.
 Harruq followed, but all he caught when he stepped around was a tiny line of blue fading on the afternoon wind.
 “That was interesting,” he said before returning to Woodhaven.

In the face of the near-universal apathy expressed by the rest of the student body, it took my mind several seconds to process exactly what had been said.
 I grabbed Brandon's arm and shook it to get his attention.
 "Did he just say they were drawing for free tickets?"
 Brandon looked slightly amused.
 Cassie, who I'd just interrupted, looked very much not amused.
 "I think so.
 I wasn't paying very close attention, but I think he did."
 The sound that came out of my mouth was disturbingly close to a squeal, but I was too excited to care.
 I waved goodbye as I stood and headed towards the doors.
 Amazingly enough, there was already a line in the office by the time I got there.

Low mandated prices for agricultural products have acted as a disincentive to producers.
 State control of farm support systems, including marketing, transportation and input supply, is highly bureaucratic, inefficient, and, often, corrupt.
 Overvalued exchange rates encourage the import of low-priced farm products, depress local farm incomes, and make exports uncompetitive.
 Underdeveloped infrastructure results in high transport and marketing costs.
 The slow rate of technological development and diffusion have slowed growth in agricultural productivity.
 Irrigation potential is underdeveloped and poorly managed.
 A major international commitment is needed to reverse the trends and end the famine threat in Africa.
 The region possesses considerable potential that could be converted into higher rates of growth.
 Africa has the world's largest reserve of arable land, one billion hectares, of which only 20 per cent is presently cultivated.
 Fertilizer use in sub-Saharan Africa is very low relative to other developing countries.

It's actually a relief to tell you.
 There are so many open secrets around here.
 It comes from living in such close quarters, from everyone being able to hear what's said anywhere in the house.
 It feels good to be able to share them with you."
 I returned his smile and tried not to focus on questions of just how much of the fluttering in my stomach was due to natural attraction for him, and how much was due to mystical heebie-jeebies.
 "For my part, I'm just glad you're telling me something for once instead of continuing to keep me in the dark."
 He released my chin and ran a finger down the side of my face.
 "Well, then I'm afraid I'll have to trade upon your current satisfaction to beg your leave.
 As much as I'd rather stay here and bask in your beauty, it's time for more training."
 I tried to keep the disappointment from my face, but his expression fell a little despite my best efforts.

We flew still farther as I watched the mountain pass below.
 There was a scrubby patch of trees ahead and I could see movement there, inside.
 I tried to focus on it… familiar silver and white.
 Commotion brought me back and I sat up, startled.
 My head spun.
 Ruby caught my arm to steady me.
 Her smile was strained as she handed me a drink of water.
 Chevelle was near the entrance of the stone room with Anvil and Grey.
 They appeared to be preparing to leave.

Qurrah leaned forward, clutching at his tormenter’s shaking hands.
 Words spilled from the half-orc’s mouth, garbled and nearly unintelligible.
 “What is it you wish to say to me?” the elf asked, ignoring the flailing hands that pawed at his face.
 “ _Hemorrhage,_ ” the half-orc hissed.
 The elf’s face exploded.
 Qurrah fell over onto his side, breathing as slowly as he could through the blood that filled his throat.
 The dead body of the elf crumpled in front of him, all of his hate-filled features gone from his face except for a single eye.
 The half-orc stared, wondering if his brother was truly dead.
 Darkness crept at the corner of his sight.
 His strength was fading fast, and he had little doubt that if he passed out he would never wake.

I'd spent way too much time with the pack to believe any of them had failed to notice Brandon's entrance.
 My gaze wandered back to where Vincent and Cassie were arrogantly walking through the door.
 Where Brandon had chosen a fairly traditional black tux, Vincent had selected a silvery masterpiece that probably cost only half as much as the former's outfit, but which practically screamed for attention.
 Cassie trailed along half a step behind Vincent, in a gray evening gown that was equal parts material and skin.
 Backless and strapless, combined with some fairly daring cutouts.
 She could probably have made a run for royalty if she hadn't topped the dress off with a scowl.
 She didn't look happy to be on Vincent's arm instead of pressed up against Brandon.
 Jasmin elbowed me in the ribs, distracting me before I could start in on whomever it was that happened to be following along behind Cassie.
 "Just ignore them.
 Even Brandon won't try anything with this many witnesses around.

"Like I said, I'll let you drive in a parking lot tomorrow.
 I'll pick up a booklet for you to study one day this week."
 She woke up so excited the next morning that she jumped into her clothes, ran through the garden, and was racing up the stairs less than ten minutes after she'd awakened.
 "Rick!"
 she called, running into her bedroom to get her bathrobe.
 "Rick, wake up!
 It's almost 8:00!"
 Rick groaned, wishing he'd told her that driving wasn't allowed before 10:00 a.m.
 He turned over and went back to sleep, but 15 minutes later, after her shower, she pounded on his door.

Despite my resolve, color rose to my cheeks once more as I turned away.
 I couldn’t understand why he was affecting me this way.
 The pages stuffed in my shirt felt like fire against my skin.
 I quickened my pace, caught my toe on a root, and stumbled.
 As soon as I righted myself, I wasn’t able to stop myself from peeking back to see if he had noticed, but he was gone.
 I didn’t know if I was relieved.
 My mind went over the encounter again as I made my way home.
 Did he always wear such a stern expression?
 Why was he looking at me so intensely?
 But I had my answer: Because you keep staring at him, fool.

Rachel's promise somehow seemed like it belonged from another time.
 The sincerity pulled me further out of my safe, numb shelter.
 Something in me wanted to confide in her, was willing to risk the pain of facing reality, but I was too far gone to be able to put what I was feeling into words.
 I shook my head again, not sure if it was a refusal or something else entirely.
 Rachel took it as the former and sat down next to me, pulling her knees up tight against her chest.
 A few seconds later I heard the howl of an after-market exhaust fed by a turbo-charged engine.
 The green Honda that came screaming through the parking lot was hardly recognizable as an Accord.
 It was approaching too quickly, but I couldn't bring myself to care.
 Besides, Rachel seemed unconcerned.
 Rachel helped me up as the car came to a screeching halt, all four tires locking up to slide it around so that the passenger side was facing us.

I should have known that Kojas would do anything to get him, and now Seth was gone.
 After he had been taken and Jason had awakened, the faery jerks had scattered.
 Then a light pixie had showed up, the same one who had saved my life a while ago, and led us all the way to her majesty’s place.
 She was apparently the queen but she was nothing like a stuck up royal leader.
 She was more like a warrior who lead Igneeria in the ‘good times.’ She was really nice but when we had met her, I was in an awful mood.
 No one blamed me; I had just watched one of my best friends get beat up and taken right before my eyes.
 Her Majesty said to return in the morning when I would hopefully be in a better mood.
 So Jason, Emily and I walked to her throne room.
 Emily pushed open the door and Queen Crystalla turned to us.
 She wasn’t someone who you’d expect to be named Crystalla.

The night is young.
 Taint the dreams of the slumbering.”
 Qurrah left Velixar to sit alone before the fire.
 The dark night sang a song of crickets and wind.
 In the quiet, Dieredon entered the light of the fire.
 “Greetings, traveler,” the elf said, bowing.
 “The town is not far, and all are welcome.
 Would you not sleep in safety rather than in the wild?”
 Velixar looked at the elf, dressed in camouflaged armor and holding his wicked bow.
 “You are a scoutmaster for the Quellan elves, are you not?” he asked.

His eyes were closed in concentration.
 He looked up at Rodregas with a confused expression and asked, “Do you know what this is?” “Not really, I found it in Raven Keep.
 It felt of magic so I took it.
 I thought it might be worth something.” Jordaan smiled and laughed as he said, “Worth something indeed.
 This is a minor Sigil of Healing.” It was Rodregas who gasped this time and said, “Infernals!
 We had a Sigil of Healing all this time?
 If we had inscribed this sigil back at the farm we would never have needed your help.” Jordaan nodded at the truth of Rodregas’ words and the two of them quickly gathered the others.
 All agreed that no matter what might happen with the greater sigils that all should gain the minor Sigil of Healing.
 Its benefits to warriors and mages alike were well known.
 Jordaan agreed to do the inscribing and show the others the technique.

In the 1950s, the Soviet Union managed to recover from the horrendous destruction it suffered during the Second World War and to embark on a period of rapid industrial growth without any external assistance.
 But today, without having passed through the ravages of war, the republics desperately seek foreign support and feel helpless without it.
 It is right that the world community should generously support the successful completion of the reform process in this region that is so vital for world peace.
 But it is also right that these countries should recognize the enormous untapped potentials which they possess – human, natural and productive – rather than be distracted by the prospect of a large influx of foreign capital.
 ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY IN YUGOSLAVIA
 The extreme damage wrought by the economic reform programme in these countries over the past half decade necessitates an urgent search for more viable alternatives, a search that has been retarded until now by the widely held view that none exists.
 Very recent events in Yugoslavia suggest that even in the limited area of economic stabilization and adjustment, an alternative strategy can be more successful.
 Although the long-term impact of the Yugoslav experiment is an yet unknown, its remarkably positive initial results merit serious consideration.
 The economic disorder that accompanied recent political developments in Yugoslavia resulted in an explosive increase in prices of more than 100 per cent per month in 1992.
 Despite efforts to control monetary expansion, hyperinflation exceeded three million per cent in 1993 - far higher than the inflation rate reached in Germany following the First World War and, quite probably, the highest rate in recorded history.

My cheeks tingled.
 I didn’t think I could feel my hands.
 “Attacked you,” he clarified.
 Something came out of my chest that sounded like a moan.
 I blinked, too slow.
 “Attacked?” “They must have tried to strengthen your bonds.” I knew I should have been shocked but I couldn’t produce the feeling.
 “They succeeded,” I complained.
 He nodded.
 “It seems it may have taken your magic completely this time.” This time.
 I concentrated on keeping my head straight, to look like I was listening properly, acting properly.

I wish there was some way I could repay you for everything.
 --Adriana Chapter 7 My alarm clock jerked me out of a thankfully dream-free slumber.
 Actually, as I pulled myself out of bed I realized I'd had a virtual torrent of dreams, but none of them had been possessed of the strange vividness that'd begun haunting my waking moments.
 I hadn't had one of the special dreams, ergo I hadn't had any dreams last night.
 I really needed to get out of this town before whatever was in the water drove me completely crazy.
 Actually, I probably didn't have much time in which to affect my escape.
 When it came to craziness I was already halfway there.
 After all, I'd already been diagnosed with the kind of clinical condition nobody with less than eight years of school could even pronounce.
 As amusing as my internal monologue was, I didn't let it slow my normal morning preparations.
 Almost before I knew it, I was downstairs and once again facing the dreaded decision of whether or not to eat breakfast.

The cut of his clothing hinted at designer origins, but the garment was mostly notable for the way it stretched over a pair of broad shoulders that looked like they'd been chiseled from marble, or possibly cast in bronze.
 My eyes made it as far as the equally impressive chest before I forced them upwards.
 Anyone built like that should be ugly to keep things in balance.
 Not him.
 His square jaw and even features were nothing less than perfection.
 If he ever chose to model, the editors of every major fashion magazine would have pulled out all the stops to land the contract for his debut appearance.
 The whole issue would have to be pictures of him though.
 No amount of airbrushing would suffice to allow other men to ever share the same magazine with him.
 I expected to begin hyperventilating any second, but my lungs seemed frozen.
 My body should have been screaming for oxygen.

Just use your magic.” I tamped down an image of the horse bursting into flames.
 “I haven’t learned animal magic.” His lip pursed, one brow dropping low, the same strange look he’d given the first time I’d mentioned learning magic.
 “Just feel it, Elfreda.” I ignored the slight annoyance that Chevelle must have told him my full name.
 “I don’t understand,” I told him.
 “You don’t learn magic,” Steed said.
 “It’s a part of you.
 Feel it.
 Think about what you want the horse to do.” My confusion must have still been evident.
 He shook his head.

“I am babysitting.” I stuck my tongue out at him.
 Tired, I settled back into my seat.
 “Steed, tell me about breeding horses.” He sighed.
 “How much detail do you want?” I giggled.
 He smiled as he started into the subject, explaining what he’d been taught about breeding techniques and dominant traits when he was young.
 His father had imparted to him all he had learned in his lifetime and all their ancestors had passed down before.
 They bred the animals methodically, striving to combine certain traits, bring them together in a single horse.
 With each generation, they strengthened the line, even bringing in new breeds from other lands to add to the list of desired attributes.
 Smoother gait, better endurance, stronger health, longer life.
 I faded off somewhere during the part about bloodlines.

This is not to say Rodregas did not spend most of his time dreaming that the handsome young Nymph would head back to his own estates.
 They were staying in a small village that seemed to be mostly a forest with small rooms built into it.
 Rodregas could not figure out any set pattern to the place or its boundaries.
 There might have been a dozen or even hundreds of Nymphs living there.
 Though all the Nymphs were friendly, he was still eager to leave.
 Jordaan was doing one of his mystic checks, running his hand a foot above Rodregas’ reclining body.
 Occasionally, his hand seemed to be moving in the air like a baker making bread.
 “Well,” Rodregas finally said, “I feel fine now and I thank you for your healing, but I think I am ready to leave.” Jordaan nodded.
 His face held his usual expression of good cheer.
 “Your body heals fast and is a fascinating medium to work with.” A cloud went over his smile when he added, “Your body and spirit were not in very good alignment and your connection to the world was terribly fractured.

I rose above, peering down at myself, and the image turned into my mother, the dark water going black, the ripples transforming to wind.
 I recognized the scene as her pendant began to glow, the wind howling, screams piercing my ears.
 It was the same dream, but different now.
 I glanced around to find a village I didn’t know.
 Someone was coming toward me, an expression of fear and sadness on his handsome face.
 His familiar face.
 He reached out to me and I stepped toward him, tears streaming down my cheeks.
 He wrapped his arms around me as I turned again to see my mother.
 A howl of rage escaped her and I started to go to her, but he held me.
 He was restraining me.

He had started to feel like he was faster and stronger than everyone else, and had not been expected the power of the blow.
 Rodregas went flying back down to the ground moaning.
 He rolled with it and came back up.
 Rodregas thought about the attacker and realized that here was one that would be a challenge.
 Judging by the distance his attacker kept and how he was clearly keeping his center of gravity low and balanced, Rodregas knew this opponent was a challenge.
 He was not just bigger and stronger; clearly he knew how to fight.
 A good fighter, of course, knows you do not let an opponent recover.
 His attacker came in hard and fast.
 Rodregas never saw the blow to his face, but luckily it was not a direct hit as Rodregas was already moving in close.
 Before the attacker could deliver another blow he was inside his opponents swing.

The rest of summer passed as the most joyful that he had known, as the three started to the Kata and the staff.
 After the staff they moved to the bow where Imeralda became the master.
 To use the magical Black Yew bows required learning a spell to merging with the bow.
 The spell was unlike anything Rodregas had learned.
 Imeralda said it was seldom taught to non-nymphs, though Ravenhurr had known the spell and taught a few of the guards with a touch of the talent.
 Using the bows was a matter of sending your innate power into the wood and singing with it.
 Not singing out loud, but making the power vibrate and move in a rhythm that matched the wood.
 When that magical rhythm was reached, the bow suddenly became almost fluid and moved nearly of its own volition.
 The arrows flew with incredible force and accuracy.
 The only problem was that the three could not practice freely as the arrows sometimes shattered on impact, as they flew with such force.

The posing of these two as opposite and mutually exclusive forces has for long limited our freedom of thought and action and prevented us from boldly experimenting with new ways to reconcile them.
 The peaceful termination of this confrontation has lowered the mental barriers.
 It provides us with an opportunity to synthesize these forces in a manner which balances individual freedom with collective action to eradicate the blatant manifestations of poverty, social injustice and inequity.
 Economic liberalism and rising investment in developing countries: One immediate result of this reconciliation has been the recent movement of economic liberalization spreading throughout the developing world, accompanied by the relaxation of bureaucratic constraints that impede growth.
 This trend has stimulated a dramatic increase in foreign investment in these countries, which has risen nearly six-fold during the past seven years.
 Private loans and foreign direct investment together are now approximately twice the level of total overseas development assistance.
 This investment provides additional benefit in the form of increased transfer of technology and management skills, increased access to export markets and a reduction in the cost of capital.
 Defence cuts: The monumental and extravagant waste of human, material, scientific and financial resources resulting from the preparation, execution and consequences of armed conflict are too staggering to quantify.
 In financial terms alone, direct expenditure on defence over the past decade was roughly equivalent to the value of the entire world’s gross annual product.
 The $400 billion reduction in global military expenditure achieved during the past seven years can be matched by a further saving of equal or greater magnitude, representing four times the current combined annual levels of foreign aid and international capital flows to developing countries.

They must be addressed with a view to evolving valid principles of international law, rather than remaining subject to frequent reversals of public policy by member states based on the short-term impact of the media on current public opinion.
 Granted that a consensus is reached regarding these larger issues of principle, there still will remain immense problems relating to implementation, as illustrated by the recent failure of international intervention in Somalia.
 Whatever may be the limits placed on the UN’s mandate for action, it is clear that it cannot carry out that mandate effectively under the current constraints imposed on it by member states through indecisiveness, narrowly defined interests and lack of political commitment.
 Once again the inherent weaknesses in the structure of the UN organization impact negatively on its capacity to perform the tasks rightfully allotted to it.
 The absence of a unified chain of command for national forces placed under UN command – culminating in the outright refusal of field forces to follow the commands of UN field staff, inadequate training and equipping of both military staff and fighting units, poor coordination between field units from different countries and between member states and UN headquarters – and a failure to vest sufficient authority in the UN Secretary General are among the most blatant weaknesses of the present system.
 Substantive measures are needed to strengthen the UN’s capabilities to handle crises.
 First and foremost, the position of the Secretary General, who now has the diplomatic status equal to that of a prime minister of a member state, should be upgraded to that of a head of state, with full authority over the forces placed under his command by member states to carry out the decisions of the Security Council.
 Problems of control over the armed forces of member states argue for the constitution of a standing international military force, as described in the previous section of this report.
 Lesser measures can be implemented immediately, such as provision of appropriate training to UN Secretariat personnel responsible for conflict prevention, expanding the staff of the Department of Political Affairs, and establishment by the UN of its own independent international surveillance capability, including a satellite system to monitor its work worldwide.
 Meanwhile, advanced computer, satellite and communications technology should be made available to the Secretariat by member states.

Those that were spared proved better able to sustain output and real incomes.
 Czechoslovakia had not suffered from inflation and was largely free of external debt.
 Hungary, which had decentralized its economy and had introduced significant elements of the market in production and investment before 1989, was not subject to the sudden shocks due to import liberalization and termination of planning.
 Lessons from the Reform
 The failure of the transition strategy to produce the anticipated results has given rise to extreme hardship, growing anxiety, frustration and anger within these countries.
 Internationally, it has generated intense debate about the reasons for the failure, the efficacy of ‘shock therapy’, and the appropriateness and adequacy of Western assistance.
 These questions reflect an inadequate understanding, both within and outside the region, of the stages and process and essential conditions for an effective transition under the circumstances prevalent in Eastern Europe at the time.
 Understanding of this failure holds the key not only to the rapid revitalization of the former Soviet and other Eastern European republics, but also to meeting the challenges of present and future transitions in Africa, Asia and the West.
 This understanding can be summarized in the form of several lessons that can be derived from the general experience of countries in the region.
 1.Multi-dimensional transitions cannot be brought about by uni-dimensional strategies: The economic dimension of transition cannot be viewed and acted upon in isolation from its political and social dimensions.

"Yes, mistress?
 Do you need something?"
 "Donovan, Alec said I could go watch them work out.
 Will you take me to wherever they are?"
 He dried his hands on a blisteringly white towel, and nodded.
 "Of course.
 I believe they are in the north end of the valley.
 Right this way."
 We made good time, even with Donovan's jerky, oftentimes painful gait, but the estate was even bigger than I'd realized.
 We walked for several minutes before rounding a corner and finding the entrance to a hedge maze.

"I'm sorry, sweetheart," he said, hugging her close.
 Tears rolled down her cheeks, and she choked back a sob.
 She missed her mother.
 She loved television and the microwave and blue jeans, but she wanted to exclaim over them with her mother.
 And she wanted to cuddle up next to Davis as they watched television together.
 Her father would buy them one.
 Well, if there were televisions in 1927, he would.
 Maybe she should see if she could carry one back.
 That thought made her chuckle.
 Rick drew back to look down at her.

“Ok,” he said, “time for an example.
 Imeralda stand tall,” Rodregas stated.
 She put her shoulders back, which caused her firm, rounded breast’s to thrust out.
 Rodregas didn’t think she meant the gesture to be sexual, but he hesitated at the sight of her superbly shaped body.
 Rodregas ignored his own rush of hormones and pushed her high on the shoulder and she stumbled back.
 “Now,” he said, “lower your center of gravity.
 Bend your legs, but keep them loose.” She followed his instructions, and he thought this would make her look less striking, but she went from a statuesque dancer to a crouching feline.
 He breathed in through his nose and tried to ignore his newly youthful hormones.
 This time when he pushed her shoulder she went back but did not stumble.
 “See, you stayed in control.

Over some months, through prayer and meditation, she came to believe that evil itself had invaded the world and entered people, and God had allowed this to happen, which led her to a certainty that we are now living in the world’s final days.
 Powered by these revelations, she prayed with intensity and perseverance.
 And God responded by urging her to give herself entirely to him.
 She assured him she was all his.
 For some weeks, he allowed her to rest on that answer, but more and more she became uneasy with it, until she realized she didn’t by any means belong entirely to God.
 Most of her thoughts, concerns and energies went to her family.
 She was the mom of three wonderful kids and the wife of a loving husband.
 In horror, she returned to intense and persistent prayer, telling God he couldn’t possibly mean she should leave her family, could he?
 Rather than reply with words, he used silence, like Tae Kwon Do Master Jeong used to do when one of us students offered an excuse for not training often enough.
 For weeks she waited, listened, and prayed God would at last reply that he had only been using the method through which he tested Abraham’s willingness to obey at any cost.

Chevelle was gone.
 “Are you well?” “Ugh.” He snickered.
 “Come on.” He swept me up, planning to carry me.
 My head spun.
 “No.
 Please let me walk.” “You do not tolerate that stuff well.
 You’re going to have to lay off the shimmer.” “It’s not like I chose to take it,” I complained.
 He laughed.
 The cold air helped a little.
 I was back in the circle, the group of us sitting around a small fire.

Feel it.
 Think about what you want the horse to do.” My confusion must have still been evident.
 He shook his head.
 “It’s like a muscle.
 You didn’t think about lifting your leg to get on the horse, you just knew you wanted to climb on and your leg lifted.” Chevelle caught us then, riding up and cutting off Steed’s explanation with a clipped, “This isn’t the time for a magic lesson.” All three horses slowed to a walk as Chevelle shot Steed a glance.
 I could only think of our lessons, of the fire in the clearing.
 It had been so obvious once Chevelle had urged me to control a stronger flame, I guessed because I had been using the power in small doses for so long.
 “What about your hands?” I asked.
 “What do you mean?” Steed said, ignoring Chevelle’s warning glance.
 “Why do you use your hands, if you just think it, I mean?” He laughed.

It was a loud smack.
 I was sure it had stung.
 Steed stood still, focused on the spot where Grey had landed and was flickering in and out of view.
 I made an effort to consider possible responses in my head, but was coming up blank.
 The nerves were gone.
 I found myself wanting Steed to win and leaned with his strikes, tensing as if they were my own.
 Grey bounded through the air once more, showing off, confident in his evident lead, and then a small rock rose at chest height in front of Steed.
 I was trying to figure out who had lifted it when Grey flashed back into view, hesitating only a moment as he considered the rock.
 At once, his face changed; he knew he’d been beaten.
 As he’d paused to study the floating rock, Steed had immobilized him and, just like that, the match was over.

Felewen stood beside her and faced the window.
 Her hair was tied in a long, black ponytail, her slender figure covered by rare chainmail crafted of the hardest metals known to the intelligent races.
 She had come from deep within Nellassar, the thriving capital of the Dezren elves, as just one of many that had arrived to protect the town.
 “Many are dying,” Felewen said.
 “The humans have a spellcaster of their own who repelled our ambush.”
 Aurelia nodded.
 She knew something had gone wrong; otherwise, the battle would have been over in seconds.
 “Very well,” Aurelia said.
 “Will you accompany me?”
 Felewen smiled at her.

"When you love someone, you should feel comfortable with him all the time.
 You should be able to put your arms around him whenever you want without having to fear rejection or disapproval.
 You should feel secure enough with him to know that no mistake you might make will make him stop loving you.
 And if he loves you, he should want to spend as much time as he can with you.
 He should cherish you, make you feel like you're everything to him, not just a part of his life with no more importance than any other part."
 Tears were rolling down her cheeks, and her mother took her hands, examining her eyes anxiously.
 "What happened to you, Marie?
 Did you run off with a man?"
 "No!
 I would never run off and leave you wondering what had happened to me."

Her expression of wonder made his old dried up heart smile.
 He was not sure how to feel, like a pleased father giving out mid-winter gifts to children, or like a young lover giving flowers to a new crush.
 Rodregas was unsure which reaction was proper now, and which she would want him to feel.
 Doi’van had watched the whole show with the thoughtful expression that he was starting to believe was his normal face to the world.
 “And do you have a full suit of Night Bronze Plate Mail for me and a magic sword or three as well?” he asked in his careful voice.
 “I am afraid that if we want any proper armor for ourselves we are going to have to take it off some Immortal Guard’s corpse.
 But I do have one other Black Yew bow and a bigger sword that probably makes more sense for you to use than me, since I have used nothing but short swords for a very long time.” Rodregas then pulled out the two-handed great sword that he had found at the keep and handed it to Doi’van.
 On Doi’van it was more a hand and a half sword, but as he flourished it around a bit, Rodregas could see he was pleased.
 “The steel is simple, but the balance is good.
 I am starting to be very happy that I helped pull this wagon up the hill,” he said with a deep chuckle, which sounded like distant thunder.

It’s like Lennon, you know—he was always a solo artist.
 That’s what I think anyway.
 I mean, in the middle of Beatlemania, when he had the fucking world by the tail, we thought, he’s singing “Help me if you can.”  And nobody was listening man.
 He was a squonk crying in the wilderness.
 God love him.
 I think he’s happier now, doing his own shit, not having to answer to anybody except John Lennon.
 That’s the way I am.
 I mean, I’m not claiming to be Lennon—Jesus, no—but, I was always a solo artist and in the straightjacket of a group I was itching to get to the good stuff, the stuff I cared about.
 It’s not worth grousing about, I mean, I had a good run in that group, but my solo albums are the only ones I care about.
 So, sophomore year, Debby is gone—well, I cut her loose, I’m not proud of it.

“Follow me,” Qurrah said.
 The two rushed past the elaborate elven homes toward the sound of combat.
 They kept to the back alleys, and because of this, they met their first target: three elves fleeing toward them, hoping to use the lesser-known pathways to avoid the overwhelming numbers of their opponent.
 “Bring them down,” the necromancer said.
 “With pleasure,” Harruq said.
 He raised his blades and charged.
 The closest elf realized the half-orc was an enemy and cried warning before rushing ahead, his longsword ready.
 “Come on, pansy-boy,” the half-orc warrior roared.
 The two collided in a brutal exchange of steel.
 The elf shoved his sword upward, using his forward momentum to slam the point straight at Harruq’s throat.

“They will die with little suffering,” the sorceress responded.
 “It’s the most I can give.”
 Electricity arced between her hands.
 Blue fire surrounded her eyes.
 The five human soldiers raised their shields and charged as a single unit.
 Felewen stood next to Aurelia, her sword high and her armor gleaming.
 She kept the blade out and pointed at the center soldier.
 When the bolt of lightning came shrieking out from Aurelia’s hands, that same soldier found himself lifted from the ground, his hands flailing, his useless sword and shield falling.
 The blue electricity entered through a second soldier’s body through his right eye.
 He died instantly.

 The dreams I had then were the most dreadful I’d ever had.
 I jolted awake and shuddered for several minutes at the images I could not beat down.
 Ruby was there, waiting for me.
 “Where are the others?” I asked, voice hoarse.
 “They’ve set up a perimeter.” It was all I had to say for the moment.

People from all walks of life, from all over the country and all ages; it was a mosaic of America’s addicts trying to change their lives.
 The longer the students were there, the more naturally they mentored the new arrivals.
 After about a half hour visiting the center, the facility had transformed for us— from a roadside dive motel to an oasis of healing.
 We took Brandon out to Thomas’s for Easter brunch, about an hour away.
 In that hour, a young man, our son, was in our vehicle and he spoke with confidence and newfound wisdom about what he was learning and how he was being taught to apply it to real life situations.
 At the brunch, the family watched as this same young man who was the subject of an intervention just a few months earlier, spoke calmly, listened to others and acted like a normal human being.
 We could not ignore this massive transformation in just two months as an inpatient.
 Lisa and I were thrilled.
 Giddy even.
 We drove Brandon back to the facility where they immediately drug tested him.

 Character 1- (jumps in surprise) ah yes, well, errr….my mother was a hippy back in the 60s and 70s, and she had a drug habit a mile wide.
 She was addicted to hard stuff by the time me and my sister were born.
 And she eventually passed on her addictions to us in one degree or another.
 Let me just say that being an asprin junkie at the age of 6 is a low point in my life, but I’m extremely proud to have beaten it.
 Well as a kid she used to scare my sister and me with horror stories about the Republican Party and conservatives in general, with the stories about rush Limbaugh being the worst of the lot.

Now our games were on Friday nights.
 Since Kenny’s mom didn’t care to deliver us for night games, and since we weren’t yet eighteen, she helped us secure border-crossing passes, which we liberally abused.
 Tijuana was wild and ugly.
 We saw fevered children out in the cold, begging on street-corners after midnight.
 I tripped over a dead fellow.
 In the bars, we saw girls get used by both men and farm animals.
 A few times we rode in taxis to motels where prostitutes greeted us.
 We would barter, object to the price, and leave while the coarser of them screeched obscenities.
 Some cabbies, after three or four such stops, stoically delivered us back downtown.
 Others pulled up beside a gang of thugs.

 “Fair enough.” “Okay then, see you two later.” Jason turned around with Seth on his heels.

 We still have the rest of the day.” I shoved the phone back in my pocket.
 “Hey, don’t take this personally, but we want to hang out alone.

 Seth unchained his bike and rode off with him.

I didn't suffer any real panic attacks, but more or less spent both days in a kind of despondency that wasn't much better than a full-blown attack.
 By the time Monday morning arrived I had vague memories of doing homework and not much else.
 The only positive from the whole weekend was the way my dream from Friday stayed with me.
 As I got ready for school I idly wondered if it would be possible to recreate the grotto in real life.
 Obviously not with the impossible, glowing water, but with the incredible, lush vegetation and the secluded pool.
 Then again, I'd seen Mom pull off some pretty crazy tricks with her camera, maybe there would be some way to simulate glowing water, some kind of photography trick I'd never heard of.
 I walked downstairs as the eastern sky was just starting to change colors.
 Mom was already gone.
 The message board was conspicuously empty, so she was either still frustrated with me, angry at our hopeless situation, or wrapped back up in her quest to become a renowned photographer.
 Britney picked me up on schedule and I somehow made it through my first two classes.

 They were atop him, but he dared not move.
 He sent a silent prayer to Celestia as more footfalls clomped all around him.

 Dieredon’s heart resumed.
 His breathing continued, slow and steady.

 As dire as his situation seemed, he could honestly say he had been in worse shape before and survived.

Our group glided up to the covered pavilion, surrounded in a pocket of silence as the rest of the crowd turned to see who'd just arrived.
 Alec produced tickets for all of us from a pocket somewhere while I was still taking in the sheer number of lights that'd been assembled for the occasion.
 The decorations inside the pavilion were amazing.
 Swathes of silk gave the open-air building an ethereal feel, while candles and other light sources created a soft illumination.
 I didn't have to possess preternatural hearing to catch whispers about the city having received a very large, very anonymous donation just a few days before.
 The committee had obviously chosen to spend it on decorations.
 My newfound height put me closer to Alec's ear.
 I only had to tug on his arm a little bit to get him down to where I could whisper to him.
 "That was you, wasn't it?"
 "What if it was?"

I’ll take you out to dinner tonight.” “You don’t have to do that.” “I bet you’d like to try out one of those buffets I told you about.” Her eyes widened.
 “A buffet?
 With lots of desserts?” He chuckled.
 “I know just the place.” Rick’s attentiveness calmed her, and she went to bed that night with a full stomach and an odd sense of security.
 Nothing about what had happened to her made sense, but Rick was right.
 If she had to walk out of 1927 into another time, she was fortunate she’d walked into his time.
 The week went by quickly.
 Marie always began the day with a walk in the garden, and Rick always hugged her and dried her tears when she returned.
 When he left for work, she'd exercise and watch movies he'd rented for her and clean the house with the supplies she'd discovered.
 In the evenings they'd eat and talk and watch TV, but he promised to take her to the shore Saturday.

Two contestants had already fought.
 The rules were simple.
 Two went in and one came out walking.
 The constants were bare of chest and foot.
 There were no fancy speeches to start the match, a bell sounded and the next round began.
 Rodregas kept his weight low and his hands up.
 Doi’van and he had discussed the best approach.
 Both agreed the best strategy would be to use his full strength and speed to be quick and as brutal as he could without killing.
 Doi’van suggested body blows were best, as a full strength a punch into the face would likely kill a normal human.
 The boy who faced him was fair haired and smiling, seeming to relish the match.

I stood up and walked over to Seth.
 He looked up from the ground and saw my troubled face.
 “What's wrong, Jazell?” “I need to speak to you,” I said in a low voice, “alone.” Seth nodded in understanding and I followed him out of the cave.
 We stood off to the side near the edge of the cliff where Emily and Jason couldn't see us.
 For a minute, I didn't say anything because I didn't know what to say.
 I hesitated, but knew that if I told anyone about the dream, it would be Seth.
 So what was the point in waiting?
 “I had a dream last night,” I began.
 “Only it wasn't really a dream, but more of a vision.” Seth nodded.
 “What was it about?” I told him about the cliff and how Kojas had killed the dwarf.

It had never burnt me or any other elf as far as I knew; it would only burn what it was meant to burn.
 I glanced back down at the scroll, realizing the fire magic had been meant to burn.
 I should never have read the words aloud.
 I carefully picked it up and rolled it back in place, certain I would never read from it again.
 Binding the pouch as I had found it, I tucked it into the pack.
 When I checked my hands to decipher the lines, I realized I was seeing a map.
 Yes, it was burned into my palms, but it was a map.
 I couldn’t fathom why anyone would have a ridiculous spell like that, and then it struck me that it had come from the vault, from my own family’s things.
 I bit down hard on my lip, fighting the impulsive urge that always got me into trouble.
 But I didn’t want to go back to the village, not ever.

I leaned onto the sink and glared at the mirror, where my flesh appeared to peel and shred.
 I kicked the wall and howled.
 A teacher came rushing in.
 He was a large Spaniard who had given me plenty of office referrals for failing to shave or wearing a shirt with tails out.
 This time, when he ordered me to the office, I blasted him with a volley of curses that might have convinced him he should send me to an exorcist rather than to the front office.
 Then I dodged him and hustled back out to where Cliff and Billy leaned against the office wall, surrounded by tragedy groupies.
 The three of us escaped around the office building, down the front steps to the street, where we ran into Laura.
 Though in four years she would become my wife, I hardly knew her and didn’t realize yesterday was her birthday.
 She asked me to sit on the grass for a minute.
 Staring across the ball fields, she said, “Just last week he promised that for my birthday he was going to give me a very special present, only I wouldn’t understand it for a long, long time.

The tension ratcheted up in step with the rolling waves of energy, as Brandon and Vincent drew nearer.
 They split up when they saw us, casually positioning themselves so Alec couldn't protect me from both of them.
 I felt my knees stop working as I took in Brandon's lazy, confident smile, and Vincent's sick, eager expression, but the gentle pressure of Alec's grasp on my hand kept me from falling down.
 I looked up at Alec, hoping for a reassuring smile, but his face had taken on the expressionless mask he used to guard his thoughts.
 I tried to slow down, but Alec kept moving forward, never altering his speed in the slightest as he pulled me directly towards Vincent.
 It seemed incredible that the few other people still in the hall couldn't feel the surge of energy as Vincent stepped directly in front of us and placed his hand on Alec's chest.
 The sudden spike was enough to make my hair stand on end, but Jim Hansen hurried by without any indication there was something out of the ordinary.
 "You're in our way, half-breed."
 I felt Alec's grasp tighten slightly, but considering the crushing strength he was capable of, it was the closest thing imaginable to a non-response.
 Brandon was coming up behind Vincent, as Alec reached up and placed his own hand on Vincent's chest, with another, stronger flash of power.

The orc roared in victory only to die as a soldier shoved his sword in his side and out his back.
 “Will they make it through?” Harruq asked, in awe of the display.
 Qurrah glanced over the wall and then back to the main combat.
 Archers continued eviscerating the orc forces.
 If they could push into the city, their arrows would be a nuisance at best, but it seemed they had underestimated the human soldiers.
 “They are running out of time,” Qurrah said.
 “But they might.”
 He glanced back to the necromancer, and then he saw his eyes, just hints of red underneath the hood of his robes.
 Qurrah shivered as whispers shot up his spine.
 _You silenced my pets,_ it said.

"I don't believe you.
 At least not the part about it not being anything to worry about.
 You all wouldn't have been so worried about Alec bringing me home Friday night if this was all no big deal.
 None of you have argued with Alec about anything since then, but Friday night James, Jasmin and Jessica were all ready to rip my head off over his express orders."
 The nod I received this time was even slower than the first.
 I waited for Isaac to say something, but he seemed unwilling to give away anything I hadn't already figured out for myself.
 "Can he win?
 Alec, I mean.
 Can he ki...beat Brandon?"
 Isaac's sigh was eloquent.

I was so very proud of him.
 One evening, less than a year later, Brandon cancelled a night out with his friends, including Tom.
 He didn't feel like going out.
 His wheelchair-bound friend went anyway.
 The phone rang late that night with the unbelievable news of another car accident.
 This time Tom’s paralyzed body was thrown through the window and he tumbled down the highway to his death.
 Brandon was inconsolable.
 His best friend was dead.
 Brandon blamed himself for not being there to take care of Tom.
 One of Brandon’s confessions during rehab was that almost all of his friends decided to get as high as they could to attend Tom’s funeral.

This view leaves two questions unanswered.
 First, if the market is so effective, why is it that every major capitalist economy utilizes such a vast array of subsidies, incentives, controls, production quotas and fixed pricing mechanisms to govern production and trade in agricultural products?
 Even after GATT, protection for this sector by industrial nations will remain high.
 Second, granted that the market works effectively for mature capitalist societies with high levels of technology, education, productivity, living standards and food surpluses, and relatively small portions of the workforce dependent on agriculture, is the same necessarily true for countries at an earlier stage of development, in which (1) a majority of the workforce is dependent on agriculture for sustenance, (2) levels of education, productivity and incomes are low, and (3) any increase in food prices can have a devastating impact on food consumption levels in the country?
 The answers to these questions are relevant both to the countries presently making the transition from centrally planned to market economies in Eastern Europe and to poorer developing countries striving to achieve food security.
 Nations accord special status to their agricultural sector for several reasons.
 Continuous supplies of food are absolutely essential to the welfare of the population.
 Food prices are extremely sensitive to changes in the supply of foodstuffs.
 Even a small increase or decrease in supply can lead to a very wide fluctuation in prices.
 A bumper harvest can depress prices to the point of bankrupting large numbers of farmers.

As my horse knelt, he held out his hand and I stepped down beside him.
 The three stallions followed Steed to a nearby tree where he fed them small green-skinned apples from its branches.
 I glanced back to Chevelle.
 He was watching me.
 I wanted to ask if this was where he was from, but was afraid to set off any conversation that might end with me being hauled back to council that much quicker.
 I looked again out over the lake to the mountains.
 If I was incarcerated for a thousand years in the village, I would want this memory.
 I breathed deep; the air was cool, moist, and smelled so unlike the harsh floral scents that saturated every part of the village.
 I could sense the deep green moss covering the rocks at my feet, the fir trees that edged the east bank.
 Even the soil smelled richer.

Deeper in the forest, Aurelia stepped out of a glowing blue portal.
 An elf waited there, an ornate bow slung across his back.
 “So do you think it could be him?” he asked her.
 “Perhaps,” Aurelia said.
 “I think it’s in him.
 Something is wrong, though.
 He’s too light hearted, too free.”
 “What does that mean?” the other elf asked, his fingers twitching at the string of his bow.
 “I don’t know, Dieredon.” Aurelia sighed.
 “It means he’s capable, but would not do so without reason.

The dark fire already burned.
 He saw the face of his master, and the sick grin there horrified him.
 “I will not die!” he shrieked.
 “I will not die!”
 His flesh burned in fire, his bones blew away as dust on the wind, and only an empty robe remained of the being that was Velixar.
 Yet, still haunting the wind, was his final cry, a promise to the world of Dezrel.
 _“I will not die!”_

I told him that he had told me he didn’t want to know anything, and I preferred to keep it that way for now.
 I did give Officer White enough information so he was sure I had the right people.
 I just needed to know when and where the narcotics squad wanted to do this deal and what I needed to do next.
 The Officer was excited at the opportunity to get this guy and he arranged me coming to the police station so I could make the call to set up the one hundred Oxy pill deal on a recorded phone line.
 The drug deal itself would happen later and I would need to be evasive and the where and the when as to the actual exchange of money for drugs.
 I was told to call her from my phone and tell her I would call her tomorrow around noon.
 Chapter 18: Game Time I arrived at the station and was escorted to an interrogation room.
 It looked like a carbon copy of the room I was in before but it was further down the hall.
 Officer White connected a recording device to my crack-berry and I was told to place the call and get Ashley to engage in conversation that would be incriminating.
 I was to get her to use the word “Oxy” and discuss the price and the quantity and to get Ashley to acknowledge that the price was “$2500 cash for the one hundred Oxys.” I placed the call, nervous and anxious to be sure to get what the police wanted.

 "What about Father?"
 "I met him two years after I lost Andrew.
 Your father is a good man, Marie.
 He doesn't have the passion or sweetness Andrew had, but I do love him.
 And he gave me you and John, so I'd certainly never regret having married him."
 "But you've never loved him like you did Andrew."
 "There are different types of love."
 "But you understand when I say that I don't want anyone else, that I could never love any other man the way I love Rick and that I don't want to settle for anything less."

Harruq whirled on him, a quick double strike knocking the sword from his hand.
 Helpless, the man staggered backward, clutching his wounded side.
 His eyes pleaded, but his mouth would dare not say the demeaning words.
 Harruq cut him again and again.
 His arms, his chest, his face: it all bled.
 But he remained alive, at least until that final moment when the two magic blades scissor-cut his neck.
 Harruq sheathed his swords and held the decapitated head of his foe high above him.
 Full of pride, Qurrah watched his brother roar his victory to the night sky.

"It's too important for that."
 He took her hand, gazing into her eyes as he raised it to his lips.
 "Let's go inside."
 They sat down on the sofa, and Rick held both her hands in his as he faced her.
 "I love you, Marie.
 I love you more than I've ever loved anyone in my life.
 I want-I want to spend the rest of my life with you."
 He released her hands to reach into his pocket for a small box.
 Opening it, he took out a diamond ring.
 Marie gasped, staring at the ring.

He leapt into a rear window and I followed as low and slow as I could.
 When I reached the last tree I could use for cover, I darted up against the hut and peered through a gap in the twigs that patched it together.
 They were whispering.
 “… mustn’t let them find you… shouldn’t have come…” It was dim inside, but I caught a glimpse of a figure through the wall.
 Junnie.
 Chevelle was whispering his reply to her, and though I couldn’t quite hear, he must have given her a short account of the morning’s events.
 I moved closer to the window, finding a larger gap there.
 “Were you able to track her?” Junnie asked in a low voice.
 “Not exactly.
 She’s following me.” Heat flooded my face.

 Harruq sighed and looked away.
 He gently tapped his swords together.
 “I don’t know.
 Bored.”
 “Am I not a challenge?”

It was obvious we were on the wrong track here.
 "What about some other mechanism?
 One that wouldn't just make water glow with a dancing gold light, but plants too.
 Do you know of anything like that?"
 I heard something snap off to my right, but I was too busy blushing from the chorus of giggles coming from the front of the classroom.
 Even Mrs. Alexander had an amused smile on her kind face.
 "While there are certain types of vegetation that do indeed glow, I'm afraid I don't know of any natural phenomenon that would create the kind of effect you're referring to.
 Such a thing is still the provenance of science fiction writers."
 I knew I'd gotten a little carried away.
 The prime rule of high school survival involved avoiding situations people could use to ridicule you later, but I'd really wanted a rational explanation for my dreams.

She made her way to this very village and happened across my father, poor unsuspecting sap.” Ruby flitted her fingers, glasses and wine served before each of us as she continued.
 “So there he was and she, just a wisp of a woman, flew up to him and blew a little fairy dust… well, you know about that.” I narrowed my eyes at her.
 Ruby grinned.
 “He was putty in her hands.
 It was all over before he even knew her purpose.
 She kept him under her enchantments and lies as long as she could.
 She thought she was safe hiding here in the village but, as you know, an elf birth is a hefty event.
 Upon the hour of my birth, the entire village had gathered to see the new elf—at my father’s request, of course.
 Can you imagine the shock when they found my mother was his intended?” She laughed, but her audience was quiet.
 Chevelle, expression uncomfortable, turned to watch out the front window.

 Why the year 2011?” Her questions made him reflect uncomfortably.
 The fact that he’d read an article about her just days before she’d appeared couldn’t be a coincidence.
 He couldn’t begin to explain the how or the why, but the when made sense.
 He knew what her future was going to be, so maybe he could help change it.
 But he didn’t know if it was a good idea to tell her that right now.
 As soon as she went to bed, he’d get the article out and reread it.

The march of humanity is marked by the development of larger-scale, more complex and more efficient types of organizations to serve higher and wider social needs.
 Advances in the technology of organization, as much as advances in the technology of production, have been responsible for global progress during the present century and, especially, during the post-war period.
 We have argued earlier that establishment of effective and lasting peace requires a radical restructuring of the existing institutions for global governance.
 Unless and until the UN comes to embody in its own functioning the principles of representative democracy, it cannot hope to play a leading role in maintaining peace and freedom in the world.
 As government and political leaders know only too well, an organization with responsibility but without authority is doomed to failure.
 Unless UN member states invest international institutions with the necessary authority and meet their financial commitments to support them, the world will continue to drift and flounder, powerless to oppose petty dictators and ruthless aggression.
 Unless a cooperative world military force comes into existence, every country will continue to be burdened with the enormous expense and insecurity characteristic of the old system.
 Perhaps more than any other institution, the military has under stood and demonstrated the enormous power of organization to accomplish a goal.
 The Gulf War was a dramatic illustration of the importance of reliable information, perfect planning, logistical support systems, effective chains of command and swift responsiveness to changing situations.
 If humankind could mobilize and apply the same efficiency to the war on poverty and unemployment that it has exhibited in preparing for and waging military wars against each other, very soon there would be no more poverty or unemployment to fight.

Too many thoughts are packed in my head as I realize this is my life and my family’s life passing before me as the moment of truth approaches.
 Perhaps all this worrying is for nothing or perhaps the worst is about to happen.
 I must cleanse my mind of this sudden bombardment of thoughts and I must focus!
 I pull into the parking lot of the Starbucks just as my crack-berry rings.
 I see Ashley standing inside the coffee shop with her cell phone up to her ear.
 I answer the phone as I notice a space directly facing the front door of Starbucks is opening up as a car begins to back out.
 She asks me where I am and I tell her I am looking at her from in the truck waiting for that front spot to open.
 She sees me, and as we talk I can see her lips move slightly ahead of the sound of her voice.
 I didn’t see the red Dodge Charger anywhere when I was pulling in and I don’t see it now.
 I scan the people around Ashley as I am pulling forward but Steve, the young man in the surveillance photo, the boyfriend and drug dealer is nowhere to be seen.

7.A greater degree of regional cooperation is desirable between states which share natural resources and common environmental interests.
 This is of particular importance where regional peace and stability is at stake, as in the Middle East, over the question of access to water supplies.
 Where national environmental resources may lead to dispute and conflict, agreements should be drawn up between potential belligerents and the good offices of the UN's specialized agencies used to anticipate and avert future conflict.
 Peace and democracy can provide only the foundation for stable and productive social life, not its fulfilment.
 For that, political security has to be complemented by economic security and a blossoming of individual and cultural potentials.
 Yet here our optimism seems to flag.
 Our thoughts of the new millennium do evoke images of greater peace and stability internationally, more individual freedom and democratic rights, growing international co-operation, exciting new technologies, increasing cultural interaction.
 But they also evoke images of more people and less work – meaning fewer jobs!
 No sooner has the threat of nuclear annihilation receded, than the spectre of chronic unemployment and unrelenting poverty has risen to replace it, giving renewed justification to humanity’s deepest anxieties by transferring them to a new source of apprehension.
 In recent years, unemployment has emerged as a major cause of concern for governments around the world.

 Qurrah lurched awake, gasping for air.
 His throat ached, and he could feel the tiniest trickle of blood down his trachea.
 The night was still deep and the town quiet.
 Beside him, Harruq snored loud enough to wake the drunkest of men.
 Far away, a wolf howl beckoned.
 “Sleep well,” Qurrah said, leaving the town.
 His doubt faded with each step.
 All was identical to his dreams.
 A mile from town, he saw the hill, a smoldering fire atop it to guide his way.

 I opened my mouth to interrupt, but my vocal chords weren't working.
 Now that she'd finally broached the subject, Britney was unstoppable.
 "It had to have been a mountain lion, there isn't anything else around here that's both aggressive and big enough to kill people, but neither of them had been gnawed on at all, which was strange enough by itself.
 Everyone refusing to talk about it would've been enough to make it X-Files weird, but when the coroner threw such a fit, it entered a class of its own."
 Britney looked around again to make sure nobody was in hearing range, and then leaned in even closer.
 "He said the wounds weren't made by anything in the cat family.
 He wrote up a whole paper on how the teeth marks were made by some kind of new, previously undiscovered predator."

 When we get to the peak, we can trade.
 It is the strangest thing; they herd the animals to town and then corral them to eat at their leisure.” She shook her head at the absurdity.
 “But you haven’t eaten until you’ve tasted a fattened beast.” “The peak?” Concerned, she asked, “You don’t know where we’re going?” I drew a breath, uncertain how to answer.
 I would have been sure not to trust her, but she was traveling with us.
 It was probably best not to tell her, of all people, that I had no clue where I was or where I was going.
 I needed to stay on this path, now more than ever.
 Chevelle’s words rolled through my mind.

I was afraid to scare him too much, so I decided on a small gesture.
 I held my hand out in front of me, emphasizing the action as I twisted my wrist in the air, the boar’s head spinning, the sound of its neck cracking in tandem with my movement.
 He gasped and stepped back from me.
 I was afraid for a moment I’d shown him too much.
 He looked at my face, searching, and finally let out a breathless, “Magic.” His face was filled with wonder.
 I had seen many impressed with my talents, but never with such an effortless show.
 I laughed to myself.
 It was refreshing to have someone so genuinely awed.
 He didn’t ask to see what else I could do; he wasn’t sizing me up for battle.
 I smiled at him and he seemed to think that alone a reward.

 “Discard your swords, Harruq,” Velixar said.
 “You are the protector of my disciple.
 You deserve better.”
 He slid his two swords out from their sheaths, stunned by the ease in which he moved them.
 It was if they went from being made of steel to air.
 He tossed them aside.
 Velixar pulled from within his cloak a chest the size of a small stone.
 He placed it on the grass where it shone gold in the light of the stars.
 As the two brothers watched, he whispered a few words of magic, enlarging the chest to normal size.

 Before he could pull the cork off the top, he heard a voice speak.
 “So many dead by your hands yet a single arrow nearly takes your life?”
 The half-orc froze, the vial clutched in his hands.
 An elf emerged from behind the building, his body decorated in a brilliant green cloak and silvery armor.
 It was the same elf who had fired the first warning shot to Antonil before the entire battle had begun.
 “I am but a poor outcast,” Qurrah said, hiding the handle of the whip underneath the palm of his hand.
 The coiled leather vibrated, hungering for blood.
 “Do not lie to me.
 I have watched you two slaughter my brethren.

 The hope felt juvenile and ignorant but she clung to it tightly.
 The magic left her fingertips, and doing her best to calm her heart, she followed Harruq back home.
 “Nothing?” Qurrah asked when Harruq stepped inside.
 “Nothing.”
 It seemed Qurrah would leave it at that, but he clearly saw the apprehension on his brother’s face.

 And he wasn't nearly as handsome as Rick.
 Rick had beautiful blue eyes and-and a broad, muscular chest that she got to see every morning if she woke up before he did.
 In her dreams, he never had on a shirt, and he was always smiling.
 That dream might change now.
 Right now the image in her mind was of his face as it had come closer and closer to hers.
 She'd wanted him to kiss her.

 As Felewen lay upon the ice, a soldier stabbed down at her.
 She spun on her rear, her sword out in an arc.
 After knocking him off his feet, Felewen snapped her legs high above her, spinning her body off the ground.
 She landed on her stomach, her sword skewering the guard’s innards.
 She pulled herself to her feet with the hilt of her sword, twisted the blade, and then finished him.
 The remaining soldiers turned to flee, but there was one slight problem.

She's got an incredible temper though."
 "She's dating Alec right?"
 Britney nodded emphatically.
 "I've never seen them kiss or hold hands, but they've got to be.
 She's totally rebuffed everyone, and he's never evidenced even the slightest interest in any other girl.
 Plus, they're like the two hottest people in the entire school.
 How could they possibly date anyone else?"
 It was hard to argue with that.
 Jasmin was the kind of brunette who disproved the old saying that gentlemen prefer blondes.
 Any guy with a pulse would want her.

His head pounded, and the pull on his chest was so great he felt he might pitch over the wall to his death.
 Qurrah’s well of magic drained at frightening speed.
 He almost let go, but he thought of his brother, shaking under the spell of the skulls.
 _No,_ he thought.
 _Enough.
 Cease your chatter._
 He clutched tighter, the threads braiding into a giant rope in his mind.
 High above, the skulls quieted, and their fires dimmed.
 When the necromancer noticed Qurrah’s meddling, his mental link pulsed with incredible energy.
 Colors swarmed through his mind, dark purples and reds across a macabre canvas of black.

The only effective evangelist I encountered in those days was Tony Tarantino, a lanky Jesus freak with frizzy red hair and an expression both bewildered and wise.
 I picked him up hitchhiking.
 He settled into the seat, set his Bible on his lap, stared at me for a minute and asked, “Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?” “Yep,” I said, and readied myself to field the standard subsequent questions.
 Tony said, “Oh.
 Good.” A week later, he was leading a Bible study at our house.
 Cliff’s not much of a talker.
 I believe nobody heard his stories from Vietnam until years afterward.
 I don’t pry, so I can’t be sure what goes on inside him, but I have no reason to think he believes in God, or that he doesn’t.
 But whether he believes or not, Cliff has gotten well blessed since our evening with Billy Graham.
 He has four wonderful kids, and Toni, who is one of those rarest of people who appear to grow brighter, stronger, and more beautiful every year.

She continued to shoot us nasty looks throughout the class, but I hardly noticed.
 Alec spent the rest of the class time writing questions for me in the margins of my notebook.
 By the time I'd described my grandparents, kindergarten teacher, and top three most embarrassing moments, I wanted to get a chance to ask some questions of my own, but he just shook his head and passed me my notebook back with a new set of quickly-jotted queries.
 The sentences should have been a careless mess based on the speed with which he was writing.
 Instead they turned out more even and carefully constructed than anything I'd ever been able to accomplish.
 I'm the Alpha here; you can ask your questions when I finish with mine.
 The flippant, humorous nature of his response was so atypical, and yet still quintessentially Alec.
 I nearly broke into a fit of laughter that would've gotten us both in even more trouble with Mrs. Sorenson.
 I roll my eyes at you...a lot.
 So once you're done, I get to ask you any question?

It really was beautiful; I looked back up to thank him again when a wave of weakness slid through me.
 Alec caught me before I hit the ground.
 "Are you ok?"
 "I think so.
 I thought I was past all of this recovery stuff."
 He looked concerned but I'd learned to read his expressions better than I think he realized.
 He was worried, but not just about me.
 He spent a lot of time worrying.
 The rest of the pack, the town, his mother, his sister.
 It was a lot for someone our age to deal with.

“Let’s get to shelter before dark.” As he headed into the hidden hollow the orchard became clear.
 He was sure that at one point it had straight rows and a pattern to it.
 But the orchard had been wild for a very long time.
 While there was a bunch of fruit trees and berry bushes, most were the descendants of the original orchard and it was hard to find anything that reassembled a straight row.
 The apples trees were in fruit and they all started grabbing a few of each to eat as they went.
 Rodregas was not much of a farmer and did not know what the different types were named, but he liked the small green ones with the yellow splotches; they were sweet with a wonderful tang.
 “You know,” said Doi’van, “Hiding on a ley line definitely makes sense for keeping the Immortalists off our back and these apples are delicious.” Rodregas stared at him as he ate.
 Humans ate around the core, but Doi’van was eating the whole apple as he talked.
 “And I love the feel of all the magic.
 My body was meant to live in a place that has more magic than our world does, but the lines are chaotic.

My head was still spinning as she leaned down and hissed into my ear.
 "Get out of here.
 Don't wait around, don't ask anyone for a ride.
 You had your chance and you blew it.
 He's mine again, and if you're not out of sight in the next five minutes I'll kill you myself and end this stupid experiment once and for all."
 I'd only heard that kind of blatant willingness to kill once before, and just like with Jasmin, I was absolutely convinced Cassie was serious.
 I wanted to get up, to do something other than just lie shaking on the rocks, but my mind was like an appliance with stripped gears.
 It was spinning but not grabbing onto anything, so nothing was happening.
 Cassie picked me up with one hand and gave me a hard shove back towards the road.
 I almost fell.

There was no mention at all of her death--or of her marriage.
 The only information was her date of birth, the names of her parents and brother, and the general family history.
 He knew that the other information had been there before, and after his mind had completely rejected the impossible--that the print had changed when Marie had stepped from 1927 into 2011 (another impossibility)--he rapidly considered the implications of such an impossibility.
 Maybe the information about the rest of her life wouldn't appear until she returned.
 And maybe she wouldn’t marry Davis when she returned.
 What she did here might have an impact on how her life progressed in the past.
 Rick closed his eyes.
 He wasn't used to theoretical reasoning.
 But there was one thing he was sure of: that sweet girl asleep in the next bedroom wasn't going to return to a life of misery if he could help it.

Eric possessed by Jesus, I can adore.
 I still see him.
 I can watch the lines of his face change as I tell him about my fears or longings.
 I can hear him speak thoughtful words.
 Fear v. Love
 While speeding on Interstate 5 north out of Sacramento past orchards and pastures, with long miles between the small towns, I think back to my talk with Toni, the part about suffering from panic attacks.
 During five of those hard years, while I taught in Chico, I often drove this highway to visit writer friends in San Francisco.
 This part of I-5 terrified me, with visions of a sudden attack that would deny me control over my mind or body, leaving me helpless and miles from the closest nurse or doctor.
 For no good reason except the fear of fear, my heart would race, my lungs and throat constrict, my hands become slick with sweat.
 I couldn’t run because I couldn’t breathe.

 Harruq lowered his eyes in shame.

 “I…‌I’ve been training with someone.”
 Qurrah crossed his arms.

“Home, Freya.
 Run.” I didn’t hesitate, I sprinted straight home without looking back.
 The house seemed empty but I didn’t check.
 Heart pounding, I went directly to my room and closed the door behind me.
 The single flame still flickered above my bedside table, and as I walked closer, I noticed a package on my bed.
 I spun my hand and lit the room to better see.
 It was a large ivory box tied with tweed.
 There was a small note under the knot.
 Dearest Elfreda, I must away without saying goodbye.

I felt my skin heat up again, but managed to stick my tongue out.
 "No, we're not quite there yet, but before we continue on, I need your promise not to discuss this with anyone.
 Not even the rest of the pack."
 I was taken aback with his sudden intensity, and part of me wanted to bristle at the implication I couldn't be trusted with a secret.
 His expression softened a little as he reached into the small bag mounted on the fuel tank, and handed me a bottle of water.
 I hadn't even realized I was thirsty until that second.
 "I'm sorry, Adriana.
 I know I can depend on you, this is just important enough that I needed to make sure you understood what's riding on your discretion."
 I finished with the first third of the bottle, and then nodded.

"I've been running letters back and forth between the two of them since I was ten.
 I don't come out here very much, but I make the trip as often as it's safe to do so.
 They both live for those letters."
 We walked in silence for several more seconds before I got the nerve up to verify my interpretation of what I'd just seen.
 "She was just looking inside you to see if you've developed a power yet, wasn't she?"
 Alec helped me over an especially daunting rock and then nodded.
 "And nothing has changed.
 She's been telling me for years now that I have the potential to develop a fairly spectacular gift, one that should it choose to manifest in a useful form, could be more than a match for Brandon's strength.
 Apparently I'm still right on the point of developing said gift, only our time has run out.

I grabbed my pack, pretending to get ready, and sighed when I felt it tucked inside.
 I didn’t remember doing it, but I was grateful I had.
 I was really getting into the story.
 I yawned and stretched, and then followed her out of the room.
 I was surprised at the size of the fort.
 We went down several corridors and passed a few doors before finally coming to a large, open arena where the others waited for us.
 Chevelle smiled at me as I passed him on the way to my horse.
 I started to command the horse to kneel, but then Steed grabbed me at the waist and threw me up.
 I took one deep breath before we kicked the horses into a gallop and ran from the fort in a pack.
 Our pace finally slowed as the way became too treacherous.

Maybe it really said all of those things, or maybe I was completely deluded, but it was definitely a smile.
 That alone was enough to make my heart skip a beat, and send a warm tingly feeling lapping through me like a wave of distilled happiness.
 I was halfway through History before I realized there'd been something odd about the discussion at Brandon's table.
 Luckily, Mr. Simms started out the class in usual form.
 It was virtually guaranteed we wouldn't learn anything which was fortunate or I might have missed something.
 Once my mind latched on the question of what had been different than normal, I didn't hear a word anyone else said.
 It wasn't until I was back at my locker and midway between switching out my History book for my Physics notes that I finally realized what it was.
 Normal juniors didn't sit at a lunch table and figure out what to do about anything.
 They complained, they gossiped, they boasted about what they were going to do, but it was all just an exercise designed to reinforce the social order.
 I'd seen it played out in multiple grades, among groups ranging from the jocks down to the lunatic fringe, and while the details changed, the overall form didn't.

CM:  	Why does rock and roll mean so much to so many people?
 BG:  	The beat, I think, first and foremost.
 The beat is the heart, the human heart, it gets right inside.
 I mean, you had it before, it was there in humans, back and back.
 Listen to “Sing Sing Sing” and see if it doesn’t get inside you.
 Then, what rock did, after Rickie and Buddy and those guys, rock got a conscience.
 Partly Dylan’s doing, but it was inevitable, it was headed that way, the power of it, the communicative power.
 Man, I sound like Rolling Stone.
 What I mean is that rock wouldn’t have held it’s place if it hadn’t shifted, if the words didn’t start to mean something.
 It was time.

He saw that she was actually far out on another impossibly think branch.
 By the Infernals he swore to himself.
 She was a Forest Nymph.
 He thought he should just leave her there.
 She could do this far easier than he.
 Rodregas had an urge to leap from his branch to the other like a cat.
 Maybe he could have made it, but if he missed it was at least a hundred feet down.
 So he climbed the bark over to the other branch and then walked on the top, which was very easy.
 He followed Imeralda out on the branch until it started getting thin and began swaying.
 Then he sat on the branch.

 Flying overhead, Dieredon watched the beginning of the battle with a sickness in his stomach.
 The man in black had come.
 He watched the arrows bounce off the magical shield, and then watched the human army charge and overwhelm the small elven force that had come to face them.
 “I will keep my word, Antonil,” he said.
 “Fly back to the others, Sonowin, we will battle this day.” The horse snorted, making Dieredon laugh.
 “No, I am sure you won’t be hurt.” Sonowin banked, giving the elf one last view of the battle before soaring east to where the rest of the Quellan elves waited atop their magnificent pegasi.

He slammed himself against a house, barely dodging a downward chop of the blades.
 The orc attacked again, all his strength behind the swing.
 Harruq ducked, narrowly avoiding decapitation.
 Qurrah lunged before the orc could strike again, latching onto his wrist and letting dark magic flow.
 The orc howled at the sensation of a hundred scorpions stinging his flesh.
 Flooded with adrenaline, he hurled Qurrah aside, desperate to break the contact between them.
 Qurrah’s thin body crumpled against the dirt.
 At the sight of it, Harruq felt his rage break loose.
 He slammed his fist into the orc’s stomach, followed by a brutal kick to the groin.
 Harruq rammed his elbows into the orc’s face, baring his teeth in a feral grin as he felt cartilage crunch.

 The shirt was snug enough to see that the rest of him was built along the same lines.
 No wonder I'd bounced right off of him, a small car would've probably done about the same thing.

 I jerked my gaze back up to the handsome face just in time to see the expression settle into a genuine smile.
 "I'm so sorry.

 "No, please.
 It was entirely my fault.
 I shouldn't have tried to squeeze past you like that."

His armor shimmered as his anger grew.
 “Pretenders with wonderful toys,” the elf continued, eyeing Harruq’s blades.
 “Toys I will take from your dead bodies.”
 He leapt down the stairs in a single bound.
 His feet hardly touched before he was vaulting over a red silk couch to land before the fireplace.
 He drew an ornate sword that hung over the fireplace, letting the scabbard fall to the floor.
 The blade gleamed in the firelight, impossibly sharp and deadly.
 “I have killed a hundred like you,” Ahrqur said.
 “And I hope to kill a thousand just like you,” Harruq said, clanging his swords together one more time before lunging across the room.
 Salvation and Condemnation smacked hard against Ahrqur’s blade.

6.Government regulation is essential for a free market: A free market does not mean an unregulated one.
 Quite understandably, decades of totalitarian government had generated such powerful resentment against strong government that by way of re action the society sought for solutions which did not require government to take a highly visible, leading role.
 The reform programme was based on the implicit assumption that the market is a self-regulating mechanism which can substitute for regulation by government.
 This notion is contradicted by the experience and practice of every major market economy in the world.
 Government plays a critically important role in defining and protecting property rights, ensuring competitive conditions, controlling monopolies, regulating foreign trade, establishing and enforcing quality standards, safeguarding the rights of investors and consumers, preserving the environment from over-exploitation and pollution, encouraging investment, and upholding the rights of employees to minimum wages, safe working conditions and social security in the case of lay-offs.
 The policies that have made possible the most successful recent development initiatives of nations around the world, especially in Japan and the newly industrialized nations of the Pacific Rim, do not support the argument for unregulated free market forces.
 These countries combined freedom for entrepreneurial initiative, private property and market prices with care fully crafted industrial policies and tightly controlled foreign trade and investment practices to nurture and protect nascent industries and restrict foreign investment.
 At the same time, they organized the importation of foreign technology on a massive scale.
 They utilized import tariffs, export incentives, tax relief and other mechanisms to guide development of their domestic economies.
 The reform programme involved the dismantling of most of the administrative mechanisms by which an economy can be monitored and controlled by government.

“Why?” he asked.
 A part of him worried he might wake his brother, but he was too drained to care.
 “Why did she do that?
 She could have run faster without the child!”
 No, he knew that answer.
 She would not abandon her child just as he would not abandon Qurrah.
 Then what was bothering him so?
 He fell to his knees and stabbed the old weapons into the dirt.
 The faces of those he had killed danced before his eyes, especially the mother and her child, and the young girl holding her little sister.
 The fear in their eyes.

If they are the vagrant scum they appear to be, it will be easy enough to catch them in their crime.

 It seemed perverse that she had met Harruq by saving him from the fate she was supposed to doom him to.
 Still, Aurelia was not one to judge by appearances, and what she had seen that night had seared her heart.
 Two soldiers beating Harruq bloody without cause or reason, Harruq who was so kind to her when they sparred, who brought her flowers and told her stories, who looked upon her like she was a goddess of light in his dreary world…
 Harruq drew his sword.
 It shook in his hand.
 Aurelia watched as if in a dream.
 She felt magic spark on her fingertips.
 Under no circumstances could she watch him.

The half-orc shifted uncomfortably in the grass.
 “You know I’d never do that.”
 “No, Harruq, I don’t know.
 I think I know, I desperately want to believe I know, but I don’t.
 So promise me.”
 “Aurry…”
 “Promise me now, or I will drag you back to the elves and let them deal the justice you deserve.”
 Harruq glared into the fire.
 It was such an easy promise, but could he keep it?
 What if Velixar ordered otherwise, or someone close to Aurelia struck against Qurrah?

“Rough night?” Aurelia asked.
 She blinked as a tingle in her head insisted that something was different about the half-orc.
 After a few seconds, she saw it.
 “Harruq,” she asked, “is it me, or did you grow thirty pounds of muscle overnight?”
 “Yup,” Harruq muttered.
 “I’m magical like that.”
 The elf glared at him.
 “Sorry,” he said, his face reddening.
 “I had a long night.”
 Aurelia nodded.

Did I think I could do anything with the right words, well-placed, well-played?
 No.
 No, I knew better.
 But, I did think—I do think—that we had to stand for something other than pop ditties, you dig?
 The people who needed help—well, it was all so fucking clear then—AIM and the draft dodgers and the blacks and, Jesus, I mean, if you couldn’t see the problem you really were part of the problem.
 So, seeing it, what does one do?
 What could one do?
 Power, in the end, is just another word, too, but the power is gonna belong to someone, so, in the end, who decides?
 Who decides Nixon has more power than Mao, or John Lennon has more power than Roy Cohn?
 You dig?

I flushed and turned from her, rolling into a ball on my blankets, remembering no more than the feel of his skin on my neck, the quirk of his lips.
 I had to keep distracted, and there was nothing for it but the book.
 I wasn’t able to find much regarding humans in the study’s library.
 But I had been right.
 Illustrations and descriptions matched what I had seen.
 I know I took a risk extending Rune’s spell further, but I did not want to get caught, definitely not followed.
 I wondered if my sister was still at the original camp.
 Surely she wasn’t bright enough to figure it out.
 And apparently she wasn’t willing to tell anyone.
 I was returning to the spot I had found the humans the previous day when I ran across one of them alone.

Qurrah said not a word.
 His eyes were far away, and his lips moved but produced no sound.
 “Qurrah?” Harruq asked again.
 “Qurrah!”
 He struck his brother on the arm.
 Qurrah jolted as if suddenly waking.
 “The dead,” Qurrah said.
 “They rise.”
 Sure enough, the arrow-ridden bodies stirred.
 As if of one mind, they rose together, ignoring any injuries upon them.

I ran a finger over the smooth, dark wood and turned to see Seth crashing out of the woods.
 I smirked at him and pointed at his head.
 “You have dark blue hair.” I giggled, not knowing why I was giggling after what had just happened to us a few minutes ago.
 He frowned and pulled a piece or two out of his head.
 His eyes widened, and I laughed at the shock on his face.
 If we were dead, which was my best guess, why not poke fun at him?
 Seth smiled at me.
 “Well, yes but you have green hair.
 It’s bright green, like neon green.” I shoved my hair in front of my face.
 It was bright green all right.

His other blade stabbed, tearing away the soft flesh beneath his attacker’s ribcage.
 The elf leapt back, landed shakily, and then lunged once more.
 His speed was not what it should have been, though, and Harruq needed little opening.
 He swung both swords, the entirety of his might behind them.
 The elf blocked.
 His sword was elven-make and had been wielded in his hands for two hundred years.
 Never would he have guessed Harruq’s were older by three centuries.
 Never would he have guessed that those two blades would shatter his own, pass through the explosion of steel, sever his spine, and cleave his body in two.
 The half-orc continued his charge, engaging the two elves behind.
 They struck as one, their swords aiming for vitals high and low.

Humanity has lived with war for so many millennia that it is difficult to imagine a world without it.
 Even in the four decades of ‘peace’ following the Second World War, approximately 160 inter-state and intra-state wars, including 100 major conflicts, have been fought in developing countries, leading directly to 20 million deaths – half of them caused by the armed forces of developed countries in Korea, Indochina, Algeria and other anti-colonial wars – and to another 20 million war-related casualties.
 These massive casualties during a time of ‘peace’ are roughly equal to the total casualties incurred by all the countries of the world during the last world war.
 An equally disturbing phenomenon has been the expansion of violence within society for political purposes.
 Of the 82 armed conflicts between 1989 and 1992, only three were between states.
 During 1993, 42 countries were involved in 52 major conflicts, and another 37 experienced political violence.
 Terrorist warfare, whose principal aim is to threaten social peace, has become the model for conflicts in Northern Ireland, the Middle East and the drug war in Colombia.
 Modern means of communication, increased vulnerabilities of inter-dependent, integrated civil societies, and modern instruments of violence make these forms of war extremely destructive.
 The expansion of war to encompass society poses one of the most serious challenges to national and international security and development and raises fundamental questions regarding war as an instrument of policy.
 For more than two centuries, war has been rationalized as an appropriate instrument in international affairs.

But if she'd met Rick here, fallen in love with him, and then had to-to go to China or somewhere with him and never seen her family again, would she have done it?
 She hugged her knees, tears flowing down her cheeks.
 She knew without a doubt now that she would have.
 If she could have said good-bye to her family, let them know that she was safe and happy, she would have stayed with Rick.
 She realized now that she hadn't clung to the hope of getting home because she loved and needed and wanted her family and home more than she loved and needed and wanted Rick; she'd clung to that hope because of the feeling that she'd been .

And she hoped it would happen soon.
 After Rick had left for work, Marie walked on the treadmill for nearly 45 minutes and then made herself a cup of tea.
 Rested, she opened the box containing the exercise movie Rick had gotten her and with delight put it into the BCR.
 No--VCR, she corrected herself.
 She got so involved in the exercises and then exploring the house that she'd only watched one of the movies--"Gone with the Wind," which made her laugh sometimes and cry sometimes and held her spellbound the entire time--by 5:30, when Rick got home from work.
 “Would you like me to get you some more movies for tomorrow?” Rick asked Marie as they prepared dinner together.
 “I still have that other one to watch.
 ‘Casablanca.’”  She handed him the green peppers she’d just chopped.
 “What next?” “Mushrooms.”  He handed her a carton.
 Rick added some seasonings to the sauce he was stirring.

When we finish with them I will never fit in that armor.” Rodregas smiled at the disgust in the Hellborn’s tone and the confidence that it implied.
 “True,” Rodregas replied, “but it is pretty.
 And I would love to be facing them with one of those blue steel swords.” “Now don’t go lowering your standards, blue steel and night bronze?
 Good enough for the common soldier, but I fancy something a little more distinctive.” Rodregas was about to ask him what he had in mind when they found out why they had been waiting; two more slavers came up with drawn bows.
 They were going to take them from a safe distance.
 Doi’van and he needed no words; they both knew only instant action gave them a chance.
 Rodregas would like to have tried to take on one of the Immortal Guards, but he had already noticed that the slaver with the mace was a little too close and a little too far away from his nearest companion.
 He was a skinny man with dirty hair and seemed to be having trouble holding his heavy weapon.
 Rodregas stepped in close and the slaver swung the mace with surprising force, but he met it with the shield and knocked it aside.
 Rodregas moved with simply too much speed to be blocked.

Marie recoiled.
 "This is Rick's.
 Please don't ever let Hattie wash it or the shirt."
 She nodded toward the t-shirt on the pillow.
 Mrs. Tranton gazed down at her for a moment.
 "I'm sorry, darling."
 She kissed Marie's forehead and left.
 Marie curled up next to Rick's t-shirt still clutching his handkerchief.
 She felt so empty.
 She didn't sleep well that night but woke up early nevertheless.

A block short of the clubhouse, Tony met me.
 By the time I finished telling my plan and reasons, the rage had waned just enough so I let him have the gun.
 A few days later, Bob and I caught a ride out of Albany, Georgia with a slick young man named Johnny.
 His blond hair was oiled and wavy.
 He wore a silk shirt and drove a fast, red convertible.
 Though he claimed to have gotten out of prison only yesterday, he blazed at about twice the speed limit down Highways 19 and 41 into Florida and all the way to Miami.
 He talked about money, women, and other stuff he’d missed while in prison.
 When he asked if we would be looking for work in Miami and we said probably, he nodded and chucked my arm.
 “Hey, the boss will set you up.” The boss lived in a palace on a canal.
 He was a midget who needed a wheelchair, but whose live-in babe was about twice his height and half his age.

I would owe her.
 I had to stop reading as betrayal ripped through me again.
 Junnie.
 Ruby laid her hands on mine, which were trembling now, but I would not take the dust again.
 Tears streamed silently as I drifted, the ache in my chest only dulled by exhaustion.
 I felt weak when I woke, but I was silent about the pain as we continued the journey.
 Yearning to avoid my thoughts altogether, I spent much of the day in the mind of my horse.
 And the day passed.
 It was evening again when we stopped.
 I barely noticed the group’s mood; though quiet, they seemed anxious and kept the perimeter close.

Rodregas felt the guard’s face give way to his rage and unnatural strength.
 For a moment the guard struggled to escape his hold, but Rodregas pulled him closer with one hand and with the other ripped his opponent’s face away.
 Rodregas felt a stab in his back as he took either an arrow or a sword.
 He was groggy with pain, and both weak and filled with rage.
 The guard in his hands was thrashing and spasming in unspeakable pain.
 As the guard collapsed to the ground, Rodregas fell with him.
 He tried to once more roll to the side, struggling away from a potential final stroke.
 Rodregas’ face was covered in gore and blood.
 It was hard for him to see.
 He struggled back up, but fell, then Rodregas felt a presence to his right.

Restless now, Rick began wrapping up for the day.
 He’d been a junior vice president at Ward and Lee Realty since 2008, a position that involved a great deal of paperwork.
 Sometimes he missed spending the entire day visiting properties and dealing, but the behind-the-scenes work had its own challenges.
 Besides, on the occasions that he did the actual dealing, it was always a prime piece of real estate and clients who were rich or famous or both.
 Boston was a terrific place to be a realtor.
 Just after 7:00 Rick drove onto his own little bit of Boston in the Back Bay.
 He'd had his house built on a beautiful acre that was located on the southeast edge of the area inhabited by Boston's elite.
 Real estate prices there were outrageous, but Rick, with his connections and eye for property, had gotten this parcel for next to nothing.
 It was only a few blocks from the downtown area and considered too close for comfort by true members of the upper class.
 But for Rick it was perfect.

After deciding in my favor, he said, “There’s a big change coming.
 I don’t know what it will be.
 It’s something I feel so deeply, like nothing I ever felt before.
 Maybe it’ll be good.
 Maybe not.
 All I know is, everything is going to be different.

 Her squad danced at basketball games.

“It’s time to move,” someone said.
 Came for me.
 “No, not yet.” Someone else.
 They killed him.
 And I was glad.
 “There could be more,” Grey insisted.
 That brought me back, no matter how disturbing my realization was.
 “More?” Chevelle gave the bickering group an admonishing glare as he approached me.
 I could hear the alarm in my own voice when I repeated, “There are more council members coming for me?” He tried to calm me.
 “Frey—” I cut him off.

 That’s Memphis.

A tiny crack of light allowed me about three-quarters of Chevelle’s back and all of his guest.
 Ruby.
 She looked to be a little shorter than me, a little smaller, but seemed larger somehow.
 I thought I knew why.
 Around her petite face, by some means both wicked and charming, was a mane of deep crimson hair flowing in curls.
 I considered her name, given that mass of hair, but any sympathy disappeared as she reached out a hand toward Chevelle.
 There was something sinful about it, the way her hand turned seductively in the simple task of retrieving the stone from him.
 My stone.
 Anger swelled in me.
 I wasn’t sure if I had given it to Chevelle because I’d trusted him, or because he was my captor, but I couldn’t shake the feeling of betrayal.

 “Elves came and attacked.

 “No, it’s not all forgiven,” he said, grabbing his brother’s shoulders.
 “I can see it in your eyes.
 Please understand.
 I would have given anything to be there with you.”
 Qurrah’s bloodshot eyes lost their rage and sorrow.

He immediately launched himself onto Emily.
 She screeched and I thought I saw one of the kids turn around.
 He crawled up to her ear and whispered something that I couldn’t hear.
 She froze, but I saw her place her hands on his wrinkled skin.
 Fire flared from her fingertips, scorching his skin.
 He let out a screech and vaulted off her, running as fast as his legs could take him.
 I held an arrow out and Emily set it ablaze.
 I drew back, launching the arrow, and watching it as it hit the dwarf in the back.
 The fire charred its dying body and I looked away to face my new attacker.
 One jumped on my head and I swung with my knife.

"Not forget, no, just maybe be a little late."
 As abruptly as that, the interplay between the two siblings ended, leaving an uncomfortable silence as odd as the affection from a moment before.
 We walked to Alec's car in silence, the pair of them apparently lost in their own thoughts, and me wondering why Alec had agreed to give me a ride home.
 I wasn't enough of a car aficionado to recognize the vehicle other than the fact that it was a matte gray and had the kind of smooth, exotic lines all of the high-end vehicles seemed to be striving for right now.
 Rachel slipped in the backseat while I was still wondering how this seemingly low-profile ride matched up against Brandon's Mustang.
 "Did you enter the drawing for Les Misérables tickets?"
 I looked over to find Rachel sitting in the middle of the seat, happily leaning forward so she could talk to us.
 "Yes, but so did everyone else.
 My chances are so dismal they're not even worth mentioning."
 Rachel looked like she was going to argue, or say something cheerful, but the back of my mind had been trying to figure out how she could be even with us, but still sitting in the back seat.

I turned and plunged my knife into its back before it could respond and it fell to the ground.
 I felt pain flare in my right foot and looked down to see a frost beast with its teeth in my leg.
 When I tried to pull away, in bit down harder.
 “Ow,” I yelped.
 “Ow,ow,ow, get the heck off me!” I slashed downward and the frost beast let go of my leg.
 It zipped between my legs and launched itself at my left leg.
 I stepped to the side and slammed my foot on the beast’s back.
 It yipped and went still.
 I raced through the crowds, jumping and ducking.
 I looked over my shoulder and up the hill, wishing I could escape all the bodies that were pressed together in combat.

I’m ready to listen to what you have to say.
 Cleo – I doubt that this is the ideal location for a proper mother to daughter talk, but we aren’t exactly the ideal mother and daughter.
 I should have done this a long time ago, but I was busy with other things then… Where to begin.
 With the basics I suppose, you already know about the mechanics of sex, but it’s up to me to fill you in on men themselves.
 Men are stupid.
 I mean it in the most loving way possible.
 But, men are stupid.
 They’re blind, they don’t see or understand what is standing right in front of them, what is absolutely plain to you and I.
 Take you’re friend Jim for example, I doubt its even crossed his mind that you have any romantic interest in him what-so-ever.
 He is blissfully un-aware that you have been mooning over him for the last ten years of your lives, though I think you could have made a better choice.

Where is it coming from, I wonder?
 After a while, I give up wondering and pray for an answer.
 When no answer arrives, I decide to track my thoughts backward, which leads me to the source, which was a recognition that I had lived much of my life in the aftermath of a grievous mistake.
 If I hadn't been so stubborn, if I had trusted God from the time I first believed, I might've spent all these years in a richer world, maybe not living every moment in the kingdom of heaven, but residing close enough so I could visit more regularly.
 And I might've done a lot of good for other people.
 In this sorry condition, I decide that my darkest sin, the one so loathsome I should never stop grieving over it, isn't any of the wicked stuff I have thought or done.
 My darkest sin is failing to do all the thousands of good works I could have done for people.
 All because I was willful and didn't allow myself to truly love them.
 Some folks would assure me this sadness and guilt means a spiritual battle is raging.
 As I tried to enter the kingdom of God, demons escalated their assaults on my soul.

Those words were even rarer than his kisses; she'd heard them only twice before.
 "I love you too, Davis."
 Caught up in the evening's enchantment, she gazed up into his eyes, hoping he'd kiss her again.
 But Davis stepped back and turned to draw her arm through his, grinding his teeth.
 He wanted to throw her to the ground and tear off her clothes, and every time he was alone with this beautiful ingénue, his self-control took a tremendous beating.
 All that made him maintain it was the knowledge that her father would kill him if he laid a finger on her before marriage.
 He glanced at his watch; he'd get Marie home by midnight and then spend a couple of hours at Mae's establishment.
 "Now it is a perfect evening."
 Marie smiled.
 "Every night in Hollywood must be like this."

Brandon told her that he needed to run a quick errand.
 She called me later that day and said she had lost track of him and he wasn’t returning her calls or answering his phone.
 All the usual horrible thoughts began to surface in our minds.
 The day turned into night and we still hadn’t heard from him.
 Close to midnight, as Lisa and I watched a movie together in the dark, there was a loud banging at our back sliding glass door.
 Our dogs went crazy—they were as startled as we were.
 Who the fuck was at our back door?
 It was Brandon’s druggie friend, high as a kite, rambling a mile a minute.
 What would possess him to go to the backdoor and not the front but being high and thus, stupid.
 Brandon had been arrested, he told us, in a set-up drug sting.

What was it the mayor had said?
 "I can't promise he'll even read it."
 It was a he who'd intervened on our behalf, and Rachel and Alec's father had died years ago, while Brandon's father...actually I knew next to nothing about Brandon's parents.
 I wasn't even sure whether or not they were around.
 They must be though--if it had been a male who'd saved us, then it couldn't be the Graveses, and that left only Brandon's family.
 It was hard to believe that Brandon had stepped in and done so much for us, but the pieces fit together so tightly.
 Brandon was even more wonderful and amazing than I'd thought before.
 Part of me expected this new revelation to keep my mind whirling so fast that it would take me hours to go to sleep.
 I was only partly right.
 It took quite a while for me to go to sleep, but this time the culprit was the light outside my window.

I felt a giggle surge past my lips, and pressed them tight before I could completely embarrass myself.
 "That's amazing.
 My dad thought knowing how to dance would make my first dance easier.
 It turned out to be a complete waste of time.
 Nobody asked me to dance and his lessons wouldn't have helped even if they had.
 Still, now I wish I'd done a better job of learning."
 Alec nodded, but there was a distracted air to the gesture.
 I waited while we made another quarter of a journey, him gracefully, me not quite so much, around the floor, before opening my mouth to speak, but he beat me to it.
 "I don't suppose either of us talk about our dads much.
 I'm not pushing, but if you ever need to talk about him, about what happened, I'll listen.

This necessitates, not only a change from one economic system to another, but also a restructuring of the entire economy from a defence orientation to a consumer orientation.
 This change in structure could not be brought about by reliance on macro-economic policy.
 2.Political and social consensus is essential for rapid social change: In a democratic society, the market cannot be instituted by decrees or authoritarian methods which belong to the old sys tem.
 In the new political climate, reforms will be successful only in the measure that they are understood and accepted by the population.
 The vitality of the market depends on releasing the initiative of people to act in their own perceived best interests by producing and distributing goods and services for consumption by others.
 This initiative cannot be ordered, it can only be encouraged.
 Economic policy recommendations failed adequately to anticipate either the impact of the programme on the people or their reaction to it.
 In the early stages of reform, the public exhibited an incredible degree of patience, tolerance and endurance under conditions of growing hardship.
 Gradually public resentment and personal suffering (especially for the aged, children and new entrants to the work force) became so severe in some countries that no government could have sustained the programme without facing political upheaval or violent revolution.
 There is some truth in the argument that ‘shock therapy’ did not fail in Russia and other countries, because it was never actually implemented.

I think about kissing you and touching you--with your shirt off."
 She kissed him, her hands moving restlessly over his chest.
 Nuzzling his ear, she told him, "It's probably wrong for me to tell you these things.
 But I want to tell you everything.
 I want you to know how I feel."
 Rick pulled her onto his lap and began devouring her mouth.
 If he didn't know better, he'd swear she was the most cunning seductress he'd ever known.
 Her innocence combined with her confession was a powerful aphrodisiac.
 She was so trusting and yet so passionate, her mouth as hungry as his, her hands caressing and clutching and clawing at his chest and shoulders and neck.
 Hadn't she understood a word he'd said?

I felt my eyes go wide at all the new terms, but kept my mouth shut because I was worried Rachel would clam up if I started asking questions.
 "I'm pretty sure Alec could take two of them, but not all three.
 They knew that, which was part of the reason they were pushing so hard."
 I felt shivers crawl up my spine, but what could someone say after something like that?
 Rachel reached over and gave me a hug.
 "Try not to think about it too much.
 Just remember that Alec's dominant to everyone here, and he'd die for either of us without even a heartbeat's worth of hesitation."
 After Rachel left I spent the next hour trying to get comfortable in Alec's desk chair.
 It was likely the discomfort was more due to the subject matter than the chair, but I just couldn't get comfortable.
 I finally moved my books over to the bed and sprawled out on it.

I hadn’t slept, and I knew I would have to sneak a nap in at some point, but I had priorities.
 It might be my last opportunity for a real bath.
 And lovely soaps.
 I sat with Steed for a while after I’d bathed.
 He was reclined on the bench, his feet propped on a low table.
 He didn’t seem as excited as Ruby had been about our coming trip, so I asked him about it.
 “I’m just riding the wind, Frey.” “Oh, so you don’t know where we’re going either?” He laughed.
 “No, I know where we are going.
 It’s only that I don’t know where we’ll end up.” I didn’t know what was going to happen either.
 I thought of the tracker and realized what a good distraction the book had been.

A long, damp stone corridor lit with torches… not mine.
 There was Junnie, her blonde hair shining in the sun as she greeted me at her door on the west side of the village.
 And Junnie, mysterious under a hooded cloak, fighting with magic and weaponry, killing members of the council guard.
 We sat around a fire, telling stories.
 Someone was ribbing Ruby.
 Her eyes narrowed when she replied to him, matter-of-factly, “Your mouth is very small.
 It’s unattractive.” And her head bobbed side to side as she smiled, pleased with herself.
 Anvil laughed and his tongue wagged.
 He was holding someone by the arm, preventing them from running away.
 Suddenly, my vision changed and I was a hawk, attacking, tearing a piece from his tongue.

Ahrqur gave him his reason, and it was beautiful.”
 “What is it your slave did?” Qurrah asked.
 “In a court full of human nobles, he broke through, slew four of them, and then took the king’s left ear.” Velixar laughed.
 “He killed five guards before he was slain.
 Two more died in the fiery consumption of his corpse.”
 Qurrah smiled at the image.
 Harruq’s blood heated at the thought of battle, but the coldness in his stomach refused to succumb.
 “Vaelor cannot yet risk war,” Velixar continued.
 “He must have all the people see him as a peaceful man driven to conflict.

Encouraging voluntary part-timism by removing the artificial barriers to job sharing created by employment laws, social security tax laws, administrative procedures and trade unions would raise the morale and productivity of those who prefer to work less, while creating openings for many who are now without jobs.
 In the Netherlands, voluntary part-timism has been identified as the biggest single potential for creating new jobs, capable of reducing the country's unemployment by up to 50 per cent.
 Proportionately reducing working hours and salaries can spread the existing work more evenly over more people.
 Evidence suggests that reduced working time can raise productivity significantly.
 Extending vacation time and medical leave in the United States nearer to levels which the Europeans enjoy would create many more job openings.
 Work or job sharing is not an ultimate answer in itself, but it can have a beneficial short-term impact, allowing time for longer-term measures to take effect.
 As a minimum, governments should remove the artificial barriers to job-sharing created by employment laws, administrative procedures and trade unions.
 Social security tax systems should also be modified to remove the in-built bias that increases the taxes of those who hold multiple, part-time jobs, rather than one full-time job.
 Such constraints limited part-time jobs to around 10 per cent of the total in Belgium, France, Italy and Spain compared to around 25 per cent in Britain and Denmark.
 4.Modify tax policies:The present income and payroll tax system raises the real cost of labour relative to other resources, such as capital and energy, and thereby discourages job creation.

Only I don't really believe you, so we're instituting a new policy.
 If I catch you sniffing around him again, I'll kill you.
 No questions asked."
 My pulse skyrocketed as the raw terror hit.
 I'd heard death threats a couple of times before.
 You don't go to a school of any size without seeing fights, and usually by the time girls resort to physical confrontations they really are serious about hurting the other person.
 When girls say they're going to kill each other, they mean it.
 This was something else entirely though.
 Whoever was on the other side of the flimsy metal door I was hiding behind didn't just believe she would kill the other girl, she knew it, like someone who'd killed before.
 As scared as I was, I should have been a gibbering wreck, but strangely enough part of my mind was coldly rational.

The next morning they repeated the Morning Prayer and meditation ritual.
 This time while Doi’van joined in, Imeralda mostly watched.
 Afterwards Rodregas said to both, “I have been thinking that we are probably going to be here a few weeks while I finish healing up from the knife wound.
 I want to make the most of the time.” Doi’van said, “I have a feeling that you have some sort of training in mind.” Rodregas nodded and said, “I have developed some bad habits the last few years; I know my technique is rusty and now my timing is all off with my new body.
 I am not sure what your training backgrounds are, though.” He said, waving at Imeralda, who often of late was holding her Black Yew bow close with an intimacy that spoke more of a caress than holding a weapon, “Clearly, Imeralda likes the bow.” Rodregas continued, “Even though Imeralda plans to stay out of the middle of things, learning some basic hand-to-hand and sword fighting is a good idea.
 Doi’van and I can spar with each other, which will help us get used to fighting against the sigil warriors of The Immortal Guard.
 So, I think we should practice every morning until noon, then work to try to get the farm cleaned up during the rest of the day.
 At dusk we can work again on our fighting technique.” Doi’van nodded and said, “Before we battle a group of Immortalists or The Immortal Guards, we need to get some decent armor and weapons.
 They will have the finest equipment that the Guild sorcerers can make or buy.
 While the two of us might be a match for most of the sigil warriors’ one on one, their equipment will make them hard to beat.” “I agree that has to be something we figure out,” Rodregas said, “but, I am actually thinking decent horses might be more important first.” “Horses?

I opened my mouth, but just simply didn't know what to say.
 The horror of being trapped in a body that was riddled with old injuries was something thousands of people faced every day, but it seemed even more of a shame for someone who'd once been so vital and strong.
 Mallory's smile held only the faintest hint of regret.
 "No need to feel sorry for me.
 I've had a good run.
 A much better one than most of my friends did.
 If I haven't managed to accomplish what I was sent down to do in the course of almost a hundred and fifty years, then I've nobody to blame but myself."
 "Still, I'm sorry.
 You seem much too nice of a person to have had all of that happen to you."

I kept reading, quickly scanning for something of interest.
 My eyes caught on his name a second before my mind recognized it… Chevelle Vattier.
 As I backed up to read, my shock and disbelief turned to fury before I could even finish the page.
 Chevelle Vattier had been a volunteer watcher.
 A Council spy.
 He had volunteered to watch me.
 Swift, white-hot anger flooded through me and the pages I held burst into flames.
 The brush around me caught next, burning away as I stood to push free of the blazing patch of briars.
 They had set a watcher on me.
 Why?

Brandon's energy beat down on Alec, beat down on all of us, but although I could feel the answering flare of power from the rest of the pack, Alec remained silent, dancing away from the worst bursts of metaphorical death at the same time he dodged Brandon's fangs.
 The flares were almost dead, but there was just enough light for me to see the smaller figure reel away from the larger as a vicious slash sank home in Alec's chest.
 Time stretched and pulled like taffy, and I had plenty of time to watch Alec fall, to feel splatters of hot liquid even standing so far away.
 A scream ripped itself free from my throat, and it suddenly seemed we really were caught up in a hurricane.
 As the flares finally died, the pulsing pressure, the pins and needles disappeared as well.
 Only that wasn't quite the term for it.
 The power, the energy that'd become more than oppressive, was sucked towards Alec and Brandon, dragging with it my strength, and the unnatural vitality of the rest of the pack.
 I felt a lance of pain sink into my back, mirroring the jolt in my ankle, as all five shape shifters collapsed around me.
 I knew with a certainty I was going to die, that we were all going to die, but that didn't matter.
 It was only right that my existence cease within heartbeats of Alec's.

They were Alec's eyes, but they were also the eyes of his beast, and I suddenly realized the dominance stuff wasn't just a game.
 There was a feral part of Alec that didn't play well with others, that would kill or be killed in turn rather than have his will thwarted.
 A complex collage of emotions flooded through my system as I tried to process what that meant, and whether or not I needed to be scared.
 As suddenly as it'd changed before, Alec's fist relaxed, shrinking back into its normal size and shape like melting snow.
 "All right.
 You can come.
 I don't like it.
 Don't like knowing you're guaranteed not to survive my passing, but it's your choice."
 I was too busy being amazed by how quickly he'd stopped shaking, how rapidly his eyes had gone back to normal to really wonder whether or not it was all just an elaborate ruse designed to lull me into a false sense of security so he could trap me here.
 "Not that I'm complaining, mind you, but why the sudden change?"

I laid it aside, reaching back in.
 My fingers closed around a tube, probably a scroll case.
 I had started to take it out when I heard the wheezing growl behind me.
 I froze.
 The stream of profanities that followed was long and harsh; part sounded like it was in another tongue.
 I released the tube and turned slowly toward Fannie.
 She was livid, red-faced and shaking.
 She stepped toward me, and I slid the pouch that lay against my leg behind my sash.
 She didn’t seem to notice.
 The blow was quick, and I hadn’t seen it coming.

But as I lingered there, I knew the cause.
 I was seeing from a horse.
 We were outside the stone walls of the fortress finding sparse greens to eat, which bored me even in a dream.
 I encouraged the horse to run and he responded immediately, taking flight down the mountainside.
 The rocks streaked past us as we ran faster and faster, the wind whipping his mane.
 A great bird perched on the dead limb of an ironwood tree and I jumped to it just as it dropped from the branch and flared its wings out to catch the wind.
 We flew still farther as I watched the mountain pass below.
 There was a scrubby patch of trees ahead and I could see movement there, inside.
 I tried to focus on it… familiar silver and white.
 Commotion brought me back and I sat up, startled.

Yes, it could.
 It came back to me then.
 I dropped into a chair, my head falling into my hands to cover my face.
 Ruby started to say something, but Chevelle cut her off.
 “Won’t you offer your guest breakfast?” She sniffed.
 “Lunch maybe.” A plate of food landed on the table in front of me with a slap.
 “Thank you,” I managed.
 I was hungry, despite the embarrassment.
 I grabbed the plate and started eating.
 Ruby and Steed were sitting across from me.

That's about the size of it.
 She's still hiding something from me, but I'm not willing to bleed her to try and get an answer, not when odds are she'll just refuse to tell me anyways."
 That was edging towards a secret that wasn't mine to tell.
 "Let's talk about something happier."
 He looked at me out of the corner of his eye.
 He'd probably heard my pulse spike.
 Sometimes the fact that he was a shape shifter instead of just a normal boy was pretty inconvenient.
 Of course if he wasn't a shape shifter, then he wouldn't really be Alec.
 "Your mom is likely to be back in town pretty soon.

A detached part of me noted that it was just like Mom to have lied about having lost Cindi's.
 She'd known I couldn't handle the reminder of what we'd lost, but she'd been unwilling to give up that link to the past.
 The thought slipped away like sunlight skipping across water a split second before the storm arrived.
 The attack was a bad one.
 I lost more time.
 I must have slept at some point, but the next time I surfaced it was Saturday morning and I was sitting in front of an empty bowl with an unopened box of cereal and a gallon of milk waiting in the wings.
 At some point I realized I wasn't hungry.
 I put everything back away and went upstairs for a shower.
 It didn't help.
 By the time I was done, I was clean but just as emotionally numb as before.

I made up that little middle bit, and, then, as discussed—I think we talked about this—a little piece of Jimi’s “Third Stone from the Sun,” thrown in at the beginning, as a tribute, because he had just died and I was in mourning when I wrote that.
 CM: 	“Squonk?”
 BG: 	Yeah, dig.
 You know what a squonk is, right?
 It’s like, what’s that song Cocker did so well, “I’m Gonna Drown in my Own Tears,” right?
 Squonks cry themselves to death, dissolve in their own tears.
 That’s what I mean by the ironic twists to I Was A Child.
 This charge of self-pity, yeah, man, I’m on it, I dig.
 It’s right there on the album, if you really listened to it, if you listened with more than your ears, man.
 The repetition of “I’m crying”—almost three minutes of it, I know—it goes back to “I’m Gonna Sit Right Down and Cry Over You” and Lennon’s “I Want You.”  You know, you strip it down, you get right to the core phrase, the essential thing you wanna say—that’s what I’m getting at.

Quick!”
 “I will do no such thing,” Qurrah said.
 “I said hey!” shouted the same man.
 Harruq stepped in front of Qurrah and then turned, staring down a group of five heavily armored guards.
 Swords and clubs hung from their belts, though a fifth carried a weapon neither of them had ever seen before.
 It was a wooden stick with a bulbous gem on one end.
 “You stop when asked or pay the price,” said one of the guards.
 “If he can even understand us,” said another.
 “We understand perfectly,” Qurrah said, stepping to one side.
 “What has my brother done to warrant your attention?”

But I bet you'll walk back into 1927 when you least expect it."
 That thought depressed him.
 She saw the sadness in his eyes and leaned forward to lay her hand on his knee.
 "I enjoy being here with you, Rick.

 If she'd met him in 1927, she'd probably have felt every bit as much confusion as she was feeling now.

A pair of slender elves stepped in sync as they stopped just outside the group.
 They were tall and lean, dressed in robes the color of ash that only accentuated their shocking silver hair.
 I was convinced the moonlight must have been exaggerating it.
 And then I jumped again as, on either side of them, two beasts walked forward to stand just in front of the twinned elves.
 Steed brushed an arm against mine, mumbling under his breath, “Yeah, they’re not from around here.” I felt myself leaning on Chevelle for support.
 “Rhys and Rider Strong,” he said from behind me.
 They nodded and I was surprised the small gesture also seemed in step.
 A strange whine emanated from one of the dogs as they shifted to sit on their haunches.
 By their size, I might have guessed they were wolves, but I’d never known a wolf to be tamed.
 Their fur matched the robes of their masters, down to the black trim.

The security, stability, productivity, growth and sustainability of society are determined by its values.
 This report calls upon nations and the international community to make a conscious shift to values that can generate greater domestic and international security, higher rates of sustainable growth, and more equitable distribution of benefits for all.
 The insistence on immediate abolition of war, eradication of poverty, democratic human rights and full employment expresses a commitment to the pre-eminent values of human life, social and economic as well as political freedom, and the development of the full potential of the individual.
 The achievement of these high human values also requires the achievement of a large number of physical, organizational, social and psychological values: higher productivity, better quality, more efficient utilization of resources, faster speed, more systematic functioning, improved coordination and cooperation, punctuality, cleanliness, open-mindedness, tolerance, harmony and a host of other values essential for high achievement in any field.
 Therefore, we have stressed repeatedly the importance of the value of integration in the formulation of strategies, of maximum utilization of human and social as well as material and technological resources, of greater speed and organization, and other values.
 Values are a powerful instrument to spur development.
 They are goals or standards that set the direction and mobilize the collective cultural energies of the society for great accomplishment.
 They prompt us to strive for the maximum that is conceivable, rather than the mini mum that is achievable.
 Values form the basis for the tremendous developmental achievements of the past two hundred years, such as the Japanese commitment to teamwork and consensus, the American devotion to enterprise and innovation, the German dedication to quality, and the Dutch commitment to partnership with other people, rather than exploitation.
 Development is retarded by the slow pace at which new values are acquired, which normally requires a change of generation.

The room had several large circles in the floor and tables and shelves along the side.
 The shelves held bones and bowls of strange fluids and other items whose uses he could not imagine.
 Anything that felt foul he threw into the fireplace, after getting a good flame going.
 Several books and strange containers ended up in the fire, though he did find two books that felt of magic that he kept.
 He also found a small statue of a strange green mechanical frog that had that magic tingle to it.
 He could not imagine its use; it appeared a simple toy, but he put it in his pile to take.
 There was a heavy oak cabinet in the corner which he forced open.
 Inside were large pottery containers, which he had seen before.
 They held some of the magic powders used to make the circles that were so important to many of the most powerful of the Immortalist’s spells.
 He checked the powders for magic and several came off very strong so he added them to the pile.

 The best fighters are the best thinkers.” “Fighters?” I asked, confused.
 He shook his head again, as if clearing it.
 There was a long pause as I waited for his answer.
 “I’d like you to practice just for protection.” “I have fire.” He picked up a fallen branch, long and jagged, and snapped the smaller twigs from its side.
 “Yes, but you should learn to think more openly.

But that made no sense to Rodregas.
 The chamber seemed to be the same size as the one they had entered and if one of the great towers had been in the middle there would be hardly room to fit it, and yet the trunk was not that close to them from the door and was not near any of the walls.
 So it was either smaller around, which was impossible because of the height, or the chamber must be far smaller.
 Rodregas shook his head in confusion.
 “What is that?” asked Doi’van.
 Imeralda smiled a soft smile, one that for a brief moment brought memories of the two of them back at the farm.
 “I,” she started and then paused as if caught up in her own words, “I think that is the ‘One Tree.’” At the responding look of confusion she said, “The legendary source of all Nymphs.
 While we serve the Gods like all mortals, the One Tree is our source.

“Why?” A wry smile crossed his lips and I couldn’t help but focus on them for a moment.
 “Because the wolves would have fought to the death, and Grand Council does not kill animals with magic.” I remembered my mother.
 “Only elves?” His mocking smile widened.
 “Only elves.” They thought killing an animal with magic was evil, dark, but they were hunting us down.
 To burn us.
 I considered the alternative—pierced through with arrows, blessed with a prayer—and I laughed.
 His eyes were intense as he reached to gently cup my neck, fingers resting at my spine, thumb grazing the base of my ear.
 I felt him urge me forward, and my breath caught, heart stuttering into a broken lope.
 And then Ruby was beside us from out of nowhere, her words startling me back to the cold, dull room.
 “They’re coming in.” Chevelle leaned back, his fingers brushing my collarbone when he pulled away.

Though she was big and hearty, today she looked undone, like a visitor to Auschwitz.
 “Sit down, Kenneth.” “What’d I do?” “It’s about Eric.” Studying her mournful eyes, I eased myself into the chair.
 “Yeah?” “They crashed.” My heart stopped and I gave up breathing.
 “Eric?” I gasped.
 "El Cajon Valley Hospital.
 They don’t believe he’ll make it.” My brain catapulted through space, into a black hole.
 There I remembered the night my mom checked into the hospital and the doctor said she was probably a goner.
 “He’ll make it,” I said with defiance.
 “He’s Superman.” She nodded.

Instead of a massive outflow of foreign currency through conversion of superdinars, people have rushed to cash in their foreign currency, resulting in a 60 per cent increase in the nation's reserves during the first three months.
 One of the most significant features of the programme has been its fair distribution of benefits and low social cost to the population.
 In contrast with the widespread outrage felt by Russian citizens over repeated episodes of demonetization and confiscation of household savings, the Yugoslav people have enthusiastically accepted the new currency as representative of a new deal for the poor and the working class.
 In addition, instead of the severe contraction of output experienced elsewhere, production rose by more than 100 per cent during the first five months, stimulating an increase in employment and demand for new investment.
 Real tax revenues have increased significantly.
 The astonishing initial success of the programme can be attributed to its balance and comprehensiveness, and to the following specific features: the government's recognition that stabilization was absolutely essential to economic recovery; the widespread public support for the programme, which was in large part due to the efforts to protect weaker sections from its harshest effects; the simultaneous relaxation of controls on industry; support for a natural rather than a forced process of privatization, based on the specific circumstances of each firm rather than on ideology; continued price supports for agriculture and a minimum wage for labour, which are crucial for maintaining food supplies and social stability; and rejection of import liberalization in order to protect domestic manufacturing against a major shock during the initial period of recovery.
 Possibly the greatest strength of the Yugoslav programme is that it was of necessity conceived by people within the country rather than by foreign experts, and depended entirely on domestic resources and capabilities for its accomplishment, rather than on pleas for foreign assistance.
 Self-reliance released the creativity, generated the determination and mobilized all available resources to make the transition successful.
 It is too early to predict the eventual outcome in Yugoslavia, subject as it is to extraordinary external constraints on public policy.
 However, the initial evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that alternative approaches can and must be fashioned which are more comprehensive in scope, more balanced in implementation, more pragmatic in conception and less influenced by extreme ideological viewpoints.

 “Yup,” Harruq laughed.
 “Mum was always smart for an orc.

 “You are a wise man,” Dieredon said, breaking the moment.
 “You know who is in the right in this conflict, as do I.”
 “Yes, we both do,” Antonil agreed.
 He glanced to the elf, his face asking the question he could not voice.
 “No, I will not fight at their side,” Dieredon answered.
 “Never could I raise my bladed bow against you.
 However, I cannot fight against my brethren.

 Mrs. Campbell gave me a tired smile.

 It would just be minimum wage, but I think you'll find you quite enjoy teaching."
 Still at a loss for words, I just nodded.
 I started towards the door as soon as I was dismissed, but stopped at the threshold.

 He raised her knuckles to his lips.

 "It doesn't.

Rodregas thought that they were heading along the right path.
 Imeralda asked, “Does that mean that in this room these are great sigils as well?

 Jeremiah Stoutmire walked through the village of Cornrows, the hair on his neck erect.
 The cool spring breeze was weak compared to the ice that locked his spine.
 He held a torch in one hand and a shortsword in the other.
 At first, he had thought himself foolish waking in a full panic from a nightmare he could not remember.
 Then he saw others about, lit torches in their hands, and he knew his fear was justified.
 A young, fat-nosed farmer saw him awake and approached.
 “Couldn’t sleep either, Jeremiah?” he asked.

Neither spoke, so I lowered my gaze to the floor, taking the shortest route to Ruby’s door and closing it hastily behind me.
 Chevelle spoke to his guest and I groaned internally, wishing I’d heard their low voices earlier.
 Asher, as Chevelle had called the man, was apparently leaving.
 It sounded as if Chevelle was trying to persuade him in some way, but the man was short and cold in his responses.
 Quiet, too.
 I imagined he didn’t want me to hear them.
 Paranoia, my mind accused.
 I heard the front door close as I flopped onto the bed, only to jolt upright when Ruby’s door opened a few seconds later.
 It was Chevelle.
 My courage was gone again.

 She hopped over and gave me a small embrace.

 She bounced back over to Jason's side and waited for me to continue but there was nothing else to say.
 I had told her everything I needed to tell her.
 Did she somehow know that I wasn't telling her the whole story?
 I looked at Seth out of the corner of my eye and saw him doing the same.
 We needed to talk longer and more in depth about the situation we were sharing.
 “So,” Emily said and tapped her fingers on the cave wall, “is that all?” “Yes.” “Well then,” she looked us in the eyes, “what are we waiting for?

Currently 11 per cent of the world’s land surface is used for agricultural crops, just 4 per cent more than in 1960.
 A comprehensive theoretical study of soils, climate, vegetation and topography conducted in 1975 indicated that both land and water utilized for agriculture could be doubled, if necessary, and that the earth could support 36 times the 1975 level (18 times the 1990 level) of cereal production using the same share of cultivated land.
 There would be severe practical obstacles to such a vast expansion of croplands, but these findings suggest that physical limitations to food production are not the primary constraints.
 A more commonly accepted estimate indicates that the world’s land and water used for agriculture could more than double.
 Agriculture’s Dual Role
 Achieving food security necessitates increasing food production and employment opportunities.
 Agriculture plays a dual role in the abolition of hunger – it produces the food and it can also produce a great many of the jobs needed by households to buy food in developing countries.
 Since agriculture is the world’s single largest employer, raising production and productivity in this sector can immediately place additional purchasing power in the hands of the rural poor, who will in turn utilize the additional income for purchasing more food, clothing and other basic consumer goods that will create more jobs and higher incomes for countless others.
 The increased agricultural produce becomes raw material for a wide range of agro-based industries and services that stimulate formation of new enterprises, and create downstream jobs as well as products for further processing, domestic sale or export.
 This is the rationale behind the Prosperity 2000 strategy for India, which forms a viable model for many other countries to emulate.

Crime is on the rise.
 Ominous signs have appeared that the authoritarian past is not yet fully buried and could once again arise, if the forward momentum of the transition process does not quickly improve the lives of people within the region.
 The whole world has an immense stake in the successful outcome of the transition in Eastern Europe.
 Initial Results of Reform
 The pre-existent conditions, the starting point of the transition, the timing, speed and extent of the reforms introduced during the past five years varied considerably among the 25 nations of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
 But, with few exceptions, they were founded on the same general principles and on the policy recommendations of Western proponents of rapid transformation to total free-market liberal capitalism, based on a simultaneous shock strategy encompassing macro-economic stabilization, prices and property rights.
 Western governments and the international financial institutions, led by the IMF, strongly advocated this approach and linked financial assistance to its adoption.
 The strategy called for rapid deregulation of prices, privatization of farms and industry, introduction of a convertible currency, and balancing the budget to reduce the high fiscal deficits, primarily by reducing military expenditure and subsidies to producers and consumers.
 The assumption was that a programme with these elements would result in a significant increase in production, efficiency and the availability of consumer goods within a short time.
 The actual results were quite contrary to the expectations of these countries’ Western economic advisers, as well as to the governments and people of the region.

In a region as vast and diverse as this and in countries such as Russia, which extends over eleven time zones, no single model or pattern will be widely applicable.
 Therefore, several areas in each country representing different economic and social conditions should be selected for establishment of model transition programmes.
 In each area, a study should be conducted of resources and economic potentials, existing institutions and infrastructure, current levels of skill and social attitudes regarding the market system.
 Detailed strategies should be devised to educate the public about untapped opportunities, strengthen the institutional infrastructure, impart needed skills, establish catalytic demonstrations and encourage multiplication of successful new activities.
 A plan should be adopted at the forthcoming UN Social Summit for establishing model district programmes in Eastern and Central European countries.
 Plans for transition should cover all of the factors listed above, providing trained personnel to assist in the establishment and initial operation of new institutions and systems.
 7.Plan for institutional development: An assessment of the type and functioning of existing institutions and economic systems should be compiled to identify missing links that need to be provided to support the transition.
 Based on this study, a master plan should be drawn up for establishing the necessary institutions and systems in each country.
 In order to prepare a cadre of managers for private sector industry and institutions, specialized institutes of management should be set up in each country.
 8.Launch a massive programme to impart new skills and attitudes to the population: In countries where private enterprise was extinguished for decades, entrepreneurial, financial and marketing skills can be extremely limited.

Last we heard, Brandon was about 400 miles south working with a friend.
 I wondered what prison would be like for Brandon and wished he were in prison because at least we’d know where he was; he wouldn’t be a drug addict wandering the streets.
 Strange irony, that.
 Strange feeling it stirred in me, realizing that my intervention to keep Brandon out of prison could backfire so terribly.
 Before he got help now, he would need to hit rock bottom.
 Hopefully he’d survive it.
 Then, one day Thomas called.
 Brandon just contacted him from some street corner in a bad part of town outside of San Diego.
 Brandon said he was broke, addicted, alone and ready to commit himself to rehab.
 Thomas said he had dropped what he was doing and was driving directly to find him, as he knew Brandon might change his mind.

The Jeep was gone, of course.
 I wiped away the beginnings of perspiration as I climbed our steps.
 It was still hot enough outside that I knew it was going to be miserable inside.
 By the time I reached the door I was contemplating just finding a decent tree and spending the afternoon outside.
 The sight of a white envelope, barely visible against the off-white door, was enough to drive those thoughts out of my head.
 It had my name on the side that'd been facing the door.
 I pulled it down as I walked inside the house.
 Mom was gone, there wasn't any reason I couldn't read whatever was in the envelope in the living room, but I found myself quickly climbing up our creaky stairs and closing my bedroom door behind me.
 I tore the envelope open and pulled out a piece of heavy paper, almost like parchment.
 The writing was elegant, a kind of flowing script that was different from anything I'd ever seen, but which paled against the sheer artistry of the sigil positioned at the bottom of the note.

In addition, its deployment would always be subject to veto by any of the five permanent members of the Council.
 For both these reasons, it cannot constitute a reliable mechanism for guaranteeing the security of UN member countries.
 Although a strengthening of the UN’s peace-keeping capabilities is highly desirable, it cannot serve as an adequate foundation for a cooperative security system unless the UN’s political structure is radically modified.
 Because it is essentially an addition to national forces rather than a substitute for them, funding will be a perennial difficulty and there will be strong resistance to its expansion on economic grounds.
 Furthermore, as recent events have demonstrated, nations contributing their forces will have a strong propensity to resist their active deployment in situations that involve significant risks.
 Even after the Security Council decided to send a peace-keeping force into Rwanda for strictly humanitarian purposes, none of the leading military powers, with the exception of France, were willing to contribute the modest amount of military equipment urgently needed to protect UN troops.
 Similar efforts are in various stages of maturity for establishing standing international forces at the regional level in Western Europe, Latin America and other places as part of collective security arrangements.
 The limitation of these proposals, like that of NATO and the erstwhile Warsaw Pact, is that they are fundamentally exclusive in nature and could easily become competitive with other forces as the East and West blocs have in the past.
 The strong resentment voiced by Russia at the proposal that some Eastern European nations would join NATO illustrates the danger of expanding exclusive military clubs.
 For NATO to overcome these legitimate concerns, it would have to be thrown open to all nations that seek to join and abide by its charter.

At least Dino is not here to beat me if I fuck this up.
 So in the limo I’m tossing these little white pills in Grandpa’s mouth like candy.
 I have no idea what I am doing, but he is still alive and rambling away in Greek.
 As the limo drives from location to location for this funeral-a-thon, my little brother Harry is watching a helicopter above us.
 At first, it is a welcome distraction, but the chopper keeps showing up.
 We see it through the limo’s glass sunroof, then notice it when we are getting in and out of limo.
 The longer this goes on it becomes an obsession for all of us (except Grandpa who is likely about to overdose on little white pills which have the name of an explosive!)
 At the gravesite ceremony, thank goodness, that frickin’ helicopter we have all been obsessing about is not anywhere to be seen.
 Our limo pulls up followed by a stream of limos and cars.
 A large tent is up over the gravesite and rows of chairs for the service.

 I started to laugh, only to cut the motion short as I realized there was a better than even chance I'd end up crying instead.

War both between and within states has come to involve and affect all of society.
 Infrastructure and production facilities have become a principal target of military action.
 Food supplies are frequently the first major casualty and most lethal weapon.
 A single explosion can paralyze a major metropolis or contaminate an entire region with toxic material, dwarfing the devastation caused by the industrial accidents at Chernobyl and Bhopal.
 The disruption of trade resulting even from regional conflicts such as the Gulf War or the war in Bosnia, impacts not only on the economies of the belligerents, but also on neighbours, trading partners and global economic performance.
 Neither the victor nor the victim can any longer afford to resolve conflicts violently.
 Political states may still be able to survive wars, but developmental achievements can not.
 So long as the benefits of development are confined to one or a few sections of society, the costs of militarization and war may not prevent economic and social progress.
 But when the need is to fulfil the rising expectations of the masses by extending the benefits of development to the entire society – thus enabling the society as a whole to move to the next higher level of collective affluence and fulfilment – every social resource must be garnered and harnessed for this purpose.
 The colossal cost of armaments and the catastrophic destruction of war are incompatible with the achievement of prosperity for all.

"Chicken.
 Is that OK?"
 "Yeah."
 She loved sweet and sour chicken.
 When they sat down, Rick told her, "I want to start with fried rice."
 She laughed.
 "You were serious about being fed!"
 "You'd better believe it."
 She fed him a forkful of fried rice.
 He returned the favor, and within ten minutes the table was covered with grains of rice and bits of food they'd spilled.

 At first I thought it was one of his pranks.
 He’s sneaky when it comes to practical jokes.
 Jim – Don’t I know it, I’ve heard him come up with some twisty and twisted schemes.
 All I can say is that I’m surprised that he’s lived this long.

My head spun.
 Ruby caught my arm to steady me.
 Her smile was strained as she handed me a drink of water.
 Chevelle was near the entrance of the stone room with Anvil and Grey.
 They appeared to be preparing to leave.
 “What’s going on?” I asked.
 “Nothing to worry about,” Ruby assured me.
 “Just a hunting trip.” I was still muddled, but I knew it wouldn’t take three of them to hunt.
 And then I remembered the bits of conversation I’d heard when I woke.
 “Someone’s missing?” I took stock.

The power surged, and Alec's heavy, cool power was joined by something light and laughing.
 Several seconds later, Mallory released Alec with a sigh and fell back in obvious exhaustion.
 Alec watched intently until she shook her head, and then the mask fell for just a second before he locked it back in place, hiding the disappointment that for the slimmest of moments had been plainly written on his expression.
 Mallory reached out, as if to take Alec's hand, but he gently set her hands back on her lap.
 "Nothing's changed.
 We'll just proceed as before.
 Rest now, and should the worst come to pass I'll send Donovan to you."
 A few seconds later Alec and I were outside the cabin, walking back in the direction of the waiting motorcycle.
 I reached out to take his hand, and felt a glimmer of relief when he didn't reject the gesture as he had with Mallory.
 "Alec, was the letter from Donovan?"

You can move it, but only if you’re near.

 Chevelle looked into my eyes, words forgotten.
 I didn’t know what he had seen there, but he blinked, shaking his head.
 “Let’s keep working.” He stepped a few paces away as he spoke.
 “You’ll need to think clearly and stay calm.

Despite enormous expansion of educational and training institutions, most developing countries suffer from a shortage of quality vocational skills among the huge number of people at lower levels of the society who seek desperately to raise their standard of living.
 This shortage retards the growth in productivity and quality needed to meet domestic needs and achieve international competitiveness.
 The technical training in frastructure in these countries should be expanded by the establishment of craft and vocational training institutes at the local level in every community to impart a wide range of basic technical skills.
 A massive programme of basic vocational and skills training should be launched on a parallel with the 100 per cent literacy programmes that are now being promoted by many governments to wipe out rural illiteracy.
 The military in many developing countries possesses the organizational capabilities and experience with intensive training to assist with this task.
 An institutional gap exists in agricultural training systems.
 In most developing countries, agricultural colleges, universities and polytechnics train researchers, government, bank employees and extension officers, but not farmers.
 Producing more food with less water, less chemicals and less soil erosion requires high levels of skill.
 The chain of agricultural training needs to be filled out at the lower level by establishing thousands of village-level farm schools as proposed in the chapter on food security.
 The switch from centrally planned to market-oriented economic systems in Eastern Europe cannot be successful until the population has acquired the skills needed to function effectively in the new economic environment.

He stroked her fingers thoughtfully.
 If she belonged here, he would be pursuing her relentlessly.
 But she wanted to go back to 1927.
 So there was absolutely no point in falling in love with her.
 Marie found herself thinking about Rick all the time that week.
 He was always smiling, always kind and gentle.
 He showed her new things he thought she'd like and took her places and bought her gifts.
 But what she enjoyed most was just being with him.
 He made her feel special.
 And he was protective without making her feel confined.

I don't know what to say.
 Are you sure you want to give it up?"
 Alec looked back up at me, and his eyes were filled with incredible need.
 I was suddenly struck by the similarities to the me he'd painted, and what I saw written on his face.
 It seemed impossible he would be unsure, that a glorious being like him could ever need anything I could provide, but I couldn't deny it was there.
 There was no way of knowing what it was, but I didn't care.
 Whatever it was he needed I wanted to give him.
 I opened my mouth to say as much, but my vocal chords wouldn't cooperate.
 I was still trying to verbalize my feelings, when his free hand came down to my chin and gently pulled it up.
 My heart stuttered and threatened to quit as his lips slowly came down to meet mine.

“I’m sorry.
 Was it an imp?” “No.” I laughed at the strange idea.
 And for no apparent reason, I told him the truth.
 “She died of sorrow.” His brow furrowed.
 We shared the boar and talked further, casually, as if we were old friends.
 He resituated himself on the rock, coming closer to me, and his shirt moved to expose a different color skin where it opened at the chest.
 I reached out to pull it aside and his eyes grew wild at the touch.
 “Your flesh is a different tone here.” He smiled, as if I were being coy.
 “Yes.” “Why?” “Sometimes I work with my shirt on, to avoid the burn of the sun.” “The sun?” He laughed, but then realized I wasn’t joking.
 “It is a tan… from the sun.” He pulled the laces and lifted his shirt over his head, throwing it aside to show me his bare chest.

I probably would've spent the next few minutes refining my arguments for the next time we talked, but the last thing Britney had said finally sank in.
 His sister.
 Rachel was Alec's sister, and he hadn't made a move to save her.
 He hadn't even been willing to let his friends step in and stop the fight.
 I drifted off to History thinking that I would've done almost anything to save my sister.
 It would take a real heartless individual to abandon their own family.
 My anger buffered me just enough to think about Cindi without the usual consequences, but I still wasn't really in top form.
 I was halfway through my class before I realized Mr. Simms had been shooting me dark looks for the last twenty minutes.
 They weren't the obvious nasty looks that kids shoot each other of course.
 They were subtle and infrequent but there was something about the set of his mouth that made it clear he wasn't pleased I was in his class.

We decided we could read a newspaper account and tell Helga we had gone and found plenty to think about.
 But by the evening of the crusade, something like conscience bit us.
 The crusade was downtown at Balboa Stadium, where the Chargers played.
 It seated about 20,000.
 Since we were among the last to straggle in, we climbed to the top.
 From our seats, with a glance behind, we saw the harbor crowded with battleships and carriers.
 In front of us sat a trio of babes, probably still in high school.
 They looked wholesome, with cheeks made rosy from the chill and breeze, and curls that adorned their creamy necks and shoulders.
 Way down on the stage stood three big men.
 Even from afar, they looked like giants.

 It's the small town effect, I think."
 Something about his voice was a little different than normal.
 "You've lived somewhere else, somewhere bigger?"
 The wistfulness was gone; the smile was back full force.
 "Not really.
 I've visited a few larger cities, but never for long enough to get the full feel for what it must be like to live in a Minneapolis or a New York.
 Someday maybe though."
 This time I was going to pry, but he preempted my question.
 "It looks like we'd better be going or we'll both be late."

 “You have heard the voice of the dark god himself.

 “Please, brother,” Qurrah said.
 “I need to know.”
 Harruq stared at the dirt, each breath making his shoulders heave.
 His mind reeled, and for reasons he did not understand, he opened his mouth and said, “That which I fear and desire.
 I have had no questions answered, but I do know this: the time for questions has long ended.”
 Velixar nodded.

He thought that his garden looked rather old-fashioned—maybe the way it had looked in the 1920s, he mused, smiling.
 His mind had been wandering to the 1920s a lot lately.
 He and Sharon had had a good time at Teri’s dance, and the stereotypical costumes—drop-waist dresses, cloche hats, raccoon coats—had made him wonder what life had been like for Marie Tranton before she’d gotten married.
 Had she gone to lots of dances and parties?
 He wondered what radio programs she’d enjoyed and if maybe she’d preferred to read.
 Sighing, Rick rose to go inside.
 He didn’t feel like being alone all day.
 Maybe he’d call Dirk and go play racquetball.
 Or maybe— He stopped and turned around, hearing footsteps.

As if of one mind, they rose together, ignoring any injuries upon them.
 Some hobbled on broken legs while others shambled with twisted and mangled arms.
 The brothers watched as hundreds more lumbered through the still-broken southern gate.
 A few belated alarms cried out from the exhausted guards, but they were too few and too late.
 Unencumbered, the horde of dead marched out to where the necromancer extended his arms to embrace them.
 Harruq and Qurrah watched until the sun rose in the east and all trace of the necromancer vanished.
 “What is it he wanted?” Harruq asked, breaking their long silence.
 “More dead for his army,” Qurrah surmised.
 “No,” Harruq said.
 “With you.”

 “I was a half-ling.,” June corrected me.
 “I’m dead now.
 But I can still speak to you because you have to complete the job I did before with my friends.” “Wow, back up a second,” I said quickly.
 “You’re dead?” She tapped her foot impatiently.

Steed offered Chevelle what was left of the roast and they sat, Chevelle beside me and Steed across from us.
 I picked up the canteen and choked down more wine.
 The evening carried on and though the conversation still held a formal tone, neither man talking of anything personal, they seemed to be getting along.
 I faded in and out of the various discussions, listening occasionally but never talking.
 Steed seemed very aware of me, watching me in a way no one ever had.
 It must have been obvious, because when he excused himself to check the herd, Chevelle studied me, sliding a strand of my now-black hair through his fingers.
 “It suits you.” It was a familiar gesture and it should have made me flinch.
 Maybe it was the wine, but as I looked at him, my anger was fading.
 The way he’d reacted when Fannie had struck me, the caress against my cheek, those were not the actions of a council elder.
 As we sat so near, it was hard to believe the concern wasn’t real.

The most striking testimony to this fact is the history of employment in USA, arguably the country that has most readily and fully adopted new technologies over the past century.
 Employment in manufacturing and mining grew to a peak of about 40 per cent of the workforce after World War II before beginning its downward spiral to 15 per cent by 2000, about the same proportion as in 1850.
 Yet, during this same period total employment in America has expanded phenomenally, from a mere 13 million workers in 1870 to 68 million in 1955 and more than 136 million in 2002.
 In spite of all the automation and all the export of jobs to lower wage economies, the percentage of the American population employed has continued to rise over time.
 Several factors are responsible for this result, among which population growth and technological development are most prominent.
 Rising levels of technological sophistication certainly displace workers in most fields of manufacturing.
 But at the same time they stimulate growth of employment in many different ways – increasing demand for the products thus manufactured by a factor of 10, 100 or even 1000 fold as in the case of automobiles, TVs, cell phones and computers; increasing the demand for research workers to support technological innovation and for teachers to meet the rising demand for education; and rising living standards, which increases consumption of other goods and services due to the falling prices made possible by rising productivity.
 Over the past two decades the US economy lost nearly 4 million manufacturing jobs but added a net 37 million jobs through expansion of the service sector, which now accounts for 84 per cent of total employment.
 It is time that we stop resisting or resenting this trend, but rather strive to adapt by shifting our focus toward those fields of employment which are most directly stimulated by technological innovation.
 Export of commercial services already accounts for 20 per cent of world trade.

 Qurrah did, his eyes red and his face wet.

 The man in black put a hand on either side of Qurrah’s face and drew him close.
 “Become a god among men,” he whispered.
 “Remain faithful to me, and to Karak, and I shall see it come to pass.”
 Qurrah nodded but said nothing.
 Instead, he turned and joined his brother.

In some instances the devastating impact of increasing imports may justify a gradual approach to removing trade barriers.
 However, the overall impact of manufactured exports from developing countries has been vastly exaggerated.
 Exports by the Newly Industrializing Economies to the United States have risen from 1.1 to 2.1 per cent of US GNP over the past decade.
 America’s share of trade with low-wage countries represents only 3 per cent of GDP, compared to 2 per cent in 1960.
 For the OECD as a whole, imports from low-wage countries represent only 1.5 per cent of total expenditure on goods and services.
 On the other hand, there is irrefutable evidence that expanding international trade creates large numbers of jobs, even in high-wage economies.
 The real issue, therefore, is whether the overall balance favours net job creation or net job destruction for each nation and for the global economy.
 On this issue the evidence is clear.
 Protectionism reduces overall economic welfare, often hurting those with the lowest incomes.
 In the long term greater international trade, like technology, expands overall employment opportunities substantially.

 “How do you feel?” he asked.
 “Better.

 Worse because I was fuzzy again, bound.
 He nodded.

He spoke the word with an odd reverence, but they both understood its significance.
 Unlike the humans, the two brothers’ skin was dark and tinged with gray, their ears long and curled to a point.
 They were half-orcs, condemned for the tainted blood coursing through their veins.
 The people of Veldaren hurled the word at them like a dagger, but in truth neither had ever seen a full orc before.
 “Now we’ll finally see,” Qurrah said, “what we are, what we are meant to be.”
 Thousands of orcs spilled into the west, needing no light to see in the darkness.
 They howled and cheered, drums and war chants mixing with the shrieks of the skulls.
 Harruq felt his temples throb.
 A wail rolled over him as a deathly comet swirled about, spotting the two and eying them like prey.
 Try as he might, he couldn’t stop from shaking.

I honestly couldn't think of a less entertaining way to spend an evening, but I wasn't ready to join the dancers.
 Most of them seemed to be rapidly losing key items of clothing, and all of them were dancing so close it was hard to tell where one person ended and the other began.
 As Brandon handed me another cup of beer, which I started slowly pouring out on the ground as soon as his back was turned, the loneliness really started to hit me.
 It would be bearable if I had a friend other than Brandon.
 It might even be fun to sit back and laugh at some of the antics making an appearance as people got more and more wasted.
 Instead I was stone cold sober, and the next best thing to completely friendless.
 About the time Vincent tapped the second keg, Brandon looked over at me and flashed a thoughtful smile.
 I would've said nothing could've made up for the last two hours, but it came remarkably close.
 "I'm sorry, this isn't any fun for you, is it?"
 My listless shrug earned me a chuckle.

 Rick had gotten her the Dragonriders of Pern series, since those books were about a world that was new to all readers and had very few offensive elements.
 She'd wanted some romances, but he was afraid that they'd be too explicit for her.
 And, fortunately, she'd found that she loved the Pern books.

 Jim – Well, he kept on badgering me and asking me how he could make it truly evil, you know Gene, once he gets something into his head he sticks with it until he gets it working, unless it almost kills him.
 Liz – Or until he gets beaten up.
 Jim – That too.
 Liz – So what did you suggest?
 Jim – I told him that calling people at 3 am wasn’t evil.
 Calling people at 3 am long distance and collect is evil.
 I figured that way he would at least stop calling me.
 Liz – Oh, that’s all.
 Wait a minute… How did he get the queen of England’s home phone number?

I tried to place weight on my leg but winced as pain shot up it.
 He kicked the dead Thrasher one more time before sheathing his sword.
 “You know better Jazell then to take on a monster by yourself.
 You never know what kind it is until you have already changed,” he scolded me and I could feel a lecture coming.
 I looked down at leg.
 Claw marks ran up my shin and my blue blood was soaking my pants.
 “I had to Seth; it was heading for my house.
 That made me panic a bit.” “I don’t care Jazell; if I hadn’t been here I would have found you shredded to small pieces.
 All you had to do was send me a quick text and I would have showed up to help.
 But you didn’t.” I sighed in annoyance, not in the mood for this right now.

They both watched him with steady eyes.
 One reached out with a huge paw and dragged the dead bear’s body closer.
 Did it think he was here to steal it?
 The danger of the Dire Cats was crystal clear.
 He had not even heard them fighting, and yet they had killed a Dire Bear while Rodregas and the others slept!
 The good news was that they both seemed very full, and if anything, had a sleepy look to them.
 Rodregas guessed that he had awakened them from a nap.
 Rodregas had to remind himself that he needed to develop an understanding with the lionesses.
 Predators like them worked on a very simple alpha relationship; the strong ruled.
 They were Dire beasts, but he was the equivalent of a Celestial Beast.

The bad news is that it is up to each competing squire to have his own equipment for the other three competitions.
 The sword and the shield competition are limited to light armor.
 You will be at a disadvantage.
 The real problem is going to the completion with the lance and the mace.
 Both have no limit to the armor; and of course, the lance is a mounted competition.
 “You should see some of the horses!” said Imeralda.
 “They are beautiful.” She smiled but at her words Doi’van clearly did not see beautiful animals but a problem.
 “She is correct; most have trained war horses and a few are Dire Steeds.
 I will be honest Rodregas, I am not sure that this will work.
 These warriors are trained in the use of the lance and their war horses will negate your personal advantage in physical might, as your horse is a trail mount.” Doi’van paused and said, “But, the real problem is that you are without plate armor.

My dad thought knowing how to dance would make my first dance easier.
 It turned out to be a complete waste of time.
 Nobody asked me to dance and his lessons wouldn't have helped even if they had.
 Still, now I wish I'd done a better job of learning."
 Alec nodded, but there was a distracted air to the gesture.
 I waited while we made another quarter of a journey, him gracefully, me not quite so much, around the floor, before opening my mouth to speak, but he beat me to it.
 "I don't suppose either of us talk about our dads much.
 I'm not pushing, but if you ever need to talk about him, about what happened, I'll listen.
 I'll even try to suppress the natural male instinct to present advice or solutions."
 I missed another step, but I wasn't fighting off a panic attack, I was just shocked that his words hadn't triggered one.

 Liz – What did he say?

 Liz – I told you that you should have talked to him sooner.
 Jim – He said the same thing,  at least after he figured out who I was.

Here’s the thing, Dad..  That’s the order we recorded them in.
 See, we were naives, kids.
 We just did what was natural, we didn’t know from creating a suite, or anything pretentious like that.
 Man, we just wanted to get our chops in, create a little noise.
 That’s raw sound on that record, see, that’s live.
 None of it was fiddled with, enhanced, whatever.
 Except that playful tape loop, and that fade-out on “For Kim,” that’s just us, beating our brains out in that little studio, high on bennies.
 “For Kim, Because it Went by So Fast”---we worked our asses off to get that one right.
 I don’t know what was wrong really.
 It was a song I’d written right before we went into the studio, so we’d never done it live—maybe that was the reason we struggled with it.

So for all I know I could have eaten nothing but paint at that time,
 Johnny – It would explain a lot if you had.
 Jim – I just found out that Liz has feelings for me.
 And why the hell was I the last person on the planet to find out?
 Johnny – I think it’s because you ate lead paint as a child.
 Eugene – I’d have to agree with Johnny, lead paint isn’t good for you.
 Jim – You knew that Elizabeth felt something for me, and you didn’t say anything, what kind of friend are you?
 Johnny – Maybe he’s Elizabeth’s friend more than he’s your friend.
 If that’s the case he might have wanted to spare her from a lifetime of living with you.
 Jim – What do you know about it?

"Rachel, my life doesn't work like that.
 Even if I could afford a trip like that, my mom would never let me go.
 She's only an absentee parent when I need her."
 Rachel's soft blue eyes got really wide as she recoiled slightly.
 Whatever she was about to say was preempted as we were both thrown forward in our seats.
 James slid the car through a one-eighty turn that left us facing the direction we'd just come from, only a couple of feet from the start of our lane.
 "You're not making her walk!"
 It was obvious that whatever magical ability had allowed Rachel to face down the larger boy wasn't working anymore.
 He looked like he was set for a monster fight.
 "I'm not washing my car again."

I stared off into the trees, waiting for Seth's cue to tell them about the ghost kids.
 Seth raised his hand, signaling for us to stop.
 He put a finger to his lips and pointed in front of him.
 I crept up and peered at where he was pointing.
 A bunch of dwarves and tall, muscular men crowded around something.
 The men had double swords sheathed on their back, long ears, and long black hair.
 They were wearing some type of combat boots and thick coats.
 One of them moved and I saw a tied dragon staked to the ground.
 It continued to try to stand but it seemed to weak and fell back down.
 I heard Emily gasp in horror and I felt the same way.

Guilting him into helping me more just felt wrong.
 He captured me in his iron grip, stopping me from getting up and running away.
 "Adriana Paige, it isn't that I don't want to be with you.
 I want it more than anything else right now.
 That's why I'm not sure it's such a good idea."
 His face had somehow gotten so close to mine that I could see his eyes, and they were dead serious.
 I'd never noticed how clear his eyes were.
 They were the purest blue I'd ever seen, and looking into them was like trying to plumb the depths of a bottomless spring.
 I could see further into him than I ever could with Brandon, and there wasn't any deception there.
 I nodded, and then buried my face against his chest as I cried myself out.

His arms, his chest, his face: it all bled.

Should you or your dominant wish to push things further, I guarantee that your heart will decorate the floor before he can come to your aid."
 Brandon stopped moving as Alec's words carried to him.
 He was probably weighing odds and tabulating the probable cost of the various courses of action available to him.
 Vincent's life was likely a relatively small component in the grand equation.
 Dominic's presence as she stepped around the corner seemed to be the deciding factor.
 Brandon gave us another lazy smile as he stepped slowly backwards to give us more room.
 Alec's tone was still conversational as he shoved Vincent backwards and allowed his hand to return to normal.
 "The harassment of my people stops now."
 "Now why would we do a thing like that when we all know you're a dead man?"
 Dominic stopped just outside of what I was starting to understand was pouncing range for people who happened to have supernatural strength, as Alec gave Brandon a cold smile.

The fact she's also a submissive only makes things worse."
 It was terribly vindictive, and wonderfully appealing.
 I felt a smile tugging at the ends of my mouth.
 "She won't eat me if I do that?"
 His chuckle pulled my smile wider.
 "No.
 If you're really worried about it just make sure that one of the others are in the room at the same time with you."
 "Now that has some real possibilities."
 I was still rolling the thought around in my mind when the bell rang and Alec pulled me to my feet.
 We swapped out our books and were halfway to Spanish when Vincent and Brandon strode into view.

Just trust me a little."
 She didn't want to.
 But he was right--she didn't know how to get home.
 Slowly she rose, not taking the hand he extended but following him inside.
 "This is a microwave oven," he told her, patting a white and brown box.
 "It cooks things really fast--it can heat something like rice in less than a minute."
 When he saw her incredulous stare, he opened the refrigerator and took out a bowl of mixed vegetables.
 "Feel."
 She touched the cold food.
 "How does the box work?"

Harruq clanged his swords together, showering the ground with sparks.
 His armor shimmered as his anger grew.
 “Pretenders with wonderful toys,” the elf continued, eyeing Harruq’s blades.
 “Toys I will take from your dead bodies.”
 He leapt down the stairs in a single bound.
 His feet hardly touched before he was vaulting over a red silk couch to land before the fireplace.
 He drew an ornate sword that hung over the fireplace, letting the scabbard fall to the floor.
 The blade gleamed in the firelight, impossibly sharp and deadly.
 “I have killed a hundred like you,” Ahrqur said.
 “And I hope to kill a thousand just like you,” Harruq said, clanging his swords together one more time before lunging across the room.

Or maybe she lived a nightmare and only hung on so long for her children.
 I was able to piece together some things about her life.
 She didn’t go into much detail about the magic, which I would have found useful, just that she practiced often and was apparently unusually talented.
 But she did tell more about her duties in the castle.
 Her father must have ruled a vast kingdom.
 And she was his second.
 I heard someone in the front room and knew I had read through the night again.
 I hurriedly slipped the book into my pack and pretended to sleep.
 Ruby was waking me minutes later to head out to the ridge.

While at a glance this could be taken to mean we should simply believe that Jesus existed, it doesn’t.
 Because “believe in” denotes more than credulity.
 “Believe in” means to fully trust.
 And here we’re not called to believe in “Him” but to believe in His name.
 As “name” in the Biblical context refers to character, John is calling us to fully trust in the character of Jesus Christ.
 When we believe in, fully trust certain people, if we have any sense, we will follow their example and not only take what advice they offer but actively seek every piece of wisdom we can wrest out of them.
 If I want to become a baseball star, I should look for a coach or mentor whose character and lessons I can believe in.
 If I believe in Mother Teresa, I should read about her and talk to those who knew her and attend to whatever I learn.
 To the extent that we follow Christ’s example, give of our selves, our time and resources to help people in need, allow time away from the crowds to contemplate and pray, put aside our self concerns and turn to concern for others, our minds and hearts get invaded and possessed by the Holy Spirit.
 And in that condition, the world transforms before our eyes.

If they were this worked up about the fight, it was a good thing I didn't share any other classes with Alec.
 The rest of the school must be three or four times as bad.
 Sketching helped block out all of the inane conversation that'd taken over the other corner of the room.
 It was amazing how easily I was able to zone out while drawing.
 Once again, I didn't try to guide my hand, just let my subconscious create a horizon and start fleshing out a body of water and droopy trees around it.
 The sound of a hand coming down hard on a desk pulled me from my refuge.
 "I told you all to keep it to a dull roar.
 I want everyone back to your seats."
 A couple people looked like they wanted to give the sub a hard time, but these were all the kids who were hoping to make it into the top ten percent of their graduating class.
 None of them really had a disobedient bone in their body.

Then I drove to a Jack in the Box on the coast road and found Kris there, in a Ford, hanging onto my cousin Jill’s boyfriend, Jimmy Dixon.
 Jimmy was one tough fellow.
 According to rumor, while fighting in the Golden Glove tournament, he had knocked another light-heavyweight into a coma.
 An equally tough surfer, Butch Van Artsdalen, rode shotgun.
 I strode to their car, jammed my head through rolled-down shotgun side window and stared at Kris.
 “You babysitting these guys?” “It didn’t work out,” she said.
 Butch grabbed the door handle, but Jimmy told him to be cool, and he motioned me around to his side of the car.
 After I staggered there, I lashed him with a string of curses for two-timing my cousin and stealing my girl.
 And I gave notice that if Kris didn’t get out and come with me, I was going to pluck them both out of the car and so on.
 Jimmy sat rubbing his temples.

Davis grabbed her arm, pulling her around to face him.
 "Don't talk to me like that!"

 "You deserved it."
 She glared at him, trying to wrench her arm free.
 "You're hurting me."
 "Maybe that will remind you not to talk back to me."
 He released her with a slight shove and turned to stalk off.
 Marie's anger dissolved into pain, and she hurried to her room to hide her tears.
 She and Davis had been betrothed for just over five weeks, and during the last couple of weeks he'd lost his temper with her twice.

The midgets could take the seven dwarves unarmed and surprised.
 Jim – Yeah, you’re right, now if it was the dwarves from The Hobbit that’d be a different story.
 The Seven Dwarves just have too many neuroses to deal with on top of a pack of angry bloodthirsty midgets.
 I concede, the dwarves never stood a chance, and I knew it from the get go.
 Johhny – (Sneering) Then why did you back them then if they can’t win.
 Jim – Cause of that song they sing, the midgets can’t touch the dwarves in the realm of singing those cheerful and catchy coming home from work songs.
 They have heart!
 If this were like a battle of the bands, the dwarves would grind the midgets to dust, and then dance on the dust.
 Johnny – You’re an idiot, I can’t believe that we’re related.
 Jim – Another pleasant mood I see.

Maybe he wasn't feeling well.
 Taking his hand as they returned to their blanket, she asked, "Are you feeling all right, Rick?"

 "It's still early."
 "We've been here several hours already.

With magic, he caused them to go into heat.
 It was known to be very difficult to affect Dire beasts with magic, and his success had shown his power and accomplishment as a mage.
 Rodregas had regretted not being on duty when the Dire Cats were staked out on the roof.
 Rodregas had heard from the other guards that the cats were in heat, and as Ravenhurr had hoped, a Celestial Lion had sensed their presence while the lion was out during the full moon with the Wilde Hunt, and the great lion had spent the last few nights doing his best to impregnate both of the female beasts.
 The whole keep could hear the wild rutting going on.
 Ravenhurr then had goats released on the roof and the Celestial Lion had gorged himself on them when he had finished rutting.
 The well-satisfied beast lay limp, sleeping, confident in his celestial power, and oblivious to his surroundings.
 He lied unbound, as required by the ceremony.
 Rodregas assumed some subtle magic had been used to influence the beast to sleep in just the right spot.
 The unlikely success of having an actual celestial animal as part of the ceremony had put Ravenhurr into an unusually good mood.

“Are you all right?” Rodregas asked.
 Doi’van nodded and then said, “Let’s get out of the chamber.” Rodregas nodded, as he wanted to check on Imeralda.
 Doi’van seemed to have his balance back.
 Rodregas wondered if Doi’van had lost his balance because he had been trying to fly instead of walk.
 As they stepped out of the room of Infernal sigils and carefully closed the door behind them, Doi‘van still seemed unsteady and Rodregas wondered if his own experiences had prepared him more naturally for this.
 Rodregas had changed bodies before.
 “Doi’van, why don’t you sit down and rest for a second?
 I will check on Imeralda,” Doi’van nodded his thanks and sank down on the floor.
 Doi’van seemed to need to think more than rest, but either way Rodregas made sure he was ok and then went to check on Imeralda.
 He hoped she had not touched the One Tree.

I walked downstairs as the eastern sky was just starting to change colors.
 Mom was already gone.
 The message board was conspicuously empty, so she was either still frustrated with me, angry at our hopeless situation, or wrapped back up in her quest to become a renowned photographer.
 Britney picked me up on schedule and I somehow made it through my first two classes.
 Mrs. Sorenson was still out to prove to everyone I was an idiot, and Heathcliff was still a psychopath despite Mr. Whethers' best efforts to explain the character's motivation.
 Math was actually the high point of the morning.
 Mrs. Campbell was smart enough to put Britney off in a corner surrounded by the kind of kids she'd never even consider talking to under normal circumstances.
 Not having Britney distract me all hour would have been a blessing by itself, but things got even better when Mrs. Campbell complimented me on the homework I handed in.
 "Most excellently done, Miss Paige.

 "To work?"

 Alec bowed his head in acquiescence, grasping my hand as he turned to leave.

But her eagerness highlighted to him that the body she wanted to touch was not really his.
 It was the body of Gerald, not Rodregas.
 Her body was everything that he had thought it would be, both wonderfully hard and lush.
 To say she was the most beautiful woman he had ever enjoyed touching was a ridiculous understatement.
 Imeralda reached up to his neck and pulled herself up on top of his lap.
 She wrapped her legs around him and hoisted herself up like she was climbing the trunk of a tree.
 He had wanted to take his time and explore her with his hands and lips, but clearly she was in no mood for foreplay.
 Rodregas in turn was in no mood to stop her now that his own passion was building, and there was no reason to think that they would not be repeating this experience.
 There would be other times to explore her.
 Now was time to give in to their most primal needs.

Aurelia tried to say something, tried to comfort him, but no noise came from her throat.

 “No!” Harruq shouted.
 He pulled out one of his healing potions, yanked off the cork, and forced the contents down Aurelia’s throat.
 The elf gagged, retching up half of it onto her neck and chest.
 Harruq got out his last potion but could not open it for the shaking of his hands.
 Desperate, he put it down, picked up one of his swords, and shattered the top of the vial.
 He flung the potion back to Aurelia’s mouth, nearly shredding her lower lip on the broken glass.
 More of the silvery-blue liquid poured down her throat.
 Harruq sat there, clutching her hands in his and waiting.

For one, I had lived on my own since I was fifteen.
 I didn’t have any choice after the abuse I had endured.
 As far back as I could remember everything seemed to go wrong for me and I was fighting an uphill battle.
 I put myself through my last years of high school, had no college education, almost everyone I knew abused drugs; I had essentially raised myself from puberty and I obviously didn’t know what I was doing.
 I had made far more mistakes than my ego would allow me to acknowledge.
 I guess this was my bottom.
 Moving back to Sacramento would be the first time in many years I would live with my mom, who had recently become a widow.
 She needed my help sorting things out, because she was left with a lot of complex issues after Dino’s suspicious death.
 The story goes that Dino was at an associate’s home helping him cut some hedges.
 He cut into a bush that apparently had a yellow jacket nest in it and they swarmed him and stung him to death.

 She slid over beside him, her long hair cascading toward his face.
 “Oh, but I think you are,” she said.
 “Since you’re down here, how about I—”
 “I’m fine.

 The elf smirked and trotted away.
 “Hey, Aurelia,” Harruq said.
 “Yes, Harruq?” She turned around.
 Harruq tapped his fingers against the hilts of his swords and glanced about the clearing.

The official figure is around 6.4 per cent in the United States, but the actual number, including those who have given up seeking jobs, is probably above 10 per cent.
 More than 35 million Americans, constituting 14 per cent of the population, are living on incomes below the poverty line, including 30 per cent of all blacks and Hispanics.
 Western European unemployment rates are at the highest level in 30 years.
 They are projected soon to reach 12 per cent or 18 million people and remain high throughout the decade, prompting the outgoing European Union President, Jacques Delors, to call employment Europe’s ‘Achilles heel’.
 Youth unemployment rates (aged 16–19) in the European Community average nearly 20 per cent and nearly 50 per cent of the unemployment is long-term (more than one year).
 The emerging situation poses a challenge to the European concept of the welfare state.
 Employment in Eastern Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union has been severely disrupted by the break-up of COMECON, the dissolution of the USSR and the movement of these countries from centrally planned to market economies.
 From the beginning of 1990 to March 1992, registered unemployment grew from 100,000 to over 4 million and it has continued to rise steeply since then.
 The unemployment rate for ten Eastern European countries now averages around 17 per cent.
 Recent projections indicate that jobless ness in Russia could reach 15 million persons or 18 per cent of the work-force in the near future.

 Something to explain why you, a man self-professed to not being interested in art, is so knowledgeable about Miss Struan.

Finally the crew is all present behind the store, and the review of protocol and procedure began as it did before.
 New officers are in amongst familiar faces from the prior attempt.
 I find myself less interested in their chat as I mentally prepare myself for the task at hand.
 I am given the weapons and shots fired instructions again.
 In my usual humorous deflection of discomfort, I quip that the last time I met Ashley it was a “happy ending” and I would like the same result this time.
 The officers are un-amused.
 The officers are sent to stake out a nearby drugstore.
 My story to the drug dealers will be that I will fill the prescription there and meet her in that parking lot as it is a stone’s throw within the county line which they want the bust in.
 One problem I point out is that the drugstore will be closed in a few minutes but they send the crew that direction for feedback on the location.
 The call comes back and the parking lot is virtually empty of cars leaving no cover for the officers to hide.

I would need Brandon to assist me with current drug terms.
 What did an Oxy look like?
 What milligram size I should say I have?
 Brandon told me that the easiest way to buy pills is from people who are prescribed them for chronic pain and intentionally demand more than they need from their doctors so they can resell them at an enormous profit.
 Brandon told me that the Holy Grail for an Oxy dealer was to find an “old guy with a script” (prescription); so I decided this would be who I would become.
 I went to a Wal-Mart and purchased a pre-paid cellular phone that I would use as my undercover phone.
 I didn’t need my last name popping up on a caller I.D.
 I nicknamed the phone my “crack-berry.” After getting crucial information and doing a bit of research, I found the Craigslist classified advertisement with a picture of a young blond girl offering massages with a contact phone number that matched the drug dealer Steve’s number.
 The pictures in the ad were racy and the price per session was about twice the normal cost for such services.
 I called to set up a “massage.” I told her I got massages often for my ailing back but I thought it would be fun to get a massage from a pretty young lady.

“Yes.” “I’m sorry you didn’t get home.” Tears filled her eyes.
 “I tried so hard.
 I have on all my 1927 clothes, and I didn’t think about anything but what’s going on at home.” “I’m sorry, sweetheart.”  He led her into the kitchen.
 “But maybe that’s not all there is to it.
 I looked at some of the chapters you’d marked.
 One of them says that the relative positions of the sun and moon and earth are important.” “Yes, I saw that.
 I tried to figure it out, and it seems like the best time would be in September.
 But I can’t wait until September!
 And what if that book isn’t right?” Rick hugged Marie, wiping away her tears.
 He led her inside and made her breakfast, which she barely touched.

The whole greenhouse was filled with them, and suddenly I couldn't ignore the significance of the circular signature on the paintings anymore.
 I hurried outside, looked desperately from side to side for some hint of which way he'd gone, and then headed off to the right towards the sound of shattering pottery.
 Just before I was about to give up hope of finding him, I heard another crash and turned into a small grotto.
 The sight of rock walls nearly covered by a swath of greenery caused me to pull up with a suddenness that only barely saved me from tumbling into the small reflecting pool off to one side.
 Alec froze at my appearance, a large planter that easily weighed as much as I did dangling from one hand.
 The shards of pottery strewn about the grotto answered any questions I might have had regarding its imminent fate.
 Neither of us moved for several seconds, and then he turned towards me with a glare.
 "Go away!"
 The command was so forceful it was almost more than I could do to stop myself from turning and running away in terror, but I held my ground.
 "Leave.

Obviously I was blinded to the truth, but now I it, as my father had always insisted.
 My biggest failure in life was not having listened to his wise words.
 But I have paid for the arrogance of ignoring his wisdom with my very youth.
 You’re all going to hell.
 I won’t bother praying for you because it wouldn’t help.
 Now I need to spend the rest of my life scouring my soul clean of the taint that you have put on it.
 I hate you for what you are.
 I hate you for what you’ve done to me.
 You are all dead to me.

I was completely lost by the time we came around a corner and my inferior eyes were finally able to see the first hints of light up ahead.
 Alec slowed, to prolong the suspense as we got closer.
 Even so, it was only a few more steps before the grotto materialized out of the darkness before us.
 I'd thought it'd been breathtaking two weeks ago bathed in the light of the full moon.
 I'd been amazed at its lush beauty the couple of times I'd snuck back during the daylight.
 Neither of those compared to what greeted me now.
 Soft light came from dozens of floating lamps that'd been placed in the pool, all of which gave off an aching, white luminescence that seemed perfectly matched to the brilliant white of the rose petals scattered over the surface of the water.
 It wasn't until we got closer that I could make out the purple edging to the petals.
 "Lagrimas."
 Alec's voice was husky.

While that is what his heart hoped for he was not sure if it was the smartest move.
 When they were working on the tack for the horses, he went ahead and asked.
 “Imeralda, I want to make sure you want to continue with us.
 I mean I love to travel with you, but while Doi’van and I are warriors, when you joined us it was only as a travel companion.
 If you want to stay with the village or stay with Jordaan I will understand.
 You know that by now they will be hunting us, if not because of Ravenhurr’s death, than because of the missing Immortal Guards.” “You know that I probably killed more slavers with the Black Yew bow than either you or Doi’van right?” asked Imeralda with a snort.
 “Your abilities are not of question,” Rodregas responded.
 “Your abilities as a Forest Nymph and as an archer make you a very deadly woman.
 As you gain control over your magical powers you will only become more dangerous.
 The question is whether you want to fight?” Imeralda nodded and she hesitated.

--@ Chapter 15 My alarm pulled me out of the strangest night of sleep I'd ever experienced.
 Maybe I'd just been overtired, or possibly the strange, symbol on the note, inked into the place where a signature normally would've been, had reminded me of the other truly alien experience so far in my life.
 Whatever the reason, it felt like I'd spent all night on the edge of one of the incredible, vivid dreams.
 I kept catching glimpses of the characteristic soft glow out of the corner of my eye, but hadn't ever actually slipped into a full-blown dream.
 It'd left me feeling very unsatisfied.
 I rolled over and pulled the note out from its hiding place in my dresser.
 I had the words memorized already; the symbol was what I wanted now.
 The note was proof of the existence of our benefactor, but the sigil on the bottom of the page was a clue to his identity.
 It was incredibly intricate and completely different than anything I'd ever seen.
 Once again I traced the sharp edges and smooth swirls with my eyes, marveling at the way it hinted at further complexity lurking just out of sight.

I was suddenly furious.
 She’d poisoned me and now this.
 I wanted to burn her right then and there.
 I caught Chevelle’s expression as I glared at her.
 He had seen what she was doing, knew her motives most likely, but I could tell he thought it had worked.
 He thought I was jealous.
 Perfect.
 I smelled something odd and glanced down.
 The meat I was holding had burnt in my hand.
 I cursed, dropping it onto the plate.

He'd give anything to keep her here with him, to marry her and make love to her and spend the rest of his life with her.
 Remembering that she’d said she liked being kissed on the neck, he moved to press his lips to her neck, kissing, nibbling, sucking.
 Marie gasped, threading her fingers into his hair.
 His hands slid down her back, pulling her hard against him, reminding her of how he'd pinned her against his car last night.
 Moaning at the pleasure of the contact, she wrapped her arms around him, wanting to get even closer to him.
 Rick covered her mouth with his again, his kiss so hot and thorough and demanding that it elicited more moans from her.
 He ended the embrace with a series of quick, hard kisses and then eased his hold on her, panting.
 Marie started to reach for him again, but then her eyes narrowed.
 Pushing against his chest so hard that he stumbled back, she whirled and stormed off into the fog.
 How dare he!

'Truck' turned out to be an understatement.
 I'd marveled more than once since getting to Utah, at just how big some of the pickup trucks I saw driving around were.
 It seemed like nobody was willing to drive anything around the way it came off of the showroom floor.
 Everything had bigger wheels, and suspension that lifted it up several inches.
 Vincent's truck had more in common with the beasts in monster truck rallies than it did with the souped-up vehicles I'd seen driving around town.
 The tires were the biggest I'd seen on anything outside of a tractor, and the lift kit on it was so outrageously tall that I was pretty sure someone was going to have to lift me into the cab.
 By myself it was going to take a rope and climbing shoes.
 Of course it was black.
 I couldn't imagine Vincent in anything other than a black vehicle.
 Predictably, Vincent was rubbing down his vehicle, but the exercise seemed more targeted to giving him a chance to walk around with his shirt off than it did with cleaning up the already immaculate truck.

When it does come, that means war is on the horizon.
 Our glorious time has almost arrived.”
 Raising a pale hand, he dismissed them.
 Qurrah turned to leave, but Harruq lingered.
 “Master,” he asked, “when this fight starts, which side will we be on?”
 His brother narrowed his eyes, knowing exactly why the question was asked.
 Velixar, however, seemed either not to know or not to care.
 “If the elves win, Vaelor will have no choice but to leave them be.
 The assault of my orcs has weakened his army.
 They cannot suffer any more losses.

I felt tears start to gather at the corner of my eyes as I remembered all of the good times our family had spent together there.
 It was like being immersed in everything I'd loved only to have it evaporate when I went to grab my surroundings.
 "Hey, that's really pretty good.
 Is that a real place?"
 I nodded, hoping Alec would take the hint implied in my silence.
 I should have known better.
 "What's it called?"
 The name slid out of me almost of its own accord.
 "Monster Lake."
 Every single birthday I could remember had involved some kind of trip out to Monster Lake.

I'd seen plenty of girls try and warn off potential competition, but I'd never seen an expression that intense.
 Despite my earlier resolve, I couldn't help myself.
 I veered further away from the pair as some primitive, survival-minded part of my subconscious sought to create a buffer between me and the girl who looked ready to rip out my throat.
 I'd gone far enough I couldn't see either of them, but it honestly felt like Jasmin watched me all the way until I managed to make it safely out of sight.
 I'd read stories where people claimed to have felt someone's gaze trying to bore a hole in their back, but this was the first time I'd ever experienced it for myself.
 I hadn't even believed it was possible, but the pins and needles I'd felt starting the second she'd looked up hadn't disappeared until I put a brick wall between us.
 Biology would've been unpleasant even without everything else that was going on.
 The air conditioning was out to part of the building, and Mrs. Sorenson's classroom was one of the ones that apparently were going to go without until they got the regulator or switcher, or whatever it was, fixed.
 I bowed out of our little competition even earlier than usual.
 I probably should have stayed in the game longer, should have kept answering questions until she came up with a real stumper, but I wasn't in the mood.

His pelvic bones stuck out reminiscent of a dead animal’s carcass on the roadside.
 He looked like one of the horrid pictures you see of a concentration camp victim.
 Oxy is considered synthetic heroin, and sometimes referred to as “hillbilly heroin,” as powerful and addictive a drug as you will find anywhere on the street.
 Children, however, never learn from their parent’s I-told-you-sos.
 He was like a sick animal and we just tried to keep fluids in him and listen to the doctors who guided our effort.
 After the initial detox period, we used professional grade drug tests and surprised him with them.
 He always had an excuse for why he couldn’t pee.
 I would hand him a bottle of water and tell him I would wait.
 He was never truly clean.
 When he slept, I went into the bedroom to see if his chest was inflating with air to assure me he was still alive.

Chevelle glanced at me occasionally but kept himself busy around the fire.
 Steed still played with his feather, eventually entertaining me with it.
 It spun toward me and turned down, tickling my arm and then my nose.
 I giggled despite my wariness, and reached up to rub my nose where the plume had brushed it.
 I noticed the map on my palms.
 “What about spells?” He eyed my hands.
 “Been working spells?” “Not on purpose.” He smiled.
 “Yes, spells can be dangerous.” “Yes,” I agreed, “but why do you need words for spells and not magic?” “A spell can be left, set with a trigger, or larger than your magic.
 They are complicated and wicked things.
 And the ancient language is… tricky.

Van’dret hurried through the open doors before the guard changed his mind.
 He normally found the sight of the Immortal Guards reassuring; the great sigil warriors were sworn to the protection of Immortalist, like himself, but he knew these two would cut him down like a common pauper if they sensed he was a danger to their Master.
 There was a short hallway leading from the doors with slim white columns on each side of the hallway, in between each column hung great pieces of art; paintings, sculptures and even a small wall hanging with amazing vibrant colors with a strange abstract design were all preserved in the space.
 Van’dret was a man of some refinement and appreciation for art, and he wished he had dared to stop and inspect the pieces; they had to be some of the greatest art works in the Realm to be so on display where only those who had been invited to a private meeting with Taiga would see them.
 However Van’dret dared to do nothing more than glance at them as he hurried forward.
 It would not be smart to make the Guild Dealer wait for even a moment.
 The Guild Dealer Taiga was not such a common man that he did his work from a desk; his desires and commands came during parties and social events.
 However, if you were truly honored, though personal invitations to dine with him in his personal solar overlooking his city you would get told his wishes.
 As Van’dret stepped through the arch he was struck by the bare simplicity of the solar.
 The city known as the Menagerie of Sky, Earth and Water that Taiga ruled and had created over the centuries was a lush place, full of pleasures and growing things.

 Their words trailed off once they were close enough to see clearly.

“We’ll both go,” she pushed, forcing a polite tone.
 The rest of the group was quiet, watching us, and Ruby eyed Steed as we turned and headed toward the house.
 As soon as we were out of earshot, though I was still being dragged by the arm, I asked Chevelle, “Did something happen with the twins?” Ruby laughed.
 We both stared at her.
 “Twins,” she scoffed.
 “Right, well, you know what I mean,” I said, embarrassed.
 Chevelle’s tone softened.
 “No.
 Everything is fine.” Ruby chimed in, “It is fine,” and I was knew it was intended for him.
 He relaxed his grip on my arm and slowed our pace as he directed an almost imperceptible nod at Ruby.

I would think that I would take on a minor sigil or two.
 I am a great warrior, but I like to learn new things and I would like to have sufficient magic to be able to learn spells.” Rodregas nodded.
 Doi’van’s response would have surprised him before, but he had learned much of the thoughtful Hellborn in their time together.
 When one looked at him and how powerfully built he was, it was incredible to imagine what he could do on the battlefield with a greater sigil added to his power.
 He would be a true daemon on the battlefield.
 But while Doi’van loved his strength, he also loved his intelligence.
 In comparison, Rodregas was less interested in exploring learning as he was about what he could do as a warrior and carrying out his duty.
 “Well,” Rodregas said, “I don’t think we are going to have any options for sigils for now.
 Let us continue to learn what we can of battle and of magic.
 If we are lucky we can worry about more if we survive our first strike at the Immortalists.” The next morning, during his meditation, Rodregas realized that it was time for action.

 Harruq sheathed the swords and clipped them to his belt.
 He knelt as his head swirled.
 “Thank you, master.”
 “None are more deserving,” Qurrah said, putting an arm on his brother’s shoulder.
 “There is one, and it is you, Qurrah,” Velixar said.
 He pulled out one item more before closing the chest and shrinking it back to its original size.
 In his hand remained a long black whip that curled about as if alive.
 “Weapons may not be your preference, but I trust you will find some use for this.”
 As both brothers watched, the whip burst into flame.

I wanted to say something equally witty, but his shirt did wonderful, probably illegal things to his gray eyes, and his perfectly straight teeth were parted in a friendly grin that couldn't possibly be meant for me.
 I managed a feeble grin before the silence stretched too far towards becoming uncomfortable, but it was a pathetic attempt.
 Brandon gently released my shoulders and detoured around me with a grace that should have looked unnatural on a boy, but which somehow exuded more masculinity than any four boys I'd known back home.
 Britney shot me an envious look and then turned and stalked through an open doorway.
 I should have been worried I was upsetting my only 'friend'.
 Failing that, I should at least be mad she was being so unreasonable, but my racing heart brushed those feelings away.
 Other than a persistent, imaginary tingling along my shoulders I was strangely numb inside as I followed her into the tutoring room.
 There were more kids inside than I'd expected, enough that a normal room would've felt crowded, but this wasn't a normal room.
 Someone had knocked down a wall or two, creating a space that was strangely welcoming, despite obviously being meant for academic pursuits.
 A large number of rectangular tables were scattered about the room, situated so that the two people sitting at them would feel relatively isolated.

Then, the next revelation hit him; maybe the Celestial Gods had answered his prayers.
 He had promised the Gods that if he lived, it would become his sworn duty to take down the Immortalists.
 Rodregas’ new heart seemed to stop for a moment at that thought and a chill ran down his body.
 There were supposed to be well over a hundred Immortalists in the Eastern Realms, each one incredibly powerful.
 What had happened today was pure luck and unlikely to be repeated.
 Trying to tear apart the Immortalists and their powerful guild was a near impossible task.
 Ravenhurr had been known as a powerful Immortalist, but nothing compared to Guild Master Oreintvenir or the Immortalist Guild Dealer Taiga.
 They had been slowly rising in power for centuries on their path to true godhood.
 Rumor was that the Guild Master (and maybe Taiga as well) was close to ascension to true godhood.
 Only two Immortalists had ever succeeded in this task.

Democratization of the UN: The phenomenal advance of Europe’s multi-dimensional unification is a clear indication that in future international institutions will play a more important role than national governments.
 But this can happen only to the extent that these institutions are living proponents of democratic functioning and individual freedom.
 Ten years ago ICPF called for the democratization of the United Nations by abolition of the veto power in the Security Council, induction of new members to make that body more representative, and establishment of democratically-elected representative government as an essential condition for membership or active participation in the UN system.
 The nexus between democracy and prosperity is undeniable.
 The democratic revolution that has so effectively penetrated Eastern Europe in recent years and extended its roots in other regions must be taken to its logical conclusion at the level of nations and at the level of international institutions.
 World Peace Army: The most far-sighted of ICPF’s proposals sought to evolve a practical mechanism to promote the objectives of cooperative security and democratic freedom.
 It called for the establishment of a World Peace Army, to be constituted by and open to all democratic countries willing to renounce the right to aggression against other nations and willing to contribute personnel and resources to an international multilateral military force capable of defending its members from external threats.
 Such a mechanism, so long as it is inclusive, would provide a real and viable alternative to national militarization, whether or not it was constituted by or within the UN system.
 The success of NATO in maintaining peaceful relations among the democratic states of Western Europe and North America for more than half a century is a viable model which is limited primarily by the exclusivity of its membership.
 The recent measures taken by the European Union to constitute a European Army are evidence of the practicality of establishing a similar mechanism open to all nations.

 While the Near East, North Africa, East Asia and Latin America/Caribbean regions are expected to achieve average food supplies of 3,000 calories per day by 2010, 200 million people will still be malnourished in South Asia and 300 million, or one-third of the population of sub-Saharan Africa, will suffer from severe food deficits.
 Due to rapidly expanding population, agricultural production in sub-Saharan Africa would have to grow at four per cent annually in order significantly to improve per capita availability of food.
 Thus far, only East Asia has sustained such high growth rates in agriculture, averaging 6.1 per cent from 1970 to 1990.
 This trend, if not halted and reversed, casts a renewed spell of gloom over the hopes of hundreds of millions of people to escape from hunger, and over all our hopes for peace in the twenty-first century.
 The projection of future prospects based on past trends is especially questionable with regard to food.
 Not even some of the most prominent agricultural economists expected the gains in food production which have occurred in the past several decades.
 An international team of experts visiting India in 1963 projected a mere 10 per cent growth in foodgrain production by 1970, whereas growth actually achieved during this period was 50 per cent.
 Neither technological, nor financial nor natural resources pose insurmountable obstacles to achieving dramatically more over the next 15 years than is indicated by past trends or current projections.
 The idea that hunger cannot be conquered because we are running out of land to support rapidly burgeoning populations is contradicted by the facts.

Harruq shrugged and held out two branches he had whittled into crude imitations of swords.
 “Had to make something for me to spar you with,” he said.
 “Those sticks are unnecessary,” Aurelia said as she took up her staff, the tiniest hint of a smile curling on her lips.
 “Draw your swords.”
 “Are you sure?” Harruq asked, raising an eyebrow and gesturing to her completely unarmored figure.
 “I’ll only end up hurting you.”
 “You won’t,” she said.
 “Here.
 Strike me with your blade.”
 The half-orc’s jaw dropped a little.

Participation of the military in these activities necessitates a wider conception of both security and the role of the military in meeting security needs.
 Coping with the serious challenges from environmental and developmental security threats requires the mobilization of a wide range of scientific, technological and physical resources presently utilized for military purposes.
 There are significant precedents for the utilization of the military to support the environment and development – for construction of roads in Ethiopia and Yemen, bridges in Guatemala, as well as harbours, canals, railways and airfields; for afforestation projects and monitoring wildlife in India; for training of mechanics, electricians, and other productive skills; for urban renewal projects and drug enforcement in the United States, harvesting of crops in the USSR, flood rescue operations in Bangladesh, nuclear clean-up at Chernobyl, damage limitation after the vast oil spills and oil fires in Kuwait, humanitarian relief for Kurdish refugees, distribution of food and medicine in Bosnia and a host of other activities.
 In many developing countries the military can assist with efforts to improve social services in rural areas on a war footing – to spread literacy, primary education, basic vocational skills, health care and access to safe drinking water.
 The military have at their disposal scientific and technological resources which in many cases can be applied to environmental protection with the minimum of adaptation, such as information and monitoring systems that track changes in the atmosphere, in the oceans and on earth’s surface.
 These resources can be applied to environmental monitoring and impact assessment, protection of endangered species, quick response to disasters and accidents, energy conservation, and the minimization and management of waste.
 The appropriate role for the military in these various activities will depend on the country, the urgency of the circumstances, and the cost-effectiveness of military involvement compared with available alternatives.
 In some instances, it may be feasible to establish international ‘Earth corps units’, specially trained and equipped to carry out certain types of environmental protection and restoration, such as India’s eco-battalions, which seek to conserve the Himalayan habitat by restoring tree cover and constructing small dams and canals.

 The goals of peace, prosperity and fulfilment for every human being represent formidable challenges – intellectual, attitudinal, organizational and technological.

I looked back, intending to shoot the obnoxious pair a nasty glare in the hopes it would shut them up, and instead caught Alec's eye.
 The house lights were still bright enough for me to make out every detail of his perfect face, and yet I was still baffled by his expression.
 He'd obviously been staring at me, was still staring at me actually, but it wasn't a leer.
 It was something else, it made me want to blush, or maybe smile and toss my hair.
 Whatever it was, it left my skin feeling warmer than usual, and more than a little tight.
 Even after I looked away with a flush of embarrassment, I still felt like I could feel his eyes watching me.
 I could feel his presence behind and to the left of me, like a gentle tingle of electricity I could've pointed to even with my eyes closed.
 I resisted the urge to look back again as the lights dimmed and the orchestra began the opening strains of the first number.
 The actor playing Jean Valjean strode out onto the stage, and even weighed down by chains, he still commanded everyone's attention as though he was a member of the nobility.
 Each successive character somehow managed to latch onto my heart as they arrived.

Imeralda was huddled behind Doi’van’s great bulk.
 For a moment Rodregas thought she was hiding from fear of the great sorcerer.
 Then he saw she was actually reading one of the Grimoires that she must have had with her.
 Her fingers were making patterns in the air.
 She was too busy to look up at Rodregas, but he almost smiled.
 He had no idea what she was trying to do, but at least they had something to try.
 He needed to keep Van’dret busy to give Imeralda time to do whatever magic she was going to cast.
 Rodregas turned to Van’dret and said, “Well, since you are killing us today, how about we make things interesting for both sides?
 I will answer a question of yours every time that you answer one of mine.” Van’dret expression darkened and he almost hissed his outrage, “You would bargain with me, with your life held by a string?” For some strange reason that Rodregas was sure reflected a very deep character flaw, he felt his face break out in a very large toothy grin as he said, “And I have what to lose?” Van’dret stared at him for several long minutes before he shrugged and said, “Very well, ask me your question, but then you will answer mine or you die.” Rodregas simply nodded.
 He had no lack of questions, but was not sure which to ask first.

The feeling of absolute power then was greater than Qurrah had ever felt, greater than even the master of his youth._
 Why should I follow?
 _Qurrah heard himself ask.
 Hands stretched to the heavens, the cloaked man laughed.
 His power surged with the laughter, obliterating Qurrah’s ability to stand._
 Because I am eternal, _said the figure._ I sire war.
 I sow bloodshed.
 I create my dead, and the dead follow.
 What must I do?
 _Qurrah asked._

Rodregas nodded and said, “Decided that my advantage of strength was being matched by armor and steed, so it was time to use agility.
 I was not sure it would work.” “It will be harder the next time.
 Good luck,” Doi’van said.
 Rodregas’ next opponent for the joust was riding a powerful war steed and was in the dark non-reflective brown of full Night Bronze armor.
 Rodregas recognized the simple gray banner of Geriodon.
 His arm was decorated with the ribbons of his accomplishments in the tournament to date.
 As the flag fell it seemed like Geriodon was half way to Rodregas before Doom Hoof started to move.
 Rodregas knew that the only way he would be able to dodge the lance was if his timing was perfect.
 He raised himself up as the lance lowered down and dodged to the right.
 But the lance followed him this time and he felt his body being ripped off the saddle.

His movements were awkward in this new larger body.
 His angle was wrong, Rodregas felt like he was standing on a crate.
 “Should I order the birthday celebration milord?” asked the captain.
 The coming celebration had been the talk of speculation for months as well as the object of more than a little betting among the guards.
 Rodregas nodded, his thoughts swirling as he realized that he could use the celebration to his benefit.
 Without looking at the captain he walked toward the stairway, and the captain followed close behind him.
 At the door Rodregas took a deep breath and said, “Captain, that ceremony did not go smoothly, but the gods once again proved to favor me, and I wish to be generous with the birthday ceremony.
 Tell the purser to pay everyone an extra month’s wages today and give everyone a week off to spend as they wish.
 Make sure you tell Purser Stevents to be generous.
 I want all staff rewarded, even the kitchen drudges.” He finished, hoping it did not sound as halting and made up as he knew it to be.

That was really the thing that was the most unnerving.
 I'd only ever unconsciously drawn real places.
 To draw a pretend place was surprisingly unsettling, but I almost couldn't blame whatever part of me had gotten confused.
 The dreams were so clear and sharp they sometimes seemed more real than the rest of my life.
 By the time I finally realized what was keeping me from getting real sleep it was too late to worry about trying to get anymore rest.
 I just stared out my window at the light the previous owners had mounted on a pole.
 It was just close enough to see an amazingly thick cloud of insects swirl around it, captivated by the artificial glow.
 When I walked downstairs I found Mom's camping equipment piled in the living room.
 For all I'd tossed and turned, I must have gotten some sleep to have not heard her come in.
 I contemplated jotting down a note before just shrugging and skipping outside, happy for once to be shivering.

It has its benefits though."
 I snorted, and then felt myself turning red with embarrassment.
 You would think after seventeen years I'd have learned how to laugh without making those wretched sounds.
 "As if.
 I can't think of one good thing about everyone having their noses in everyone else's business."
 The smile was back, but it was more mischievous than before.
 "How about me knowing Britney left you high and dry after school today?"
 "Please.
 That just makes the humiliation more painful."
 Brandon shook his head as we pulled to a stop in front of my house.

 Miles away, Harruq awoke screaming.
 Aurelia rushed to his side as he curled into a ball, shuddering frantically.
 “He’s dead,” he said.
 Cold sweat covered his body.
 Remnants of his nightmare floated before his eyes, the icy voice of Velixar rolling over him in his vengeful fury.
 All he’d known, all he’d ever loved, was dead and gone.

I babysat his kids and watched his house while he vacationed, and did some odd jobs for him.
 My stepfather and his associates spoke openly about their various girlfriends and the dual lives they led.
 Dino also had a girlfriend and a separate apartment in which he put her up.
 My brother and I were young and we were afraid of this man so we didn’t disclose what we knew to anyone.
 When I was about fourteen years old, I missed curfew, which I knew was a big mistake.
 I tried to open the door with no sound.
 As I turned in the entryway to close the door as quietly as I had opened it, I felt a presence.
 I turned around and two hands were on my neck choking me and shoving me against the door.
 Dino, in the darkness, had a grip on my neck that he would not release.
 I grabbed his wrist and tried to push his hands off to no avail.

Based on the number of classrooms on the second floor, and the narrowness of the stairs, there was no point in trying to wait the crowd out.
 I gritted my teeth and limped out into the surge of bodies.
 Surprisingly enough, there were more familiar faces than expected.
 As I grabbed the handrail on the right, I noticed Isaac several feet ahead of me.
 Of course, it's hard to miss someone nearly six feet tall and almost as well-muscled as Alec.
 Even if he was partially hidden by Vincent, who was strutting along a little higher up the stairs with all of his usual arrogance.
 If Isaac had been the one close enough to reach out and touch, I probably would've tried to get his attention and said hi.
 With Vincent, I just stayed quiet and hoped he wouldn't notice me.
 I didn't want to risk tripping and making my ankle worse, so I was paying especially close attention to where my feet were going.
 If I hadn't been looking down, I would have completely missed it.

 "Oh, Rick."
 Her tears began coming faster.
 He tried to draw her closer, but she stiffened and then stood up.
 “Where-where are those books about time travel?” she asked, wiping her eyes.
 “In my office.” “I want to look at them again to see if I can find something that we missed.” “OK—I’ll help you.” “No.”  She shook her head, glancing at him but unable to meet his gaze.
 “I-I need to do it alone, OK?” “OK.” He watched her go, his heart heavy.
 He couldn’t stand to see her so unhappy, but he didn’t want her to leave.
 He loved her.
 He headed upstairs to make sure she’d found all the books and articles.

The blow blasted the air out of his lungs.
 The leader of the guards tugged all along Harruq’s face, pulling hair and scratching skin.
 “I’ll be,” he said.
 “It is real.
 No illusion and no disguise.
 You two cretins have god-damned elf blood in you.”
 “You jest,” Qurrah said, hanging back and showing no sign of aggression.
 The soldiers clearly thought Harruq the more dangerous of the two, and he was more than willing to let them continue thinking that.
 “No jest,” the guard said.
 “You two are leaving this city, now.”

CM:  	Why does rock and roll mean so much to so many people?
 BG:  	The beat, I think, first and foremost.
 The beat is the heart, the human heart, it gets right inside.
 I mean, you had it before, it was there in humans, back and back.
 Listen to “Sing Sing Sing” and see if it doesn’t get inside you.
 Then, what rock did, after Rickie and Buddy and those guys, rock got a conscience.
 Partly Dylan’s doing, but it was inevitable, it was headed that way, the power of it, the communicative power.
 Man, I sound like Rolling Stone.
 What I mean is that rock wouldn’t have held it’s place if it hadn’t shifted, if the words didn’t start to mean something.
 It was time.

She was the mom of three wonderful kids and the wife of a loving husband.
 In horror, she returned to intense and persistent prayer, telling God he couldn’t possibly mean she should leave her family, could he?
 Rather than reply with words, he used silence, like Tae Kwon Do Master Jeong used to do when one of us students offered an excuse for not training often enough.
 For weeks she waited, listened, and prayed God would at last reply that he had only been using the method through which he tested Abraham’s willingness to obey at any cost.
 Once she declared herself ready to forsake her family, he would release her from the need to do so.
 But he didn’t release her.
 She gathered together her husband and kids, all of whom she adored and treasured.
 The kids were age 9, 12, and 15.
 She told them she needed to leave.
 At first they didn’t believe her.

James Gang.
 Pacific Gas and Electric, Tony Joe White.
 Then, after Turntable Poison, we were headliners.
 It was great, a heady period, sure, especially for Skippy and Crafty, Castor and Pollux as I called them.
 They thought they’d landed in pigshit heaven, man.
 And we had all these other bands opening for us—man.
 And looking up to us.
 We were teenagers and we had these other guys, girls, coming up to us, asking about Dickinson and what I meant by “hoodoo on the bloody muddy” or some shit, something they heard on the album.
 It was weird.
 But, you know, I was kind of lost at that time—this was right before Lor came into my life—and I had all these groupies, all these chicks, and I’d ball them, right?, but really I’d be thinking about the music, about what’s next, musically, about soloing, about getting my axe to sound like a sax.

"Of all the places for you to intrude, why did it have to be here?"
 For a second, surrounded as I was by such beauty, I did feel like an intruder.
 He was gorgeous, and his tan skin seemed to have the slightest hint of light playing beneath its surface.
 I was as plain and ugly as always.
 My response popped out before I could think about it.
 "Only you could see such beauty and think only of keeping it to yourself.
 Trust me, even with surroundings like this I'd much rather be elsewhere if you're part of the bargain."
 The thought of being elsewhere brought our newest crisis to mind, and I realized that it was very likely I wouldn't have to worry about Britney, Alec, or Brandon for very much longer.
 "At least you won't have to suffer my presence for much longer; we'll be gone all too quickly."
 The fact I was saying these things to Alec when I knew this all had to be a dream was ludicrous, but it wasn't as ludicrous as the way he flinched at my words.

I’ve never seen so many in one place before.
 A Thrasher pack had at least six or seven but there must have been more than ten monsters total.
 It was scary.
 Right then, right at that very moment, I knew something was terribly wrong.
 They all stopped in front of us, all those pairs of angry eyes staring at us.
 They made me confused, from the warm feeling the Frost Beasts gave me to the cold feeling the Thrashers inflicted.
 They exchanged some sort of signal, including grunts and yips, and slowly advanced on us.
 The dogs stalked toward the four of us looking like a animals about to attack their prey.
 The cute look was gone and all that was left was hunger.
 The dog nearest to me jumped at my chest and landed on my stomach.

Vast libraries lined the walls, interspersed with decorated frames and ornate mirrors.
 A great vaulted ceiling rose overhead, embellished with intricate carvings, painted in every detail.
 Across the empty space before me was an elaborate table that seated six leaders of High Council.
 The guards who had brought me here were standing behind me, within arm’s reach on either side.
 Left of them were council members and, as I glanced right, Chevelle walked in to stand at attention, facing the council table.
 I could hear others enter behind us, presumably witnesses, and I wondered if Junnie was among them.
 “Elfreda Georgiana Suzetta Glaforia stands before High Council…” The formal tone of the speaker severed my rambling thoughts, dragging me back to a frightening reality.
 What would they do to me?
 How bad could the punishment be for sneaking into a library?
 And stealing a book.

He instantly realized the captain would know that all was not well.
 Rodregas felt exposed without his armor and said the first thing that came to mind.
 “Please, if you can get me my clothes.”  Rodregas waved over to where the sorcerers robe was folded on a small table next to the stairway.
 As he looked over, Rodregas saw that Junnit and Dale had re-bound the AElf maiden with iron and replaced her gag so that she could not use magic on them.
 While they guarded her they also kept her at a distance as if she was somehow strange now.
 To them she was supposed to have been consumed by the ritual, and they seemed a little put off to have the AElf maiden standing there.
 Both were watching their prisoner but also throwing quick concerned looks over to where Rodregas now crouched on the tower roof.
 Captain Poir looked hesitant but then nodded.
 He walked over to the table and gathered up the robes.
 “Damn, Rodregas thought” he had said “please.” Master Ravenhurr ordered something done; he did not say “please” to his guard captain.

Valjean launched into 'Who am I?
 ', and almost against my will I was pulled back around to where I could see the stage.
 Even as enthralled as I was by the music, I made a mental note to thank Alec after the performance.
 For once I wasn't going to try and get the best of him verbally, I was just going to walk up and thank him.
 The sense of being able to feel Alec behind me didn't diminish during the course of the play, if anything it gradually increased almost to the levels it'd been during the face-off with the college boys.
 Now though, it felt more reassuring than threatening.
 The rest of Les Misérables was even better than I'd hoped.
 Minutes and seconds went by faster than at any other time in my life.
 As the curtain finally came down, I brushed away the traces of tears that'd appeared on my face during the performance, and turned in my seat as the lights came up.
 Alec was gone.

Agriculture will remain the largest single occupation for the foreseeable future.
 For too long this sector has been regarded by planners primarily as the source of essential food production.
 Historically, agriculture has also played a major role as an engine for economic growth and employment.
 The Industrial Revolution in nineteenth-century England was spawned by rising productivity and incomes in agriculture that increased demand for manufactured goods.
 In post-war Japan, South Korea, and more recently Thailand, rising agricultural productivity and a shift to commercial crops have been dynamic engines for economic growth, job creation, higher incomes and rural purchasing power, wider markets for produce, and the growth of downstream industries.
 In Taiwan, this was the result of a conscious strategy to utilize agriculture to stimulate job creation and domestic demand.
 The vast technological gap between the levels of agricultural productivity achieved by most developing countries and the highest yields achieved globally represents an enormous untapped potential for stimulating economic growth and job creation.
 The reduction in agricultural subsidies to farmers in industrial nations called for in the recently signed GATT trade agreements will generate far higher international demand for agricultural exports from developing countries.
 In the next chapter, we argue strongly for an agriculture-led job creation strategy and cite evidence to show how it can generate sufficient jobs to eradicate poverty in many countries.

Skippy and Crafty were not even angry with Buddy, to hear them tell it today.
 Skippy works at Ardent and Crafty is a driver for UPS, but they recall those grand days with Buddy with something like ardor.
 “He was way ahead of all of us,” Skippy says.
 “His energy came from someplace else.” At any rate in early 1970, having witnessed the death of some of the gods, Buddy Gardner turned his back on Memphis, moved to L.A. with Lorelei, who then just as suddenly disappeared.
 Like a genii whose work is done.
 Some say she turned to making porno films.
 Some say she works in television.
 Some say she went back to perdition from whence she came.
 But it was in L.A. that Buddy transformed himself into a folk artist, a singer/songwriter with a heart on his sleeve and an ace up it.
 He was as mellow as yellow, as smooth as California sunshine.

Thirteen stones surrounded the corpse, each dabbed with a bit of Qurrah’s blood.
 Velixar held a piece of Ahrqur’s flesh in his right hand.
 “Are you ready?” Velixar asked his disciple.
 “Yes, master,” Qurrah said.
 The elder necromancer crushed the flesh in his grip, signaling the start of his casting.
 Dark, slithering words flowed from his lips, ominous in the starlight.
 As the minutes passed, the blood on the stones began to glow.
 Qurrah took up his own chant, a single phrase he was to repeat so that the spirit of Ahrqur could not flee once Velixar summoned it.
 “ _Drak thun, drak thaye, kaer vrek thal luen,_ ” he chanted.
 A part of him shivered, the words so similar to black words Master had spoken before the hyena-men had come.

We were outside the stone walls of the fortress finding sparse greens to eat, which bored me even in a dream.
 I encouraged the horse to run and he responded immediately, taking flight down the mountainside.
 The rocks streaked past us as we ran faster and faster, the wind whipping his mane.
 A great bird perched on the dead limb of an ironwood tree and I jumped to it just as it dropped from the branch and flared its wings out to catch the wind.
 We flew still farther as I watched the mountain pass below.
 There was a scrubby patch of trees ahead and I could see movement there, inside.
 I tried to focus on it… familiar silver and white.
 Commotion brought me back and I sat up, startled.
 My head spun.

 Inspired by the way he was toying with her hair, she asked, "Would you like to have a lock of my hair?"
 "That's a great idea."
 He bent to inhale its fragrance.
 She took scissors from a drawer and reached for a lock on the back of her head.
 She snipped one off and handed it to Rick.

 He fingered the silky lock.
 This was all he'd have left of her.

Still, he double-checked the keep and the courtyard very carefully before bringing out the cart and the horses and loading up all his booty.
 The cart groaned with the load.
 After a last check for Dire Cats in front of the keep he headed out and away from both Raven Keep and Raven Town and away from his old life.
 CHAPTER 4 A FRESH START OR AN OLD PROBLEM
 Raven Keep, unlike many fortifications, was not located on a high spot.
 In fact, it was perched half way down a gentle valley.
 Farther down the valley, only a few minutes’ ride away was Raven Town.
 Even the kindest of folk would admit the town was not much more than an inn, a stable, the homes of the people that supported the local farming community, and of course, Raven Keep.
 Many of the keep employees and their family members lived in Raven Town.
 Luckily for Rodregas, there was a turn off almost immediately that let him circle around the edge of town and then start heading out of the valley.

She received a nice allowance, but she knew she could always count on her father for a little extra.
 "Let's see."
 He took out his wallet and pulled out a ten.
 "How's this?"
 "Thank you, Father."
 She kissed the top of his head.
 "Who are you going shopping with?"
 "No one, but I'm meeting Mother for lunch.
 Good-bye."
 She headed for the door.

There are political, economic, social and technological forces active in the world today that can override the causality of past trends and combine together to make this a time of unprecedented opportunity.
 Intellectual synthesis: War is the result of a conflict that leads to a forceful resolution followed by a fresh period of progress.
 The end of the Second World War marked the defeat of fascism.
 It gave birth to the United Nations, followed by the dissolution of colonial empires and freedom for more than forty subject nations.
 The end of the Cold War marks the end of a seventy-year confrontation between two opposing ideologies – capitalist and socialist – that reflected a more profound conflict between two fundamental aspects of human existence – individual freedom and social responsibility.
 The posing of these two as opposite and mutually exclusive forces has for long limited our freedom of thought and action and prevented us from boldly experimenting with new ways to reconcile them.
 The peaceful termination of this confrontation has lowered the mental barriers.
 It provides us with an opportunity to synthesize these forces in a manner which balances individual freedom with collective action to eradicate the blatant manifestations of poverty, social injustice and inequity.
 Economic liberalism and rising investment in developing countries: One immediate result of this reconciliation has been the recent movement of economic liberalization spreading throughout the developing world, accompanied by the relaxation of bureaucratic constraints that impede growth.
 This trend has stimulated a dramatic increase in foreign investment in these countries, which has risen nearly six-fold during the past seven years.

The words of his brother echoed in his head.
 “Aurry?” he asked.
 “You said most elves remember when men were created…‌do you know how orcs were made?”
 The elf looked at him.
 She was trying to read him, Harruq could tell, but he endured it without protest.
 “When Ashhur and Karak warred, there were elves that sought to end it,” she said.
 “Against Celestia’s orders, they joined Karak, hoping their aid would finally end the conflict.
 When our goddess imprisoned the two gods, she cursed those elves.
 She stripped them of their beauty, their intelligence, and their long life.
 They weren’t evil, Harruq, but Karak offered them strength and they accepted it.

It seemed like she was having fun.
 I wondered if that meant she was causing trouble.
 “Don’t think he trusts you with the girl,” Ruby added, smiling playfully.
 “I prefer the outdoors anyway.” Steed dipped toward me, his hand folding his waist in a bow as he stood to go.
 “Sunshine.”
 My head was not up for this at all.
 His sister.
 Traveling with us.
 An asset.
 I leaned forward, resting my head on my knees.

Her tears began coming faster.
 He tried to draw her closer, but she stiffened and then stood up.
 “Where-where are those books about time travel?” she asked, wiping her eyes.
 “In my office.” “I want to look at them again to see if I can find something that we missed.” “OK—I’ll help you.” “No.”  She shook her head, glancing at him but unable to meet his gaze.
 “I-I need to do it alone, OK?” “OK.” He watched her go, his heart heavy.
 He couldn’t stand to see her so unhappy, but he didn’t want her to leave.
 He loved her.
 He headed upstairs to make sure she’d found all the books and articles.
 She was coming out of the office with a load of them.
 “I’m going to look at them in my room,” she told him.

The disruption of trade resulting even from regional conflicts such as the Gulf War or the war in Bosnia, impacts not only on the economies of the belligerents, but also on neighbours, trading partners and global economic performance.
 Neither the victor nor the victim can any longer afford to resolve conflicts violently.
 Political states may still be able to survive wars, but developmental achievements can not.
 So long as the benefits of development are confined to one or a few sections of society, the costs of militarization and war may not prevent economic and social progress.
 But when the need is to fulfil the rising expectations of the masses by extending the benefits of development to the entire society – thus enabling the society as a whole to move to the next higher level of collective affluence and fulfilment – every social resource must be garnered and harnessed for this purpose.
 The colossal cost of armaments and the catastrophic destruction of war are incompatible with the achievement of prosperity for all.
 Peace has become the fundamental imperative for development.
 War as an Instrument of Policy
 Humanity has lived with war for so many millennia that it is difficult to imagine a world without it.
 Even in the four decades of ‘peace’ following the Second World War, approximately 160 inter-state and intra-state wars, including 100 major conflicts, have been fought in developing countries, leading directly to 20 million deaths – half of them caused by the armed forces of developed countries in Korea, Indochina, Algeria and other anti-colonial wars – and to another 20 million war-related casualties.

I mean I was just trying to do something nice for you, but if you're going to be like that, we'll leave it here."
 Her grin didn't engender trust, but when I opened my mouth to call her on it, she forestalled me with an upraised hand.
 "I swear.
 We'll go home and leave the dress here."
 The pout came back out for a moment.
 "But, if you're not going to let me buy this for you, I'm going to need to compensate by buying something for Jasmin."
 Rachel flounced off, followed by a frowning Jasmin, leaving Dominic to help me out of the straitjacket I was currently using as a dress.
 Chapter 25 I slowly stretched, and then turned over and smiled when I found Alec lying on top of the covers.
 "Good morning, beautiful."
 As always, his voice sent shivers down my spine.

 “Where did you get the bruises?” Qurrah asked when Harruq returned to their squalid home.
 “Practicing,” Harruq said.
 “We have anything to eat?”
 His brother motioned to a small plate of bacon and some eggs still in their shells.
 “Wonderful.”

Her father had amazed her by showing her his love in a variety of ways.
 He and her brother had reconciled.
 She'd had several of the heart-to-heart talks with her mother that she'd longed for.
 She should be happier than she had ever been in her life.
 But she wasn't.
 She was more miserable than she had ever been in her life.
 All she could think about was Rick.
 As hard as it was to admit, she missed him more than she'd missed her family.
 When she'd walked into 2011, she'd been frightened out of her mind.
 It had been so fantastic, so strange and sudden.

I had apparently lost part of my memories and magic because I had been bound, was still bound.
 I realized Chevelle was watching me, waiting for the stone.
 Shaking free of the thoughts, I removed the pouch from my pack to untie the lacing.
 I reached inside, wondering momentarily what else might be written in the ancient language on the scroll.
 I handed the dark red stone to Chevelle, who only nodded as he took it from me, not examining it before he slipped it into a pocket to hide it away.
 There was a sound at the door and his fingers slid over my lower back, urging me into my room.
 I was closed in just as the main door opened, giving me no more than a glimpse of deep red curls.
 I tried not to be annoyed about being closed in a room.
 I was a prisoner after all.
 Chevelle’s voice was barely audible as he spoke to his visitor in a formal tone.

He only settled in.
 Both he and Ruby were staying with me.
 I was happy… downright blissful.
 Stupid dust.
 I watched Chevelle’s face as my eyes fluttered shut, exhausted.
 My dreams brought him close, a much-too-vivid kiss on the cheek that burned like fire.
 My skin was blistering, I could feel the color.
 It swirled around me and shocked me awake again.
 I lay on the floor, eyes wide, body unmoving.
 I was weak, tired, still under the influence, but I heard voices.

My friend Alan, with whom I’ve partnered for a lot of book signings, likes to hound me about a remark I once made, “There’s no such thing as a bad signing.” Well, by now I’ll admit that there is such a thing.
 But most often, even if you don’t sell many books, interesting stuff happens.
 And you never can tell when you’ll get blessed.
 Or challenged.
 Or both.
 A woman of kind and friendly demeanor comes into Chapters, a coffee shop bookstore in Newberg, Oregon, about a half hour from Portland.
 I’ll call this woman Curly.
 Though she's older than most college students, as her sweatshirt is lettered “George Fox,” I ask if she goes to nearby George Fox University.
 She gives me a rather wistful smile.
 “I used to.” Since I know some history of the Quakers, from having attended a year of Quaker meetings while in Chico, I ask if the college is Quaker.

How dare he use his kisses to try to keep her from going home!
 It was already hard enough just to look at him in the morning before she walked in the garden.
 He knew that whenever they kissed, she didn't want to stop, that she'd kiss him forever.
 Just last night he'd told her that they couldn't kiss like that unless they got married.
 And this morning he dared to kiss her that way, knowing that it would make her all but forget her walk!
 When she returned to the house nearly half an hour later, she stormed past him and up to her room.
 Rick knew for sure that she was mad this time, knew why, and knew he'd been wrong to do what he'd done.
 "Sweetheart, I'm sorry," he called running after her.
 "I shouldn't have done it.
 I just wanted you to know--"  He heard her door slam.

The other guard charged Qurrah and swung his longsword.
 The necromancer smirked, preparing another lashing.
 The flaming leather wrapped around the guard’s sword hand, charring flesh to bone as he screamed.
 The blade dropped as the guard held his blackened hand before him, bits of white bone catching the moonlight.
 “Mercy,” he begged, falling to his knees as the necromancer approached.
 “There is no such thing,” Qurrah said before magically hurling two pieces of bone through the man’s eyes.
 He turned to the other guard, who still gasped in vain for air.
 He watched until death claimed him.

One glance at her stifled reaction and I knew I’d not be able to ask her about what I’d read.
 “Sleep well?” she asked.
 “Oh,” I started, my voice hoarse.
 She handed me a glass of water, which she smoothly traded for the book.
 “Dreams,” I complained.
 She smiled as she sat on the bed beside me.
 “Some seek out the breath.
 They say it is foresight.” “Foresight?” She nodded.
 “What did you see?” She raised an eyebrow questioningly.
 “Not the future.” She laughed.

Typical cover up.
 “Hey Seth, it looks like Jazell didn’t kill you after all,” Emily said and flashed me a grin.
 “What was that all about anyway, Jazell?” I opened my mouth to spill the whole truth when Seth glanced at me.
 I sighed at his expression, knowing that I couldn’t tell anyone if Seth didn’t want me to.
 I didn’t want to make it worse by revealing what I knew.
 When I didn’t reply, she covered her mouth with her hand to try to cover her chuckles.
 “Oh then,” she giggled, “I hope you two had a nice chat.” “Stop it Emily!” I snapped and felt my face burn.
 She snickered.
 “Okay whatever you say, Jazell.” “We have to tell you guys something,” I told her and Jason about how the dwarf had showed up and what he said about Igneeria.
 Emily listened quietly but when I got to the part that we were supposed to go there, her mouth fell open.

But he trusted Davis with her.
 They sat close together holding hands as they listened to a mystery program.
 Marie wasn't paying attention.
 She was trying to think of a way to get Davis' arm around her.
 Or her head on his shoulder.
 Preferably both.
 Maybe .

 She yawned.

She then sat back on top of me while she continued to talk to me and I watched her in the mirror as she pulled her top off exposing her bare breasts.
 I kept watching her in the mirror and she was watching me.
 It got quiet and I needed an ice breaker for the silence so I quipped that she certainly didn’t dress like a cop and she laughed.
 She bent at the waist as she put her hands to the side of my shoulders and she pressed her bare breasts against my back.
 She rubbed her breasts on my back and buttocks as she maneuvered her body over mine.
 I couldn’t help but be aroused.
 She leaned in close to my ear with her mouth, her young body firmly against my back, and then asked me seductively if I would sell her the Oxy.
 I told her I would find out how many I had and we could probably work something out and sell them to her.
 She then asked me to turn over and she sat on me, barely above my crotch.
 I immediately noticed a tattooed first name of “Steve” on her flat stomach, just right of her belly button.

"I think I can."
 She raised the visor.
 "Can we go to the library now?"
 If this wasn't her home, she was going to find a way to get back.
 CHAPTER FOUR
 Marie sat beside Rick at the library, watching in amazement as titles of books and magazines appeared on a screen in front of him.
 Whenever he found something that he thought could help them, a machine in front of her would print the title and its number on a piece of paper.
 She'd thought it would take hours and hours to find a handful of books.
 But in only 45 minutes Rick had a long list of books and articles.
 He filled out request forms for the articles and led her into more rows of books than she'd ever seen.

This requires the identification of employment-intensive programmes that provide clear benefit to the community without interfering with existing business, such as the US Civilian Conservation Corps that built the US National Parks system in the 1930s.
 Expanding or upgrading the educational system would be a priority area.
 16.Make income distribution more equitable: The number of jobs available is directly related to patterns of income distribution.
 In Japan and other dynamic Asian economies, the ratio between the bottom and top pay is as much as 5 or 10 times lower than in the United States.
 A highly skewed income distribution results in lower levels of overall demand, growth and job creation.
 Lopsided income distribution fuels speculative investment, more and more of which goes overseas.
 The average wages for production workers in the United States are the lowest they have been since 1967, with 18 per cent of full-time workers not earning enough to keep a family of four out of poverty, up from 12 per cent in 1979.
 Income redistribution in the industrialized countries requires structural adjustments similar to those which the West has advocated for developing countries.
 A 'maximum wage' law can be introduced, requiring firms to pay taxes on exorbitant executive compensation.

Besides, she could just call it a performance piece, as someone who has seen the show already, that girl performs when she curses.
 It’s a sight to see, I just can’t tell whether it’s a natural wonder or a natural disaster.
 One thing is for certain, someone will have to put a rating for the content on the posters and ads.
 I’m thinking that nobody 17 and under should be allowed within a mile of the show.
 Karen – Content rating, it’s just a form of censorship.
 Art – I disagree, as a parent I find that it is a valuable tool to keep me informed of what will be in the shows and movies my kids watch.
 Karen – How strict are you with what they watch?
 Art – Not at all, they can watch what-ever they want to.
 Karen - Then what good do the ratings do you then?
 Art – They give me the heads up so I know what I don’t want to watch.

 We could hear him approaching the bedroom as the volume of his voice increased.
 We watched through the slats in the closet door as he would open her dresser drawers and rummage through her belongings, including her undergarments, while looking around over his shoulder, still yelling her name.
 Eventually, he would leave and somehow mom would come up with the rent to keep a roof over our heads for another month.
 We were getting old enough to know that we were different than most families in many ways, but we always knew we had a loving mother.
 Thomas and I also knew that the only other consistent thing in our life was each other.
 We were very close in size and we were often mistaken as twins although I had blond hair and he had brown.
