 None of them really had a disobedient bone in their body.
 They grudgingly returned to their seats and left Alec by himself.
 I picked my pencil back up and started drawing again, only to be disturbed by someone clearing their throat.
 Alec was looking down at me with something almost like a smile playing at the corner of his lips.
 For a second I couldn't blame the other girls for swarming him over.
 He was so attractive it was hard to remember he was such a jerk.

 One minute I was minding my own business trying to pretend like I didn't notice the nasty looks some of Brandon's friends were shooting my way when they thought I wasn't looking, the next I was going to the biggest dance of the year with the most popular guy in school.
 I'd half thought Cassie was going to rip out my throat.
 I walked past a pair of gorgeous, gold-fringed drapes, handed my ticket to a distinguished-looking man in a uniform, and then smiled as he pointed me towards my door.
 It was almost a relief to be around strangers again.
 He'd been polite, but hadn't tried to fawn over me.
 My being asked out had changed my treatment from almost every girl at school.
 Half the student body, the more sensible portion it seemed, had all decided that I was some kind of massively stuck-up slut.
 The other half had decided they needed to be my new best friend if they wanted to get invited to any of the cool parties ever again.

 I assured her that I just wanted a massage from a pretty young lady and I had no other motive.
 I repeated that I often got massaged from the same older woman and I thought it would be a treat to get a massage from a beautiful young one.
 As I lay there, I could see her in the mirror and we talked from this reflection.

Then he screamed to the sky, one long, primal roar of hopeless confusion.

In this and previous chapters, we have tried to present an integrated perspective of the political, economic and technological factors that need to be taken into account in formulating a comprehensive approach to the issues of peace, food and employment.
 In an effort to illustrate the potential efficacy of this approach in a country representing nearly 25 per cent of the world‚Äôs poor, ICPF conducted an in-depth country level study in India to evolve a strategy for stimulating massive increases in job growth and food production (see box pp.
 122‚Äì24).
 PROSPERITY 2000 STRATEGY FOR INDIA
 The potential for accelerating job creation and increasing food production through a mix of the strategies discussed in this report is illustrated by the strategy which ICPF has proposed to achieve full employment in India and thereby to raise the entire population above the poverty line by generating additional employment opportunities for 100 million persons in the coming decade.
 This strategy utilizes agriculture as an engine for growth by accelerating the development of commercial agriculture, agro-industry and agro-exports.
 It calls for a shift in thinking concerning agriculture from production for survival and subsistence to production for maximum and sustainable profit, from emphasis on meeting minimum needs to realizing maximum potentials, from commodity-based to resource-based planning.
 It seeks to tap the country's competitive advantage in labour-intensive agricultural crops and allied industries to double agricultural production - raising the annual growth rate to 4 per cent (versus 2.3 per cent in the 1980s) - achieve complete nutritional self-sufficiency, raise rural incomes and double India's total exports.
 Creating new jobs through this low-cost strategy can be accomplished entirely with the country's own resources, though foreign firms will find investment in India's agro-industrial sector very attractive.
 Initially, about half of the new jobs will be generated on farms by raising productivity through methods to improve management of micro-nutrients and water, expanding the total irrigated area by more complete utilization of the substantial additional capacity that has already been created, emphasis on more labour-intensive commercial crops such as sugar, cotton, fruit, flowers, and vegetables, sericulture, inland and coastal aquaculture, reclamation of wastelands for forestry and fodder, and increasing subsidiary incomes from animal husbandry and poultry.

 initiatives are to be92m implemented0m to92m accelerate0m growth of the agriculture sector of India92m,0m generating incomes of just over 28 million in 2020 in provinces equivalent to ours. An industry guide, an overview of a research92m process0m, and industry budget (PDF) are provided for each92m sector0m. As preliminary results become

The military have at their disposal scientific and technological resources which in many cases can be applied to environmental protection with the minimum of adaptation, such as information and monitoring systems that track changes in the atmosphere, in the oceans and on earth‚Äôs surface.
 These resources can be applied to environmental monitoring and impact assessment, protection of endangered species, quick response to disasters and accidents, energy conservation, and the minimization and management of waste.
 The appropriate role for the military in these various activities will depend on the country, the urgency of the circumstances, and the cost-effectiveness of military involvement compared with available alternatives.
 In some instances, it may be feasible to establish international ‚ÄòEarth corps units‚Äô, specially trained and equipped to carry out certain types of environmental protection and restoration, such as India‚Äôs eco-battalions, which seek to conserve the Himalayan habitat by restoring tree cover and constructing small dams and canals.

 The goals of peace, prosperity and fulfilment for every human being represent formidable challenges ‚Äì intellectual, attitudinal, organizational and technological.
 We cannot hope to reach such lofty achievements if we waste and squander the precious and abundant resources ‚Äì mental, psychological, social and material ‚Äì placed at our disposal.
 A massive reduction in emphasis on weapons production and military establishments, made possible by recent political events and demanded by the pressing unmet needs of people everywhere, represents both a great opportunity and a considerable challenge.
 The opportunity is not only further to reduce the threat of war by reducing the capacity for waging war, but also to redirect and utilize for other purposes the resources now dedicated to war making and prevention.
 The challenge is to do so at a time when rising unemployment and economic stagnation in many countries make further cuts in the size of the military unpopular domestically.

The answer to that question doesn‚Äôt really matter.‚Äù The dwarf held his hand out, ‚ÄúShall we go then?‚Äù I shrugged, ‚ÄúLead the way, shorty.‚Äù The dwarf gave me an annoyed look and walked towards the arch.
 I expected him to go right through but he disappeared in a swirl of black mist.
 Jason shrugged and ran in after him.
 ‚ÄúWait Jason,‚Äù Emily called.
 ‚ÄúDang, never mind.‚Äù She disappeared too.
 I went to follow her and hesitated.
 Seth walked up to me, ‚ÄúYou nervous?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy shouldn‚Äôt I be?‚Äù I said, shaking.

I go along with the belief that there is no such thing as ‚Äòmortal‚Äô magic.
 While we don‚Äôt have time now to go over all the proof, the general thought is that mortals are truly just animals and don‚Äôt produce magic.

 That's probably half of why she's so mad.
 I was so out of things yesterday I didn't think to let her know I was headed home with you."
 Rachel looked for a moment like she wanted to disagree, but she nodded, in the kind of noncommittal way people use when they don't really agree, but are ready to let you make your own mistakes.
 Rachel pulled her books together, and then followed me through the door, James two steps behind, and looking, amazingly enough, even more surly than he had a few seconds before.
 Rachel didn't seem to be one of those people who always had to be talking about something, but even so, two minutes of silence were enough to leave me scrambling for something to talk about.
 "Thanks for telling me about Les Mis√©rables.

 My eyes followed his as he looked down at our clasped hands and a cool blue flame lit on my right sleeve.

During my years between conversion and earnest churchgoing, I often experienced campus evangelists, church pastors, elders, and other enthusiasts whom I sensed wanted to make me into a notch on their belt, and who have left me doubtful about the worth of salesmen‚Äôs tactics in the service of God.
 During my college years, I would frequently get waylaid by too-friendly people.
 I must‚Äôve looked pagan or drug addled.
 Usually they ran in twos.
 While one of them smiled, the other would ask, ‚ÄúHave you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?‚Äù ‚ÄúYep,‚Äù I would say, and either stay and observe their perplexed surprise, or excuse myself before they could ask, ‚ÄúWhat church do you attend?‚Äù and then pitch theirs to me when I said I don‚Äôt, which was usually the case.
 The only effective evangelist I encountered in those days was Tony Tarantino, a lanky Jesus freak with frizzy red hair and an expression both bewildered and wise.
 I picked him up hitchhiking.
 He settled into the seat, set his Bible on his lap, stared at me for a minute and asked, ‚ÄúHave you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?‚Äù ‚ÄúYep,‚Äù I said, and readied myself to field the standard subsequent questions.
 Tony said, ‚ÄúOh.

 As a consequence, I could see Alec's entire group, and I was amazed by their reaction to Cassie's belligerence.
 Jasmin's pretty lips drew back in something that looked almost like a snarl, and she'd tensed up so tightly she was almost shaking.
 For a heartbeat I thought Jasmin would launch herself at the other girl, but Alec reached over without looking, and grabbed her arm.
 A stocky, Middle Eastern-looking boy to Alec's right looked like he wanted to act as well, but he was looking at Alec, and an almost imperceptible headshake stopped him.
 I'd been so busy watching the byplay behind Rachel that I'd missed the last two exchanges between her and Cassie.

 We hid under a pool table and talked about Eric and our dubious futures.
 Karen didn't care to join us for yet another party at Black's Beach, a place only accessible by a trail down a high sea cliff, where police never showed to bust rowdy kids for drinking.

If trade is to develop between private enter prises, credit checking agencies and collection agencies need to be established.
 For enterprises which do not qualify or cannot compete for limited bank resources, financial institutions offering hire purchase or leasing of industrial and consumer goods are necessary.
 The market reforms were expected to lead to a rapid proliferation of new small enterprises, but most of those created so far are engaged only in trading and retail sales.
 Small business development centres, business incubators, industrial estates, and venture capital funds are needed to encourage entrepreneur ship.
 Some large industrial enterprises have begun leasing portions of their space and equipment to groups of employees who form small businesses for production of equipment and components.
 This practice should be encouraged and popularized as a natural step towards privatization.

 But I do have one other Black Yew bow and a bigger sword that probably makes more sense for you to use than me, since I have used nothing but short swords for a very long time.‚Äù Rodregas then pulled out the two-handed great sword that he had found at the keep and handed it to Doi‚Äôvan.
 On Doi‚Äôvan it was more a hand and a half sword, but as he flourished it around a bit, Rodregas could see he was pleased.
 ‚ÄúThe steel is simple, but the balance is good.
 I am starting to be very happy that I helped pull this wagon up the hill,‚Äù he said with a deep chuckle, which sounded like distant thunder.
 Rodregas nodded and said, ‚ÄúI am afraid other than a few items to sell everything else is food and blankets for us... and the horses and tools that I stripped out of the Raven Keep.
 I figured I would need the tools to fix this place up and make it livable.‚Äù Rodregas continued, ‚ÄúIt is dark and late.
 Let‚Äôs make camp in here.
 In the morning we can start seeing about getting this farm in order.‚Äù With that they all worked together to get the barn organized and clean.

As the three were led away, Rodregas asked the boy the name of the sorcerer at the table.
 ‚ÄúThat is the Immortalist Van‚Äôdret, Ambassador to the Knights from the Guild.
 He is very powerful you know.
 We are told to do whatever he commands, but also told to stay as far away from him as possible,‚Äù said the young boy, who could not have been much more than twelve years old.
 Rodregas nodded and said, ‚ÄúSounds like good advice.‚Äù Rodregas looked up as Doi‚Äôvan and Imeralda entered the room.
 Doi‚Äôvan looked grim.
 But as Rodregas assumed no one had died, he had to smile.
 ‚ÄúIs it that bad?‚Äù he asked.
 Doi‚Äôvan missed his amused tone, or he was simply not in the mood to hear it.
 ‚ÄúThe news is not all good,‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan agreed.

 But I was never good at that anyway.

The Challenge and the Opportunity
 The problem of unemployment is of relatively recent origin.
 The very idea of employment as opposed to livelihood is a recent conception born of the Industrial Revolution.
 In principle, every human being born creates at least the potential for his own employment, because his very birth generates demand for additional products and services and because each individual possesses the innate capacity to acquire productive skills and creative knowledge capable of generating new products and services to meet new and existing social needs.
 That is why, in spite of rapid strides in the mechanization of agriculture and mass production in manufacturing, the six-fold multiplication of human population since 1800 has been accompanied by a more or less equivalent growth of employment opportunities.
 The present job gap is small compared with the enormous expansion of the labour force.
 As people develop, their aspirations rise and higher level needs emerge ‚Äì needs for education, health care, balanced diet, entertainment, travel and communication ‚Äì multiplying demand for new workers to provide them.
 Of course, there can be and are temporary dislocations and disorientations, sometimes severe, resulting from the rapid speed of social transformation that makes existing attitudes and skills obsolescent within a lifetime or less and compels human beings to learn to adapt faster and further than ever before in human history.
 This is the challenge posed by the evolution of humanity from the physical to mental stage, the flip side of the process that has given birth to all the miraculous achievements of the past few hundred years.
 It is a challenge posed to all humanity to expand our minds and acquire more flexible attitudes, to learn and adapt faster, to convert the stress of change into the joy of higher accomplishment.

s posed to all humanity require more than the divinely-given capacity to evolve and92m develop0m new character traits 92m‚Äì0m strength and resilience require an exciting transformation of the personality ‚Äì making their92m personalities0m, their reason for their ability to adapt92m,0m and the degree of strength92m and0m courage they possess, more and more important.

A tiny figure, a being of light temporarily clothed in flesh, one who seemed almost at the point of breaking out of her mortal husk.
 She was so breathtakingly beautiful it was several seconds before I noticed the other, nearly unformed details of the room.
 They were so indistinct it took me a full minute to place them.
 Once I did, my eyes darted back to the sleeping figure, the gorgeous one whose features I now recognized as Cindi's.
 Only it couldn't be Cindi because the room was mine, the one here in Sanctuary.
 My pulse racing, I refused to look at the signature again.
 I now knew what it was, but if I ignored it maybe I could ignore the ramifications of everything I'd just learned.
 The room was swimming as my battered psyche finally took one blow too many, but I fought the attack with everything I had left.
 I couldn't afford to be found here collapsed on the floor.

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù I finally choked out, but they were tight-lipped.
 ‚ÄúHow do you feel?‚Äù Chevelle asked.
 His tone was off, a little shaky.
 I couldn‚Äôt tell if he was cross or something else.
 There was something so familiar about him, the way he leaned over me, but my thoughts weren‚Äôt working right yet.
 I tried to clear my head before answering.

It came out a little rude.
 I would have tried to smooth things over but I was too busy trying to brace myself against the panic attack I was sure was coming.
 My vision swam for a moment, but all the practice compartmentalizing my mind seemed to be paying off.
 I looked up.
 Britney looked a little crestfallen.
 She was probably deciding to ask for a different seat assignment after class.
 "Sorry about that.
 I don't really like it when people shorten my name.
 Bad associations with nicknames and all that."
 Britney's smile was only a pale imitation of the brilliant thing she'd flashed a few moments previously, but it signaled a willingness to try and make small talk at least.

For one, I had lived on my own since I was fifteen.
 I didn‚Äôt have any choice after the abuse I had endured.
 As far back as I could remember everything seemed to go wrong for me and I was fighting an uphill battle.
 I put myself through my last years of high school, had no college education, almost everyone I knew abused drugs; I had essentially raised myself from puberty and I obviously didn‚Äôt know what I was doing.
 I had made far more mistakes than my ego would allow me to acknowledge.
 I guess this was my bottom.
 Moving back to Sacramento would be the first time in many years I would live with my mom, who had recently become a widow.
 She needed my help sorting things out, because she was left with a lot of complex issues after Dino‚Äôs suspicious death.
 The story goes that Dino was at an associate‚Äôs home helping him cut some hedges.
 He cut into a bush that apparently had a yellow jacket nest in it and they swarmed him and stung him to death.

How could I have seen him?
 Chevelle mumbled something and my ears began to ring, distracting me from bewilderment.
 It was only a few stuttered heartbeats before recognition came.
 ‚ÄúStop!‚Äù I hissed.
 All eyes turned to me, but I glared at Chevelle.
 ‚ÄúStop,‚Äù I repeated.
 He understood.
 My ears ceased ringing, my hearing cleared.
 I stepped forward, the rage still fuming.
 I felt like a fool for not realizing before.

But the horse felt incredibly sluggish compared to his own mount.
 Hopefully, the horses positive qualities would shine in the tournament.
 As Rodregas circled around the courtyard warming up his horse he noticed fewer horses than he expected.
 After Doom Hoof seemed awake he headed over to where Doi‚Äôvan stood.
 For this competition each squire was allowed a servant to provide support, mostly assistance with equipment, especially fresh lances.
 ‚ÄúWhere is everyone?‚Äù he asked Doi‚Äôvan.
 Doi‚Äôvan did not look up from the ground where he was trying to straighten out a shield without doing more damage and said, ‚ÄúI wondered that myself.
 Apparently most drop out by this point.
 A lot have been injured, especially during yesterday‚Äôs sword and shield competition, and many simply quit due to not having any points yet.
 If you are going into the most dangerous part of the competition to be injured or killed and you have only one or two points, why bother?‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan said.

The rain streaked through my hair, soaking it to my head.
 Seth looked extremely annoyed as he stood there, his blue hair plastered to his face.
 His eyes were half covered by his hair and his eyes locked onto mine.
 He rolled his eyes and looked away.
 Jason had his arms over his head, trying to keep the rain off his red hair but I already saw dark spots all over it where the rain had escaped his arms.
 Emily's pink hair was dry and safely under a hood.
 Wait, what?
 ‚ÄúEmily, how come you have a hood?‚Äù I had to shout over the rain.

He placed the side of his face against mine and whispered into my ear.
 "I'm not going to let anything happen to you.
 If there's a way to keep you safe I'll find it."
 The feel of his breath caressing my cheek sent tingles racing through my entire body, but even that couldn't completely reassure me.
 Still, I gave it my best effort, and if my smile wasn't entirely convincing, it was at least good enough to temporarily reassure Alec.
 I followed him into class, pausing while he handed his note to Mrs. Sorenson.
 It was almost worth all of the craziness and exhaustion of the last seventy-two hours to see her eyebrows rise in astonishment as she read the innocuous piece of paper essentially giving Alec carte blanche in her classroom.
 "This is highly irregular, Mr. Graves.
 In fact I don't believe the administration can legitimately expect me to comply."

Rodregas opened it to find only a few silvers.
 He knew Korin should have more.
 He opened his shirt and, as he suspected, another purse hung from his neck.
 It was of flat leather and inside it were twelve pieces of silver and a small book.
 Rodregas tentatively touched the book and it buzzed slightly of magic.
 It held no foulness so he tossed it into the trunk.
 He added the coin purses to the robe he was wearing.
 He still needed more hard money and some decent clothes.

One day Tom‚Äôs father called me to thank me for Brandon‚Äôs friendship to his son.
 He was emotional when he called as he told me that long after the fundraisers, gatherings and phone calls for his son had stopped, only one friend was still calling and visiting and it was Brandon.
 I was so very proud of him.
 One evening, less than a year later, Brandon cancelled a night out with his friends, including Tom.
 He didn't feel like going out.
 His wheelchair-bound friend went anyway.
 The phone rang late that night with the unbelievable news of another car accident.
 This time Tom‚Äôs paralyzed body was thrown through the window and he tumbled down the highway to his death.
 Brandon was inconsolable.
 His best friend was dead.

Maybe there really wasn't any kind of link between him and the dreams.
 Maybe I'd have one of them tonight without him making any kind of appearance.
 I sincerely hoped not, but I'd rather not have them right now than see the disdain he'd displayed earlier in the day.
 ** The next morning played out essentially the same as the day before.
 I awoke to an empty house, and then hurried to get ready and down to the bus stop so I wouldn't be stranded if nobody else showed up to give me a ride into school.
 Brandon smiled as he pulled up and found me patiently waiting for the school bus.
 "One of these days you're going to go ahead and wait for me at your house, and then I'll know you finally trust me."
 I didn't feel much like playful banter, but I marshaled a semi-convincing smile and gave it my best go.
 "Oh, I trust you, I just know that you've got more important things to worry about.
 One of these times you'll either forget to come get me, or you'll forget to tell me you're not coming by anymore."

Within the next decade, the aging of the population is expected to reduce job pressures and even lead to labour shortages in some European countries.
 Job growth has been quite rapid in the developing countries over the last forty years, more than doubling total employment.
 The single most important factor behind rising numbers of unemployed persons and increasing absolute numbers of families below the poverty line in developing countries has been the 2.4-fold expansion of population in the Third World, and more than doubling of the economically active population since 1950, which have resulted in a 4 per cent decline in the overall employment rate.
 Population growth rates continue to fall steadily in most countries, with the exception of Africa, providing an opportu nity for economic growth and job growth to catch up with the population explosion of recent decades.
 Along with rapid quantitative job growth, the global economy has achieved dramatic qualitative gains in the nature of employment.
 During recent decades, there has also been a marked movement away from subsistence level manual occupations, primarily in agriculture, to more skilled and remunerative forms of employment.
 Worldwide, the percentage of the work force engaged in agriculture has fallen by 24 per cent since 1950, from 67 to 51 per cent.
 Unemployment is of growing concern today primarily because population has expanded in recent decades even faster than job creation and because a larger percentage of the population, principally women, seek employment now than at any time in the past.
 The shortages of jobs and the resulting poverty represent the most pressing social problem in the world today.
 But viewed in historical perspective, it is clear that substantial progress has been made during the post-war period, making humanity as a whole more prosperous than at any previous period in recorded history.

I flipped open my notebook and tried to distract myself with a brief sketch, only to tear the page out and ball it up as the bell rang.
 I looked up to see Alec staring at me, which just made me mad.
 It was completely unfair.
 I wasn't going to get to go to Les Mis√©rables, but he was rich enough to fly to New York and book the whole theater.
 As Mrs. Alexander stood up to take roll, a burst of static silenced us all.
 "It's my pleasure to read off the names of the five winners in our drawing for tickets to Les Mis√©rables."
 "The first winner is Pam White."
 Somewhere down the hall I heard someone yell, and then an entire class broke out into cheers.
 I knew I should be happy for Pam, but I was too busy wishing everyone would quiet down so we could hear the next name.
 Mrs. Alexander shut the door, muting the roar as Principal Gossil continued with a slight rustle of papers.

Unbeknown to the Moon, the Earth had anticipated his great gesture of love, and sent forth a plague upon the land.
 As Adjam, the elder of the brothers, descended from the heavens and touched down upon the Earth, he collapsed to the ground in pain.
 Despite his agony as the very bones of his body rearranged themselves, he managed to call out a warning to Inock, to flee back to the Moon.
 The love of Inock for Adjam was so great that he rushed to his brother's side, where he too fell victim to the Earth's plague."
 I wanted so very badly to remain awake, but wrapped comfortably in the warmth of Alec's arms, I couldn't fight off exhaustion any longer, and I felt myself drift off into dreams of two brothers who survived the plague, rising from the ground after seven days, one a wolf, the other a jaguar.
 Chapter 24 I'd been awake for several minutes before I finally remembered where I was.
 I rolled over, opened my eyes, groaning when I saw that the other side of the bed was empty.
 Who knew what Alec thought.
 He'd obviously fled his own room to avoid talking to me when I finally woke up.
 Donovan's gentle knock and appearance at the door pulled me up short before I could really get going on the self-loathing.

I still believed that, but my desire to be with Alec had devoured the parts of my brain that used logic and reason to decide things.
 I wanted to be with him while he slept, even if it was only for a couple of hours.
 Everyone in the pack already knew I'd spent the night.
 In the end, the reasonable part of me never had a chance.
 Waking up next to Alec fully vindicated my decision.
 He'd greeted me with his typical, heart-stopping smile and I'd leaned in to kiss him before I'd even realized I was in motion.
 He'd pulled back, but his expression at least wasn't reproachful.
 I wanted to force the issue, wanted it so badly I could feel the desire bubbling inside me, but even more than my natural shyness, the thought of him pulling away again, this time in disgust, was too much to contemplate.
 Once we got to school, I'd found the rampant gossip had subsided to a dull rumble, but the few undecided votes had come down solidly on the side of everyone else.

The coaches believed Eric had quit out of wounded pride.
 The truth was, disappointing people wracked him with shame.
 We wanted to rejoin the teams that year.
 But until our sport came into season and we officially made the teams, we got denied privileges afforded to athletes, like assigned gym lockers.
 Since Eric still wanted to work out and wouldn‚Äôt face the world without a shower afterward, Cliff invited him to share his locker.
 Besides running the mile during track season, Cliff was second man on the cross-country team, behind Gary Hafner.
 Eric used the locker for a couple weeks before Coach Gory summoned Cliff to his office, sat him down, and asked him to explain why a new sweat suit just issued to Gary Hafner had turned up missing and gotten found in Cliff‚Äôs locker.
 Cliff maintained that he‚Äôd never even seen the sweat suit.

Democracies can only thrive and the revolution of rising expectations can only fulfil itself peacefully, when economic opportunities are provided to every human being.
 The recent rise of the political right, ethnic unrest and opposition to immigration in Western Europe, and the surge of crime in the United States, are sufficient evidence of the corrosive impact that unemployment can have, even on mature democracies.
 Increasingly, those excluded from the benefits of modern society reject its standards of justice and ignore its laws.
 The end of the ideological confrontation between capitalism and communism leaves the market system exposed at its weakest point ‚Äì its impersonality and insensitivity to human needs and suffering ‚Äì with no longer any lesser alternative to point at in self-justification.
 Having rejected the inadequacies and abuses of authoritarian socialism as a solution, we are compelled to find other methods to achieve social equity.
 In the present context, employment is the most effective way to distribute the fruits of development among people.
 The world is now capable of producing sufficient food and other basic necessities to feed, clothe and house everyone; but without opportunities for employment, people lack the purchasing power needed to buy them.
 Economic entitlement, rather than a shortage of food or food production capacity, is the key to global food security.
 Lack of employment opportunities is also directly linked to destruction of the environment, both rural and urban.
 The destruction of tropical rain forests has been one result.

‚ÄúRodregas, what in the name of the Celestial Winds are you doing?‚Äù He paused in his climb, his toes caught in the bark.
 Rodregas could feel the wetness of blood on his toes and he felt like he was going to slip at any moment.
 He breathed deep and yelled, ‚ÄúI am climbing the damn ‚ÄòOne Tree,‚Äô what does it look like?
 Now, shut up before I fall.‚Äù  He continued his climb, finally reaching a branch.
 The branch was on such a scale that he had to climb the branch coming up its side.
 The bark of the branch was smoother and offered less of a grip.
 Finally he got to the top, which was broad and actually rather cup-like against the main trunk.
 Though he worried about Imeralda, he let himself rest for a moment to recover.
 After a few minutes Rodregas got up and looked around for Imeralda.
 He saw that she was actually far out on another impossibly think branch.

 I felt like I'd been hit in the stomach.
 I hadn't realized just how fond of me Mrs. Campbell was.
 My mind whirling with too many thoughts to sort out, I turned to go back to my desk, only to find Alec staring at me.
 He still didn't seem happy to be sharing the same room with me, but the complete disgust from half an hour before had been replaced with something more measuring.

The true change came in the evening, the nights were full of such pleasure and joy such as Rodregas had seldom known in his life.
 The rest of summer passed as the most joyful that he had known, as the three started to the Kata and the staff.
 After the staff they moved to the bow where Imeralda became the master.
 To use the magical Black Yew bows required learning a spell to merging with the bow.
 The spell was unlike anything Rodregas had learned.
 Imeralda said it was seldom taught to non-nymphs, though Ravenhurr had known the spell and taught a few of the guards with a touch of the talent.
 Using the bows was a matter of sending your innate power into the wood and singing with it.
 Not singing out loud, but making the power vibrate and move in a rhythm that matched the wood.
 When that magical rhythm was reached, the bow suddenly became almost fluid and moved nearly of its own volition.
 The arrows flew with incredible force and accuracy.

Disappointment filled my face as I looked back at him.
 He tilted his head toward the stone; I would have to make this sculpture myself.
 I closed my fist around it, mostly because I had seen him do the same, and instantly I knew what I wanted to see.
 I opened my palm up, grinning triumphantly, and exposed my creation for Chevelle to see.
 Balancing there was a slightly misshapen but undeniable sculpture of a small black horse.
 Chevelle rolled his eyes.
 Still smiling, I looked back to the stone, but it had returned to its uninteresting round shape.
 Chevelle answered my unspoken question.
 ‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ tricky.‚Äù He smiled a little at using Steed‚Äôs word.

3.Economic strategy must be balanced: A market economy can be introduced gradually or step-wise, but it cannot be introduced in a fragmentary or piecemeal manner.
 Deregulation of prices was the most prominent feature of the strategy in most countries, because it was the easiest to implement.
 But under conditions of shortages in economies dominated by huge monopolistic enterprises, price deregulation led to skyrocketing prices and spiralling inflation.
 A market flourishes only when several essential conditions are met ‚Äì freedom of pricing, freedom of entry and exit from industry, free flow of information, unrestricted movement of goods and services, competition between enterprises, control of monopolies, and private ownership of property.
 The entire package of free market practices must be implemented hand in hand, otherwise it does not work.
 Freeing pricing without first regulating or dismantling monopolies, promoting privatization of land and enterprises, ensuring free flow of goods, and establishing wholesale markets and multiple distribution out lets lead to speculation, soaring prices, hoarding and falling production.
 Historically, the free market evolved over centuries in conditions of surplus production and stable currency, neither of which exist in Eastern Europe today.
 Efforts to accelerate the development of the market will have first of all to meet the political, legal, social and economic conditions historically required for its creation.
 And these conditions must be met simultaneously.

The achievement of food security and full employment depends on the establishment of new types of public and private organizations ‚Äì commercial, financial, industrial, export, research, educational and training.
 These institutions are needed to encourage, support, standardize, regulate and control development activities.
 New institutions lie behind the success of most major development achievements.
 India‚Äôs Green Revolution was as much a product of new quasi-governmental organizations created for supplying inputs, warehousing and marketing as it was of new farm technology.
 India‚Äôs dairy revolution was propelled by the rapid proliferation of producer cooperatives.
 Thirty years ago government was the only agency capable of setting up and managing activities on so massive a scale.
 Today the society is more developed and many of these functions can be handled more efficiently in the private sector.
 In either case, organization must play a central role.
 Wherever countries fail to live up to their natural potential, some institutional gap will be found that prevents new activities from taking off.

Informal private service enterprises in construction, commerce, food catering, repair and transport have vast growth potential.
 Rapid expansion of education, training and public health, especially rural health and education, can also serve as a conscious strategy for employment generation.
 Technology of organization
 Much emphasis is placed on the widening gap in technology between North and South, but the gap in the technology of organization is even greater.
 Creation of new types of systems and organizations can create markets and jobs in many ways.
 The Dutch system of flower auction co-operatives is so successful that 68 per cent of the entire world‚Äôs exports of cut flowers pass through markets in the Netherlands.
 The franchise system has led to a rapid proliferation of new businesses and new jobs in the West in such widely diverse fields as food services, home remodelling, dry cleaning and real estate.
 Industrial estates, export processing zones, export promotion councils, export insurance, warehouse receipts, quality standards, and thousands of other organizational innovations have been either created or borrowed by developing countries to accelerate social progress.
 A comprehensive study of successful systems and institutions that can be transferred and adapted to local conditions will document the enormous untapped potential for stimulating faster economic and job growth by inventing, imitating and further improving social systems.

In India the textile industry provides employment to 18 per cent of the entire workforce, accounts for 8 per cent of the country's GDP, 17 per cent of its manufacturing capacity, and 27 per cent of its export earnings.
 A recent projection indicates that with the lifting of quotas under the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing in January 2005, India‚Äôs textile exports could rise from the current $16 billion to $40 billion by 2010, creating as many as 12 million new jobs in the process, five million jobs through direct employment in the textile industry and another seven million jobs in allied sectors.
 The global manufacturing strategies of multinational corporations will further spur the exponential growth of contract manufacturing opportunities in developing countries.
 Already China exports $300 billion a year in manufactured products, while Taiwan and Mexico export more than $140 billion each.
 According to a recent study, India has the potential to create 25 to 30 million new jobs in the manufactured exports sector.
 Shift to Services: One would hardly expect to find the decline of manufacturing jobs as a source of employment opportunities, but historical data supports this conclusion.
 Fear over the destruction of manufacturing jobs due to adoption of capital intensive technology has been prevalent for the past 100 years.
 Every new technology that automates a process or increases worker productivity has been perceived as a threat to the future of work.
 The reality has proved to be quite different.

 When Qurrah looked up, he saw hundreds of the threads twisting and curling together, coiling toward a hidden presence deep within the orc army.
 Taking in a deep breath, Qurrah pooled his strength and focused on the skull taunting his brother, visualizing the thread and seeking to sever it.
 There was a pull on his chest‚Äîthe taste of copper on his tongue.
 When he opened his eyes, the skull fell to the battlements.

I rose above, peering down at myself, and the image turned into my mother, the dark water going black, the ripples transforming to wind.
 I recognized the scene as her pendant began to glow, the wind howling, screams piercing my ears.
 It was the same dream, but different now.
 I glanced around to find a village I didn‚Äôt know.
 Someone was coming toward me, an expression of fear and sadness on his handsome face.
 His familiar face.
 He reached out to me and I stepped toward him, tears streaming down my cheeks.
 He wrapped his arms around me as I turned again to see my mother.
 A howl of rage escaped her and I started to go to her, but he held me.

 Britney was oddly quiet as we entered the lunch room.
 I was a little hungry, but the pangs were a distant kind of discomfort.
 The real suffering for not eating wouldn't come into play until we hit the tutoring lab.
 Oh well, when I got home ravenous and ate a decent-sized meal Mom would probably be ecstatic.
 Or too wrapped up in some project to even notice.
 It was hard enough anticipating what I was going to do from day to day.

 Too soon, I would learn about other reasons.
 Girls adored him.
 They phoned at all hours, even risking Sylvia‚Äôs wrath, and they tailed him through the halls of our school.
 But if he had even kissed one of them, he kept it secret.
 A favorite of his, along with Margaret and Pam, was Carol, who had been his companion at Carmen Ranch club until their mystery afternoon together.
 Whatever happened might've tainted but didn't entirely spoil the pleasure they took in each other‚Äôs company.

He quietly unlocked it and stepped back and said simply, ‚ÄúEnter,‚Äù and waited for the Adapt to come inside.
 Korin came into the room with a relaxed step that showed him to be much more comfortable than Rodregas was.
 Korin was a good looking man.
 It was always weird with him.
 He changed bodies so often that you always felt like you were meeting someone new, but it was not long before you realized that it was Korin.
 He wore a slim male body that was well-built, not much over 20 years old, with blue eyes and blond hair.
 Rodregas was not sure what to say to him so he stood there simply looking.
 He was the Master and it would not be surprising for Ravenhurr to keep him waiting for a few minutes.
 Korin waited patiently, seemingly at ease with what Rodregas would assume to be strange behavior by Master Ravenhurr.

 I think I managed to keep the disappointment off of my face.

Information Technology and IT-enabled services stand out as the most important new fields of employment to emerge since the popularization of the automobile.
 While the Commission‚Äôs report anticipated the importance of the information superhighway even before the World Wide Web radically transformed global communications, information exchange and commerce, ICPF did not foresee the dramatic impact that the Internet would have on the future export of service jobs to developing countries.
 The West has been exporting manufacturing jobs in large numbers for half a century, fuelling the growth of Japan, the East Asia tigers, and more recently China; but until the emergence of the information superhighway, the scope for export of service jobs was limited.
 Technological development has changed that.
 As a result, business process outsourcing has become one of the fastest growing sectors of the world economy.
 As growth of the labour force slows in high-income countries, there will be increasing pressure for export of service jobs.
 Public concern in the West over the rapid growth of outsourcing is fuelled by the common misconception that employment is a zero sum game.
 A recent authoritative study of the impact of IT outsourcing found that the direct gains to the US economy in the form of additional jobs in other fields, higher real wages, higher real GDP growth, contained inflation and expanded exports far outweigh the losses.
 While global IT software and service outsourcing displaces some IT workers, total employment increases as the benefits ripple through the economy.
 The net additional number of jobs in the USA added as a result of outsourcing is projected to exceed 300,000 by 2008.

We were an oddity in the sixties to almost everyone we met.
 Other parents would question us when we visited our friend‚Äôs homes, extracting information that we were ignorant enough to share and which likely hit the gossip circuit immediately.
 The other mothers were threatened by our mother, as she was beautiful and divorced!
 I would later realize how poorly my mother was treated by other mothers, and how she endured many unwanted sexual advances and groping by their spouses and her employers.
 It was the sixties, and my mother was damaged goods in their eyes; she was vulnerable.
 We eventually moved out of my grandparents‚Äô home to an apartment in Los Angeles and then to a small rental house in Burbank that backed up to a military plant.
 Barrels of who-knows-what lined the side of our back fence.
 I guess the rent is cheaper when you live next to a toxic dump!
 We had a yard for our dogs and new friends to meet and we settled into this little house.
 My brother and I still shared a room, as we always had, and we still had each other despite another change in schools and friends.

Alec crossed over to me and ran a finger down the side of my face.

 Alec's reply shrug mirrored mine exactly and yet still turned the movement into something far more graceful and eloquent than what I'd managed.
 "Be that as it may, I think you don't give yourself enough credit for just how amazing you are."
 I felt myself start to blush as Alec disappeared into the bathroom.

That must be ended.

 Once all of Neldar is in chaos, we may proceed however we wish.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWill we strike the elves?‚Äù Qurrah asked.
 ‚ÄúWhy do you ask?‚Äù
 The half-orc laughed.
 ‚ÄúMother was an orc who had lived here in Woodhaven.
 I do not know her name, other than what she instructed my brother and I to call her: Mama Tun.
 Our father was from Woodhaven, she told us.
 We later found out he was an elf, bizarre as it seems.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou guys want to go to the park?‚Äù They both half nodded, half shrugged, which she took for a yes.
 So we got up and mounted our bikes.
 I threw the bike lock in my bag, clipped on my helmet, and followed the others.
 The three of them raced each other, but I kept my bike behind them.
 What the dwarf had said was still troubling me and I didn‚Äôt know if anyone else was feeling the same way.
 I saw Seth slow his bike down and glide next to me.
 ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúHey.‚Äù Then a question popped into my head, ‚ÄúWhat were you doing alone in the woods yesterday?‚Äù He was silent so I yelled to Emily, ‚ÄúHey, Seth‚Äôs lost for words!‚Äù Emily appeared by me and chuckled.
 ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong, Seth?

‚ÄúTake it easy, Seth.
 We can wait a minute if you need to rest,‚Äù but Seth shook his head.
 ‚ÄúNo let's move now.
 Emily, tell us what to do.‚Äù ‚ÄúAlright, boss,‚Äù she said sarcastically.
 ‚ÄúEveryone come over.‚Äù We walked over to her and the dragon with Seth leaning on Jason.
 The dragon was lying on the ground, watching us closely.
 Its long, leathery wings were tucked neatly on each of its sides.
 It snorted as Emily climbed onto its back.
 I stared at her, starting to think she was a little crazy.
 ‚ÄúCome on!‚Äù she said and patted the dragon's back.

My brother Thomas and I had become very good at yard work and chores as we learned to perform them with perfection or pay the price of Dino‚Äôs disappointment.
 Every weekend was filled with hours upon hours of yard work at Dino‚Äôs command.
 If we ran out of work to do, Dino would have us move a scrap woodpile from one end of the backyard to another, then back again if he wasn‚Äôt done with us.
 Sometimes Dino would stand in the backyard and direct us with a garden hose nozzle, spraying us from one chore to the next.
 Dino was sick.
 We never knew when we were going to get knocked across the room.
 We were often treated like unwanted animals.
 We wondered why this was happening to us but at the same time we wondered if the same thing was happening in the families across the street.
 Our half-brother, Harry (named after Dino‚Äôs father) was soon born.
 Then, my stepfather had even less regard for us as we were now second-class citizens to his ‚Äúreal‚Äù son.

How could I be put out about something I hadn't ever actually believed was possible?
 I almost refused to believe my eyes when I came around the bend in our lane and saw a black Mustang parked on the side of the road.
 Brandon stood up from where he'd been leaning against the sports car and flashed me a blinding smile.
 He moved towards me with a casual grace that made little shivers run through me despite my earlier decision not to let his interest, or lack thereof, affect me.
 "I had a bet with myself that you weren't going to wait.
 Somehow the fact I just lost doesn't matter now."
 It didn't seem possible he was talking to me, that anyone so gorgeous could mean something like that about me.
 I opened my mouth, maybe to laugh the comment off, or otherwise hedge my bets against the humiliation and inevitable mocking laughter.
 Whatever it was I'd intended on saying evaporated away the instant he reached out and slowly slid his finger down the side of my face.
 The tiny part of me that was still screaming none of this could be real was pulled along by the rest of me.

More than 40 per cent of US exports now go to developing countries and two-thirds of the increase in US exports in recent years has gone to these nations.
 The rising expectations and upward mobility of millions of people in developing countries represent a vast potential source of demand, higher incomes and jobs for the West.
 Increasing incomes among the poorest countries has the greatest multiplier effect on global aggregate demand, because even small increments in per capita income can lead to large increases in the number of households with incomes above the threshold for buying consumer goods.
 Asia is expected to generate half the growth in gross world product and world trade during the 1990s.
 This region will have one billion consumers of televisions, refrigerators and motor vehicles by the year 2000 and a rising appetite for both imported consumer and capital goods.
 East Asia alone, excluding Japan and China, will spend about $900 billion on infrastructure between 1992 and 2000.
 During this decade, China and India will add 21,000 megawatts of electricity generation every year and more telephone switching capacity than the United States and Japan combined.
 Latin America‚Äôs annual requirements for investment in power, water and sewage, telecommunications and transport infrastructure are estimated at $60 billion.
 Rising incomes and increasing exports to the dynamic economies of Asia and Latin America could generate as many as 1.7 million jobs by the end of the decade in the United States alone.
 The growth of the developing economies could provide the major impetus for economic expansion and job creation in both developed and developing countries.

Between 1990 and 2000, malnutrition declined from 21 per cent to 18 per cent of the population of developing countries, but it actually increased marginally among the least developed nations, particularly in Africa.
 Incidence of malnutrition among children under five years of age remains severe in both Africa and South Asia.
 But the problem is more complex than these numbers suggest.
 Although India is considered a food surplus state, it is home to the largest number of undernourished people in the world and access to a balanced diet and clean drinking water is far below the basic requirements for sound health.
 Projections indicate that over the next decade growth of the world‚Äôs food supply will be adequate to meet the needs of all human beings.
 The UN Millennium Development Goal of halving the number of human beings suffering from hunger and malnutrition between 1990 and 2015 is highly commendable, yet achieving it would still leave an unconscionably large number of people without adequate food.
 More can and must be done in the next decade to eradicate the scourge of hunger.
 The problem of water scarcity is even more pervasive and challenging.
 Studies indicate that by 2015 more than half the world‚Äôs population ‚Äì mostly in Africa, the Middle East, South Asia and Northern China ‚Äì will be living in countries that are ‚Äòwater-stressed‚Äô.
 In the developing world, more than 80 per cent of the water is utilized for agriculture, an unsustainable level that is depleting water tables, increasing soil salinity and accelerating erosion.

Currently, there are nearly one billion self-employed and unpaid family workers in the world, most of them self-employed farmers in developing countries.
 The self-employed represent 48 per cent of the workforce in low-income economies (less than $500 per capita GDP).
 For any strategy to be successful, it must give central importance to self-employment and entrepreneurship, with emphasis on agriculture, agro-industry and small firms in the informal sector.
 While a single approach will not be applicable to countries and regions of the world in different stages of development, a number of common principles and strategies are widely applicable.
 Agriculture as an engine
 Slightly more than half the world‚Äôs workforce, of whom 30 per cent are women, are still engaged in agriculture.
 Agriculture will remain the largest single occupation for the foreseeable future.
 For too long this sector has been regarded by planners primarily as the source of essential food production.
 Historically, agriculture has also played a major role as an engine for economic growth and employment.
 The Industrial Revolution in nineteenth-century England was spawned by rising productivity and incomes in agriculture that increased demand for manufactured goods.

eenth-century flower industry92m rapidly0m developed in the United States and its lower Midwest. In the nineteenth century, agricultural growth was pre92m-0mpost-industrial in most92m regions0m of the world.

‚ÄúWhat do you say we wrap it up for today?
 I‚Äôve got some business with Council.‚Äù I stumbled off the stool, half numb from being still so long, and made my way outside into the warm sun, unsure of my direction.
 The idea of lingering within sight of the village center didn‚Äôt have much appeal, but I was in no hurry to get back home to Fannie.
 Choosing instead a rambling, rarely used path out of the village, I found myself wandering idly through the trees and, eventually, into an abandoned, overgrown garden, where I tried to work out what to do with my now empty afternoon.
 Sitting surrounded by the various weeds, my tutor might have urged me to do something useful, like identify the species, but she wasn‚Äôt here, and I couldn‚Äôt help but attempt to repeat the process I‚Äôd used on the thistle in her study.
 I‚Äôd been warned not to practice without supervision, but the field felt alone as I concentrated on one weed and then on each of the others, spinning my charms in an attempt to develop them.
 I had no luck with the wild flowers and renegade vegetable plants, but a small thorn tree and a couple of noxious strains began to mature in response to the magic.
 All this time, I‚Äôd thought something was broken in me, that something had happened when I‚Äôd lost my mother, but maybe Junnie was right.
 Maybe I‚Äôd just needed to get my focus, to work until it came through.
 ‚ÄúWell, well, what do we have here?

She was happy when he began eating with gusto.
 "What are we going to do today?"
 "I don't know.

 She smiled.
 "Go to the shore again?"
 He groaned, pulling the blanket just low enough for her to be able to compare the skin his swimming trunks had covered with the red skin above it.

I couldn‚Äôt look away but stammered to Ruby, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening?‚Äù ‚ÄúThey are trying to overpower one another.‚Äù I could hear the pleasure in her voice.
 ‚ÄúNo silly games, just power.‚Äù The way she said it had some part of my mind wondering whether her statement about not having her mother‚Äôs ambition was true.
 But I could only concentrate on the struggle in front of me.
 No visible action.
 I tried to judge by appearance who might be winning.
 Chevelle‚Äôs jaw was set, eyes dark.
 Steed flinched, but I had no idea if it was pain or magic.
 The only thing I was sure of was that neither intended to lose.

 ‚ÄúSo what, a couple days?‚Äù

 ‚ÄúFine then,‚Äù he said.

Then the other elf was behind Harruq, stabbing at his back.
 While mad with rage, Harruq still knew very well where his opponents were.
 He spun, avoiding the thrust, and then trapped his assailant‚Äôs arm with his elbow.
 A flex of his muscles cracked bone, and the sword fell from a limp hand.
 Harruq let him go, bellowed at the first elf, and then hurled both his blades.
 They turned end over end through the air, one missing, one not.
 The one that missed sailed until it hit ground and bounced.
 The hilt of the one that did not smacked him hard in the forehead.
 The elf staggered back, swiping at Harruq as the half-orc charged.
 A thin line of blood appeared on the half-orc‚Äôs forehead, but he was oblivious to it.

Anxious to make sure I got credit for all the work I'd done, I hurried up to the front of the class before Alec could get to his feet.
 "Oh, Adriana.
 It looks like you've been busy."
 She took my handwritten report, and then held out a hand as Alec approached.
 "Somehow I rather suspect you both have the same answer, Alec just used twice as many words to get there."
 I shot Alec another dirty look, but it slid right off the armor of his arrogance.
 He nodded to Mrs. Alexander, and then slipped out of the classroom.
 "Run along, young lady, we wouldn't want you to be late for your next class."
 Spanish went about like I'd expected.

 He loaded a garbage can with old board games and school papers and gave a couple of pairs of jeans to a neighbor boy.
 He even tossed out the charred and bent pan he used to make popcorn since he had grown tall enough to reach the stovetop.
 That evening, when I called to ask if he wanted to go to the cut-rate movies or shoot pool with Billy and me, he was probably home.
 But Sylvia had gone out with Richard, and nobody answered the phone.

In fact, the feel of the warm water sliding past my skin was so incredible I almost considered skinny dipping.
 Of course that'd only lasted for about a nanosecond.
 Even in a dream, there were things that were just too scary to really entertain.
 The dream lasted longer than any of the others before it, but even so it eventually lapsed into a normal, boring dream.
 Still, I woke up feeling more refreshed and rested than any other time I could remember.
 Even more amazing, the feeling was strong enough to carry me through Biology and Mrs. Sorenson's relentless grilling.
 I did better than expected, but still not as well as I'd hoped.
 Not considering how much time I'd spent studying.
 It was like she knew exactly which parts I didn't understand completely, and after letting me start to get a little bit of false confidence, she'd hammer me down again.

"It's okay, I actually need to sit down for a minute."
 The words came out as a reflex, designed to let boys gracefully bow out of having to keep dancing with me, but a slight tremor in my legs put some truth to the polite lie.
 I really was tired.
 Even more surprising was the way that Alec held onto my hand as he led me over to a line of chairs.
 He was normally so careful not to prolong physical contact.
 Rachel and Jasmin were waiting for us as we reached the chairs.
 "Big brother, will you please take Jasmin out on the dance floor so she can get some practice following?
 I tried to lead last time and she kept tripping me."
 Alec gave me a considering look, and then nodded as I faked a smile at him and gestured my assent.
 Rachel turned to me as I suppressed a stab of jealousy.

I slid the tip of the sword across the skin above the man‚Äôs knee, making a narrow incision.

Telling her I wasn't going to be able to help out at the lab anymore had been one of the harder things I'd ever done, but she'd been surprisingly understanding.
 We'd scheduled my makeup test for the next day and I'd left with the sneaking suspicion she'd guessed more about what was really going on in Sanctuary than either pack would've liked.
 I'd been busy contemplating what Mrs. Campbell might have really figured out as we left the building, only to have Jasmin interrupt my musings with an apology of all things.
 She didn't get into specifics, and it was obvious she was still worried about the coming showdown with Brandon, but I was pretty sure she really was sorry.
 It didn't make us best friends and she was still an enigma, but it was a start.
 It even gave me hope maybe Jessica and James might eventually come around.
 I was still reeling in surprise as we walked out to the parking lot and met up with the rest of the pack, or rather the rest of the pack minus Alec.
 He'd shown up several minutes later, looking very satisfied with himself, but obviously unwilling to answer any questions.
 As we caravanned home, I realized the collection of vehicles carrying us back to Alec's estate probably cost more than my house.

His drug problem was more important than the grudge I was holding over my brother‚Äôs drug-induced antics.
 I felt like I was selling out.
 But somewhere in my heart I guess I had always hoped that Thomas and I would mend the damage between us.
 That one day I could forgive.
 That one day our families would spend a holiday together, and that holiday would lead to another and eventually things would be as normal as they could be.
 Part of me also felt that my older brother was in need of a way to get back in good graces of the family and that maybe I could give this to him by reaching out.
 I contacted Thomas in desperation, and he did have the connections to get my son into Narconon, a private rehab program that we couldn‚Äôt afford.

 Chapter 10 The rest of the afternoon finished up on a quiet note.
 After I went back to my table, Rachel worked on some homework for a few more minutes, and then gathered up her things and slipped out.
 I decided the new guy wasn't a football player when he started gathering up his books.
 No athlete in my experience ever took that many books anywhere.
 Not only that, he gently placed them in his backpack like someone who viewed the written word as his friend rather than as a necessary evil that interfered with the hero worship due him from the masses.
 I was so busy watching him that I forgot to look away when he stood up, and he caught me staring.
 I expected annoyance, or possibly some of the disdain I'd endured off and on for the last forty-eight hours.
 I didn't get either.

Marie stared at him, her eyes widening in disbelief.
 "Rick?

 Not giving him time to respond, she threw her arms around him.
 "I'm sorry."

We stayed because we had no place else to go, just as my uncle and my grandmother did.
 My grandmother was a stark contrast to my grandfather.
 She always had a bright smile and she treated us with an abundance of love.
 She was a heavy woman and her girth made her seem even shorter than she was.
 She had an infectious laugh.
 Grandma worked at a department store named Zodies.
 On occasion, my mother would take us to the store to visit her on her break.
 We would run from aisle to aisle searching for her brightly colored smock.
 One of the few times I ever remember eating out was when we shared her lunch break and ate hot dogs and popcorn at the department store cafeteria.
 I still think of Grandma whenever I walk into a discount store and smell the snack bar.

A few seconds later, it was as if nothing had ever happened.
 The ring of spectators dissolved as kids quickly returned to their tables.
 Brandon and his friends left through one set of cafeteria doors, while Alec and his friends departed through the other.
 Britney looked like she was trying to decide whether to be mad or impressed, but I felt too sick to stick around and try to nudge her in either direction.
 I mumbled something I hoped sounded intelligible and headed towards the bathroom.
 I passed Mr. Simms and another teacher on my way out, but apparently I looked as awful as I felt.
 They just shot me stern looks rather than stopping me to ask what had happened.
 It wasn't until I'd finished dry-heaving and was trying to clean myself back up, that I wondered where they'd been.
 The school building wasn't that big.

So much is lost now, so little written down, so little recorded.
 For those with the stamina to search it out, Black Lung made one album, released on the Pepper label, a little Memphis soul mixed in with their own acid-blues.
 It was called Turntable Poison.
 Some say it sounded like The Rascals crossed with Hot Tuna.
 One cut comes to mind, a piece they played in every set at The Shell, the ballad, ‚ÄúMr.
 Handy and Hakel-B√§rend.‚Äù  On the LP they insisted on the extended version with Buddy‚Äôs long, side-handed solos, slick as molten lead and the twelve minute drum solo by Skippy Quetzalcoatl, effectively killing the album‚Äôs potential sales but insuring the group a spot in infamy alongside the lost tapes of Mudboy and the Neutrons and the missing five hours of von Stroheim‚Äôs Greed.
 There was also the shorter, ‚ÄúBlues for Wendy Ward,‚Äù with its plaintive chorus, ‚ÄúThank you for at least that sweet ache,‚Äù a phrase Buddy made sound like a supplication to the gods.
 ‚ÄúWendy Ward‚Äù got some air play around the country, on the late night FM stations, a minor flickering fame which only whet Buddy‚Äôs appetite for more, for larger radio audiences, larger followings, more groupies, better food backstage.
 He wanted it all, Buddy did.

Agenda Item Two: Retrieve valuables from the pawnshop.
 The camera was sitting at a local pawnshop as collateral on a loan that expired on the very day we got there for it.
 It was the first time I had ever stepped foot in a pawnshop; it was a shit hole covered with other people‚Äôs Christmas and birthday presents.
 It was humiliating for me to be in this place and my son could not look me in the eyes the entire time we were there.
 The walls were lined with guitars, the glass counters held cameras, jewelry and trinkets of all types.
 The floors and shelves were covered with tools and equipment.
 The stuff was busting out of the place.
 The people who ran it were the lowest form of life, preying on the weak, broke and addicted.
 My son produced a crumpled receipt and for a couple hundred dollars we reclaimed his dream camera.
 I thought this camera meant the world to him.

 ‚ÄúYou smell‚Ä¶ like morning.‚Äù I bit my lip, heat rising up my neck, but he lingered, breathing in the scent.

 ‚ÄúOh.‚Äù He nodded, leaning back.

 I pressed, taking the chance.
 ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I heard movement behind me and the fear returned tenfold.
 Chevelle didn‚Äôt tense; he only let out an exasperated breath.
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine,‚Äù he said.
 He released me and I turned to see who he‚Äôd addressed.
 Four figures stood in a line, almost a formation, and they relaxed at his words.
 My arm tingled as the blood returned to the limb, freed of his harsh grip.
 Yes, he hates me.

When I finished, Eric paced again.
 Then he squatted in front of the bench where I sat and gazed hard at me, as though wondering how far I could be trusted.
 After deciding in my favor, he said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a big change coming.
 I don‚Äôt know what it will be.
 It‚Äôs something I feel so deeply, like nothing I ever felt before.

The coach and a few ROTC kids gave chase.
 They all disappeared into a stand of eucalyptus.
 Most of the teachers and ROTC tailed behind.
 Others returned to the basketball game, leaving Billy, Eric and me unguarded.
 We slipped away, into the shadows beside a row of classrooms.
 As we stood there assessing our options, Eric said, ‚ÄúGet Billy out of here.‚Äù He pointed to a parking lot.
 ‚ÄúGo down there and hide till you can hitch a ride.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre going to find Kenny?‚Äù I asked.
 ‚ÄúOr what?‚Äù Staring at his feet, kicking the dirt, Eric said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to stay and take my punishment.‚Äù ‚ÄúFor what?

The figure turned his head as if scanning for an audience.
 He found one‚Äîme.
 As his eyes hit mine, I had the feeling I was intruding, that I should look away, but something kept me staring.
 It was him again.
 Chevelle Vattier.
 I swallowed hard and forced myself to continue walking, this time determined not to trip.
 Following the path as it wound closer to them, I became excruciatingly aware it was going to split, heading to either the gate or to the library.
 I hadn‚Äôt decided how to make my escape when Chevelle turned back toward Virden and spoke something low, cutting the conversation off.
 Virden shot me one quick look and stormed into his tree.

Is he really something holy?
 Of course not.

He was introduced to many people.
 It was late as the other knights went to find sleep when both Doi‚Äôvan and Imeralda suddenly both appeared.
 He could see from their body language that they were ready to do more than congratulate him.
 CHAPTER 15 DARK SHADOWS
 Doi‚Äôvan led the three deeper into the great cathedral and said, ‚ÄúSir Rodregas, congratulations are in order for becoming a Knight of the Soaring Heavens, but I fear Van‚Äôdret is getting suspicious.
 You now have the right to enter the Chamber that holds the greater sigils.
 I think you need to go there now.‚Äù Rodregas nodded.
 ‚ÄúCan I bring you two into the Chamber as my advisors?‚Äù ‚ÄúThat does seem to be allowed,‚Äù said Imeralda, ‚ÄúTraditionally that is more about fathers with sons, not half bloods and Hellborns, but I think we might have a bigger problem.‚Äù She stopped speaking mid sentence, and Rodregas curiously looked back at her, but she was staring ahead.

 And she eventually passed on her addictions to us in one degree or another.
 Let me just say that being an asprin junkie at the age of 6 is a low point in my life, but I‚Äôm extremely proud to have beaten it.
 Well as a kid she used to scare my sister and me with horror stories about the Republican Party and conservatives in general, with the stories about rush Limbaugh being the worst of the lot.
 In fact it wasn‚Äôt until just a couple years ago that I could watch a speech by one of their number without wetting myself and shaking in fear.
 But onto other things well she always was a wonderful cook, with mushrooms and brownies being her specialties, we had those a lot, when there was enough to eat anyways.

Harruq halted before the mess that had been his prey.
 The line of undead stood motionless, their unfocused eyes looking nowhere.
 The wind blew through them, shifting their hair and whistling through the holes in their bodies.
 The half- orc said nothing, just stared at the carnage and the servants of his master as he waited for Qurrah.
 The mindless rage that had consumed him slowly faded.
 By the time his brother arrived, it was all but a memory.

Rodregas was sure everyone here had lost a loved one, at some point, to an Immortalist.
 But, no Paladin of the Gods had ever come to their rescue.
 The truth was that even if one of the gods was backing Rodregas, it was more likely to be some god who was pissed off at the Immortalists; one looking for a chosen champion for their own selfish reasons.
 As a child Rodregas had dreamed of being such a champion, but Paladin‚Äôs were always chosen from the ranks of the Order of the Soaring Heavens, and while Rodregas had once served the Order as a squire he had never came close to achieving knighthood.
 ‚ÄúAll right, Sir Paladin, I have to admit I have talked to the Sorcerer Ravenhurr a few too many times, and you definitely don‚Äôt seem to be him.
 Nevertheless, we are taking your wagon and your supplies.
 We will let you go in peace in the morning,‚Äù said Audrian in that tone of voice that implied that he just expected people to follow his orders.

 She stiffened slightly as I hugged her, but then smiled and returned the gesture with an earnestness that made me think she hadn't had much in the way of hugs in her life.
 "Well, I hope it doesn't come to that, but thanks again.

 Alec bowed his head in acquiescence, grasping my hand as he turned to leave.
 His mother grabbed his arm before he could complete the motion.

It was hard to believe this was the same person I'd had to rescue from Cassie so recently.
 I stopped Rachel just before she could put the impressive lungful of air she'd just taken in to whatever use she'd planned.
 "It's okay.
 I'm better.
 The lane's dusty and exercise would do me good."
 She hesitated, obviously torn, but my fumbling fingers finally found the unfamiliar door release and I made the decision for her.
 I swung the door open and slipped out of the car before she could respond.
 I waved goodbye with a cheery casualness I thought did a pretty good job of hiding my desire to break into tears.
 It was amazing how I'd let the numbness slip away for nothing.

The Tun brothers were not there to watch, for they had snuck back to the outer wall at Qurrah‚Äôs insistence.

 ‚ÄúHe is familiar to me, though I know him not.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt your former master, is he?‚Äù Harruq asked as he adjusted his newly acquired swords.
 He had taken a belt and some sheathes from one of the dead bodies, but he was having a devil of a time getting them to fit correctly.

We were all so closely matched sometimes it seemed like we were always scuffling to establish who was dominant."
 He'd sunk down beside me while he was talking, resting with his hands behind his head so he could look up at the few thinly-stretched clouds.
 I took the opportunity to move closer, cuddling up next to him.
 I didn't bother looking up at the sky.
 Truth be told, I had all the beauty I needed right in front of me.
 His slight start as my head came to rest on his arm was disappointing but entirely predictable.
 He adjusted my blanket slightly so it was between us and then pulled me closer.
 He was perfectly happy to touch me as long as there wasn't any actual skin on skin contact.
 Every time I pushed for more he backed away or found somewhere else he had to be.

My eyes idly traced down the page, finding blanks and almost of its own accord my pencil reached out and filled them in with words that seemed familiar, but whose meaning I couldn't seem to pin down.
 I resurfaced as I walked into the tutor lab, unsure if I'd passed anyone I should have greeted.
 I sat down at my usual spot and pulled out a book at random as Britney stomped into the room and threw her books down.
 She was obviously mad, but once again I couldn't muster enough concern to figure out what'd ticked her off.
 I blinked several times as I realized Mrs. Campbell had been speaking to me for several seconds.
 She was important, one of the few teachers that actually liked me.
 It was incredibly hard, but I focused on what she was saying, voluntarily pulling myself partway out of the wonderful cushion and exposing myself to some of the pain.

Nothing had changed.
 He threw the papers onto the desk and ran downstairs and out into the garden.
 Forcing himself to calm down, he closed his eyes and began to think about 1927.
 He imagined Marie in the dress she'd worn to and from 1927, imagined her in a speakeasy, imagined her listening to the radio in a room without a TV.
 He had a hard time concentrating and remaining calm, but he continued to conjure up the images, trying to fill in details .

 When the two tried to close in, Qurrah lashed out with his whip.

 The other managed to deflect the lash and then charge, his sword leading.
 The flaming leather curled back around like a living thing.
 Qurrah sent it at the nearest opponent.

If there was a single person in the class who¬†didn't¬†need any extra credit, it was Alec; but he calmly loaded the system with an extra sixteen grams, caught Mrs. Alexander's eye, and then smoothly started the train of weights moving up the ramp, over the wall, through the woods, and right up to Grandma's house.
 It wasn't fair that someone who missed so many days of school could be so consistently right.
 He must have an IQ of 160.
 That and an ego big enough for someone twice as smart.
 Mrs. Alexander shuffled over and smiled at the pair of us.
 "Sixteen grams.
 Most impressive, you two.
 An entire gram more than I would have ventured to risk myself, and done before anyone else.
 I thought the pair of you would make a great team."
 The easiest thing would have been to stay quiet and just let her believe I'd played an integral part of the project, but I didn't like getting credit for something I hadn't done.

The warm evening breeze carried a host of aromas too subtle for mere human noses to identify.
 In our four-footed forms each molecule was unconsciously sorted and cataloged, leaving us free to concentrate on the elusive scent of our prey.
 The other pack, a portion at least, was less than a mile away, far enough into our territory for it to be a killable offense if they were caught.
 They'd become increasingly arrogant over the last few months, but coming in close enough to threaten our families was a whole new level of provocation.
 Even their leader, Brandon, wasn't usually so bold.
 A stray eddy of wind played across my muzzle, and I knew they'd made their first mistake.
 I pressed into my second in command for a moment, conveying an order through posture and motion, and then nipped at Jasmin's heels, the two of us stretching out in a full sprint.
 Free from the others, Jasmin and I streaked through the night with a speed the rest of our pack couldn't have matched.
 Jasmin pressed at my flank, curious at my decision until she caught the scent, and then an answering growl made its way past her fangs.
 The trap was clever, but the other wolves didn't know the terrain well enough.

 What is your gut instinct about her?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 ‚ÄúWell, I am not sure if I am just doing the girl power together thing, but while she would not talk to me, I kind of like her.‚Äù Rodregas nodded, he had a similar impression.

When Celestia cursed his kind, they shared his curse.‚Äù Velixar smiled at Harruq, his eyes gleaming.
 ‚ÄúLong have I waited for someone to wield these blades.
 An elf crafted and used them in battle, an elf cursed into an orc.
 These swords can only be held by one who has the blood of both inside him.‚Äù Velixar held the hilts out to Harruq, who drew one from its sheath.
 The sword‚Äôs blade was deep black and wreathed in a soft red glow.
 He weaved it through the air, his mouth agape at the ease in which it glided.
 ‚ÄúThey are not as long as your previous weapons,‚Äù Velixar said, ‚Äúbut you will adjust.
 These blades will make you faster and more skillful than ever before.

The chaotic and destructive nature of the infernal does not lead to the necessary discipline that is required to be an Immortalist.
 A mortal must choose only one path; Celestial or Infernal.
 That is ‚ÄòThe One Law.‚Äô‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù asked Doi‚Äôvan, his deep voice sounding both menacing and curious.
 ‚ÄúNobody knows for sure,‚Äù said Jordaan.
 ‚ÄúThe Gods and Infernals do not explain their actions, but most believe that if someone had the full potential to tap into all three‚Ä¶ he would be stronger than either the Gods or the Greater Daemons.
 He would have the potential to rule all the realms and break the great balance.
 This is something that not even the Infernals want,‚Äù he added.
 Rodregas spoke, ‚ÄúSo if Ravenhurr, who was a friend of Taiga, was part of a group of Immortalists who are breaking ‚ÄòThe One Law‚Äô then he might have already added Hellborn power to his own.
 And when I took on Ravenhurr‚Äôs power, I also added the Infernal power, which is natural for a Hellborn.
 It could also be a reason that the gods answered my prayers and helped me succeed against Ravenhurr.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo the Gods might not be against all Immortalists, but just the ones who are tapping into the Infernal power?‚Äù asked Doi‚Äôvan.

As soon as Vincent was safely out of sight, everyone surged forward to congratulate Isaac on having saved Ben, and Ben on having not died.
 ** The near fight between Isaac and Vincent and then Alec's intervention seemed to be the buzz for the next two hours.
 It appeared that a lot of other people felt the same way that I did.
 Alec was plenty prickly and stuck up, but that was nothing compared to how much the average student hated Vincent, who seemed to delight in making everyone's life miserable.
 The teachers seemed curiously ignorant of everything.
 Nobody else seemed to think that was unusual, which freaked me out almost as much as Ben having nearly gone over the stairs.
 At least I didn't have to listen to all of the gossip during lunch.
 Once I'd been able to hobble down the stairs, I'd made my way to Mr. Whethers' room, and I'd spent the entire lunch break studying.
 I hadn't been especially excited at the prospect of spending that long by myself, but the cafeteria was all the way on the other side of the school.

This is one of the major reasons why expectations of a massive peace dividend have not been fulfilled.
 World military spending has not declined significantly because the competitive security paradigm remains intact.
 Steps being taken by the members of the European Union to build a truly cooperative security system indicate the right direction for the world as a whole.
 It is no wonder that the first such initiative comes in Europe, which has been the leader of thought for the past 500 years ‚Äì from the birth of modern science and parliamentary democracy to nationalism, socialism and universal education ‚Äì and which has been working for the past five decades to evolve a viable working model of fully democratic, voluntary supra-nationalism.
 Democratization of the UN: The phenomenal advance of Europe‚Äôs multi-dimensional unification is a clear indication that in future international institutions will play a more important role than national governments.
 But this can happen only to the extent that these institutions are living proponents of democratic functioning and individual freedom.
 Ten years ago ICPF called for the democratization of the United Nations by abolition of the veto power in the Security Council, induction of new members to make that body more representative, and establishment of democratically-elected representative government as an essential condition for membership or active participation in the UN system.
 The nexus between democracy and prosperity is undeniable.
 The democratic revolution that has so effectively penetrated Eastern Europe in recent years and extended its roots in other regions must be taken to its logical conclusion at the level of nations and at the level of international institutions.

These monumental achievements were not purchased without cost.
 Peace was accompanied by partial economic collapse in Eastern Europe.
 It was evident from the outset that the transition in these countries would not be smooth or easy and that the destiny of the world in the twenty-first century would be influenced decisively by the outcome.
 Severe food shortages in the Soviet Union, which angered the long-suppressed population and compelled the government to take radical action, once again highlighted the linkages between peace and food.
 Production dropped precipitously as frantic efforts were made to reverse economic decline by radical measures.
 Although these events were closely observed and strongly assisted by top international experts, the world lacked both the conceptual knowledge and the practical experience needed to guide these nations through their crisis.
 At the invitation of the Soviet Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Commission's next meeting, in November 1990, was held in Moscow: it would examine the challenges facing the USSR during the shift to democracy and a civilian market economy, and identify steps to improve the food supply, speed military conversion and ease the economic transition.
 The immediate euphoria over the rapid reduction in tensions between East and West freed public attention to focus on other pressing problems and generated great expectations that a 'peace dividend' would usher in a period of rapid economic progress for developing countries.
 Yet, despite a remarkable one-third reduction in worldwide defence spending from peak levels in the 1980s, foreign aid budgets continued to shrink.
 This prompted us to examine the potential benefits that could be derived from transferring or redirecting scientific, technological, educational and productive resources from military applications to support development and the environment.

 I could only think of our lessons, of the fire in the clearing.
 It had been so obvious once Chevelle had urged me to control a stronger flame, I guessed because I had been using the power in small doses for so long.

Then his ears heard what he had feared: something walking directly behind him.
 The others might not see him, but seeing wouldn‚Äôt be necessary if one stumbled directly atop his prone body.
 His good hand fingered the bow pinned beneath him.
 If discovered, he would die fighting.
 The footsteps neared.
 A clacking sound haunted his hearing.
 It rattled sporadically, and it was most certainly bone hitting bone.
 He imagined a loose jaw hanging by only one side, or perhaps a hand held by a thread of flesh banging against a rotted femur.
 It took all his will not to scream when a great weight pressed against his shoulder.
 The pain that exploded throughout his body was so great he blacked out as he lay there in the grass, a horde of undead searching for his wounded form.

His worn traveling clothes were gone, exchanged for dark gray and black, a leather vest covering his shirt, the laces loose at his chest.
 A long, dark cloak was clasped at his shoulders, the material thick and coarse, so unlike the soft robes the rest of council wore.
 I knew I was gaping at him, but there was something so strange about it.
 He caught my eye and I let my gaze fall to his sword belt, struggling to gather my composure.
 I had to remind myself that he despised me.
 By late afternoon, our path opened to look down on the village nestled in the rocks of a narrow valley ahead.
 Chevelle stopped on a ridge to allow us a better view.

I had a basic plan and an obvious goal but how it would unfold was a mystery.
 She met me at the door, dressed in casual sweats and no make-up.
 Despite looking a little weary, she looked like she could be very attractive if she tried.
 As I looked at her, I felt sorry for her because I knew she was about the same age as my sons and I knew she was somebody‚Äôs daughter, somebody‚Äôs baby and I also knew the sordid details of her existence.
 She led me into a surprisingly clean bedroom that had a complete bedroom set and a mirrored closet door was beside the bed.
 She pointed me towards a chair in the corner of the room and told me I could get undressed and put my clothes on the chair.
 She excused herself, telling me that she was getting a towel to cover the bed where the massage would take place.
 I thought I could hear her whispering to someone in the apartment, but I only heard her voice.
 Now I was really wondering what I had walked in to.

The city‚Äôs fear was deep enough he could sense it like a cold breeze, and he wanted it to deepen.
 An arrow whistled by, clipping his ear.
 Qurrah dropped to his knees as a second thudded into the side of a home, inches from his neck.
 A spell on his lips, he spun, grabbing chunks of dirt in his hands to use as components for a spell.
 From two windows, a pair of elves held bows, and together they pulled back the strings and released their arrows.
 The ground beneath Qurrah cracked and tore as his spell completed, so that he fell into a deep pit.
 The landing jarred his back, and he gasped for air, but for the moment he was safe from the arrows that went flying above.
 The fire continued to spread.
 Qurrah could see its flickers of light, and even in his little pit he felt the heat.
 His whole body ached, and he wished nothing more than to lay there like a corpse in a grave, but he had no time.

Her eyes met his briefly and then returned to follow the action of her hands.

 His lips were warm and strong, and his kiss made her heart flutter.
 She didn't feel the shyness she'd felt when they'd kissed before, and she was disappointed when Rick ended it.

 They had come to the same thought already.
 ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Rodregas said, ‚Äúhere.‚Äù He pulled out one of the extra short swords and its harness from where he had it stashed in the wagon and handed it to Doi‚Äôvan.
 ‚ÄúIf you guys promise not to stab me in the night, it makes sense for you two to be armed.
 Though, I do not think that harness is big enough to fit you without some work.‚Äù Rodregas held his last unclaimed short sword up and said, ‚ÄúAnd here is one for you, Imeralda.‚Äù She picked it up, but he could tell she did not know how to handle the weapon.

I was completely lost by the time we came around a corner and my inferior eyes were finally able to see the first hints of light up ahead.
 Alec slowed, to prolong the suspense as we got closer.
 Even so, it was only a few more steps before the grotto materialized out of the darkness before us.
 I'd thought it'd been breathtaking two weeks ago bathed in the light of the full moon.
 I'd been amazed at its lush beauty the couple of times I'd snuck back during the daylight.
 Neither of those compared to what greeted me now.
 Soft light came from dozens of floating lamps that'd been placed in the pool, all of which gave off an aching, white luminescence that seemed perfectly matched to the brilliant white of the rose petals scattered over the surface of the water.
 It wasn't until we got closer that I could make out the purple edging to the petals.
 "Lagrimas."
 Alec's voice was husky.

 She glanced at him.

Housekeeping rose a level, because I've discovered, like Olga did, that chores can be a swell time for contemplation.
 If you come to visit, you might find me scrubbing a floor, or dicing beats, while listening to my I-pod.
 If I don't notice your approach and look as if I'm talking to myself, don't worry.
 I'm probably communing with Jesus, though he may be in disguise.

Her hair was a nimbus of tangled nestings, life surrounded her like a cloak.
 When I went too deep she was quick to pull the plug.
 I still stay awake nights reliving the ignominy, forgetting to celebrate how we came together briefly, fiery angels.
 I think I was riffing, partly, adding to what I‚Äôd written, making it up as I went along.
 By that 16th run-through, my voice was tired anyway, and the guys were playing like they were drugged, and the song sounds like that.
 I love that cut, man.
 We hit some other place with that one.
 You wanna know about the ending‚Äîthat last bit before the hidden loop?
 Jim and I had been talking about Sergeant Pepper‚Äôs and we wanted some kind of, what they call, lamination on the end, something like what the Beatles did with ‚ÄúStrawberry Fields,‚Äù you know, sort of incorporating found sounds, etc.
 So at the end of ‚ÄúKim‚Äù we let Dickinson play with the limited equipment he had, and here‚Äôs some of the stuff that‚Äôs in that final few seconds of concrete dada: a piece of the Treasure House theme song (backwards), Crafty reading ‚ÄúThe Crucible‚Äù from our school textbook, a piece of Schoenberg, a piece from The Ventures played through some car speakers, and then some street sounds Jim got by simply walking out onto Madison Avenue with a microphone.

Rodregas held a finger to his lips and waved Imeralda deeper into the trees.
 With any luck she would be safe; it was hard to catch a Forest Nymph who was trying not to be found in the trees.
 Doi‚Äôvan stepped partly out of the shrubs and got behind a tree to give him cover against return fire.
 There was a good-size tree not far in front of the two of them.
 Rodregas put his back to it and drew his two short swords and then did the most difficult thing he could do in this situation.
 He looked at Doi‚Äôvan and not at the caravan.
 There was no need for both of them to be peeking around the trees at the caravan, though he desperately wanted to get a good look at the caravan to establish their odds.
 The dice had been rolled.
 Rodregas had been learning to trust Doi‚Äôvan and knew his life was now in Doi‚Äôvan hands.
 If Imeralda had missed something critical and they should not attack, it was for Doi‚Äôvan to catch.

Can I call you back in half an hour?"
 Mom stood there with the phone up against her ear for several seconds before shaking herself and looking at me.
 "That was some kind of promoter.
 She wants me to go out and shoot a fashion show in Paris.
 For a week and a half, and then another one in Italy.
 I've never heard of either of the shows, but she's offering me twenty thousand dollars for just three weeks."
 I felt my eyes go wide at the idea of something so unbelievable happening to us, and then even wider as I realized this must be what Alec had been referring to.
 'Convince her it's fine for her to leave' indeed.
 He hadn't been kidding about getting us out of the country.

My surprise must have bled through to my face.
 Alec's smile had a tinge of sadness to it as he led me away.
 "There's still a lot you don't know about all of the others.
 There's much I could tell you about Jasmin, but it isn't my story to share.
 Suffice it to say only Dominic has a greater capacity for empathy."
 I wanted to ask what Alec meant, but it was more and more obvious he wasn't going to answer anything he didn't want to.
 We walked in comfortable silence for several minutes before turning off into what I could only assume was the Lilac Room.
 Donovan looked up as we entered the suite.
 "I trust your mother was well, sir?"
 Alec nodded, a short choppy motion that eloquently conveyed his desire not to discuss the matter.

After dinner I was laying in bed, my mind spinning.
 I still couldn‚Äôt believe where I was going tomorrow.
 To Igneeria.
 Chapter 6
 I opened my eyes the next morning, the sun‚Äôs rays shinning through my bedroom window.
 I didn‚Äôt roll out of bed for a minute; instead I lay staring at the ceiling trying to prepare my brain for the day ahead.
 I heard my mom and dad walking downstairs, talking excitedly about where they thought I was going to go today.
 I rolled off my bed and walked sleepily over to my dresser to pull out a pair of jeans and a shirt.
 After I had pulled the shirt over my head, I grabbed my half empty traveling bag and headed down stairs.
 I dropped my bag near the door and walked over to the kitchen table.

I held my breath and tried my best to try and figure out what he was listening for, but encased as I was by the blue helmet he'd insisted on, I would've been lucky to notice if a herd of elephants had been hot on our trail.
 Several seconds passed, and then Alec smiled at me again and backed the bike into the building, which was every bit as decrepit-looking on the inside as it'd been on the outside.
 "Are we here?"
 "Disappointed?"
 I felt my skin heat up again, but managed to stick my tongue out.
 "No, we're not quite there yet, but before we continue on, I need your promise not to discuss this with anyone.
 Not even the rest of the pack."
 I was taken aback with his sudden intensity, and part of me wanted to bristle at the implication I couldn't be trusted with a secret.
 His expression softened a little as he reached into the small bag mounted on the fuel tank, and handed me a bottle of water.
 I hadn't even realized I was thirsty until that second.

I drive a lot, across the desert to visit my kids and grandson in Tucson, and all over the West and sometimes farther on vacations and book promotion tours.
 One reason I drive rather than fly is, I come closest to adoring God while on the road.
 Between cities, I plug in my I-pod.
 What goes in comes out.
 If I listen to a love song, these days I‚Äôll probably wish for a loving companion.
 If I turn on a radio talk show, I usually want to argue.
 Those pastimes aren‚Äôt good for me.
 So, on long trips in my old Toyota I listen to hymns, gospel music and such.
 As I set off on this trip, half book promotion tour and half vacation, I‚Äôm wrestling with Brother Lawrence and the question, why don‚Äôt I adore God?
 I plan to drive up the West Coast, San Diego to Seattle, and stop over with Cliff Torrey in Atascadero and Bob Williams in Portland.

However, the overall impact of manufactured exports from developing countries has been vastly exaggerated.
 Exports by the Newly Industrializing Economies to the United States have risen from 1.1 to 2.1 per cent of US GNP over the past decade.
 America‚Äôs share of trade with low-wage countries represents only 3 per cent of GDP, compared to 2 per cent in 1960.
 For the OECD as a whole, imports from low-wage countries represent only 1.5 per cent of total expenditure on goods and services.
 On the other hand, there is irrefutable evidence that expanding international trade creates large numbers of jobs, even in high-wage economies.
 The real issue, therefore, is whether the overall balance favours net job creation or net job destruction for each nation and for the global economy.
 On this issue the evidence is clear.
 Protectionism reduces overall economic welfare, often hurting those with the lowest incomes.
 In the long term greater international trade, like technology, expands overall employment opportunities substantially.
 Trade also counters the tendency of prices to increase along with incomes in more developed countries.

The sub took a desultory roll, and then waved his hands at us.
 "Her notes say you're all supposed to be able to work on some kind of group project.
 Just keep it to a dull roar."
 It was like releasing a bunch of kids in a candy store and telling them to sample whatever they wanted.
 Every single girl in the classroom but me made an instant beeline towards Alec's desk.
 The guys were a little slower, but not by much.
 For a while I tried to ignore all of the poorly disguised gushing about how brave Alec was, or attempts by the guys to recreate exactly what Alec would've done if Vincent had gone ahead and thrown a punch.
 After fifteen minutes I finally gave up, closed my book and flipped open my notebook.
 Our physics class was about the most sedate, nerdy group of people I'd yet met.
 If they were this worked up about the fight, it was a good thing I didn't share any other classes with Alec.

Where will we go if they kick us out?"
 She smoothed my hair back from my face.
 "Don't worry about that, sweetie.
 I'm sure everything will be okay.
 I was just over-reacting.
 It'll turn out to be nothing."
 It was just like Mom to misplace something important like that.
 I opened my mouth to agree with her, but stopped before the words could fully form.
 I didn't know much, but fraud wasn't the kind of thing you associated with a slap on the wrist.
 If the worst happened and Mom was going to serve jail time then we had bigger problems than even what she was admitting to.

As Mrs. Alexander stood up to take roll, a burst of static silenced us all.
 "It's my pleasure to read off the names of the five winners in our drawing for tickets to Les Mis√©rables."
 "The first winner is Pam White."
 Somewhere down the hall I heard someone yell, and then an entire class broke out into cheers.
 I knew I should be happy for Pam, but I was too busy wishing everyone would quiet down so we could hear the next name.
 Mrs. Alexander shut the door, muting the roar as Principal Gossil continued with a slight rustle of papers.
 "Also winning a ticket to Les Mis√©rables next weekend, Mr. Andrew Webbs."
 A couple of half-hearted cheers broke out towards the front of the class, but they were short-lived.
 Andrew wasn't in the class, and his friends were probably spending almost as much time thinking about their odds of still winning, as I was.
 I only had three chances left, three in two hundred assuming that everyone else in the school had entered the drawing, which was virtually guaranteed.

I knew I was larger than her so I gritted my teeth and lunged, grabbing her as I tried to figure my next move.
 She raised her face and, when her eyes met mine, they narrowed.
 Part of me was aware I should have been scared, but I was enjoying myself.
 Whatever pain I might receive didn‚Äôt factor; I had wanted to hurt this wicked little redhead since the first time I‚Äôd seen her, since her hand reached out seductively toward Chevelle and collected my ruby.
 My palms lit where they wrapped around her arms.
 I would finally burn her.
 She cocked one eyebrow at me.
 ‚ÄúHalf fire fairy, silly.‚Äù And I flew through the air to land with a heavy thump a few yards away.
 ‚ÄúWell, it was a little unconventional, but at least you‚Äôre thinking on your feet,‚Äù she mused, straightening the material of her skirt.
 And then she giggled as she realized I was, in fact, not on my feet.

‚ÄúWhat if I get five points on the hand-to-hand and five with the sword and shield and maybe two with the bow?
 Would twelve points get me to the final?‚Äù ‚ÄúUnlikely,‚Äù answered Doi‚Äôvan.

 ‚ÄúHe was once the Grand Marshal of the Order before he turned traitor and joined the Immortalists.

I wonder if Brother Lawrence, had he become Pope, would have practiced the presence of God so well.
 He wasn‚Äôt even a priest or a monk.
 He was a lay brother.
 A cook in a monastery.
 Even if I can't let go of Zo√´, I could more thoroughly rid myself of ambition.
 Maybe I should give up writing.
 Or hand over Perelandra College to someone.
 Spend more time growing vegetables and cooking from scratch, like Brother Lawrence did.
 Toni Torrey could give me gardening and cooking lessons.
 For lessons in devoting myself to communion with God, besides contemplating Brother Lawrence, I can turn to Olga.

The only change I recognized, I felt more confounded than ever.
 Someone had told me, when you drink tequila, make sure you count the shots.
 So I kept count.
 I was on seven, and still waiting for the buzz, when I sensed my stool tipping backward.
 If I had asked, once I recovered, Cliff would‚Äôve told me what else happened between the time I started tipping and the morning after.
 But I preferred not to know.
 I already had earned at least enough shame for a guy my age.
 The way I recall, I tipped backward and landed in the shotgun seat of our Chevy, where I woke up shivering.
 Dawn had commenced.
 The sky was cornflower blue.

He asked for his forgiveness and thanked him for his help and encouragement to get through this program.
 He looked at my mother, his grandmother ‚ÄúGrammy‚Äù and apologized for putting her through the same nightmare a second time, as she had been through this with my older brother, Thomas.
 He looked at Uncle Thomas and thanked him for getting him into a program that saved his life.
 He thanked staff members and students by name, as he looked them directly in the eyes.
 He made amends to all of us and he unsuccessfully tried to fight back the tears as he continued.
 He spoke candidly about all of the lessons he had learned to help him deal with a life without the need for drugs.
 He talked about how he had learned to deal with the nightmares and guilt he once drowned in drugs.
 I never thought such words of wisdom and reflection would ever come out of his mouth but they did.
 We all sobbed uncontrollably as we could now understand what demons he fought and how our son was back.
 We could finally understand drug addiction.

Oh, give me a break; he‚Äôs halfway across the village from you.
 But I was staring.
 Despite my resolve, color rose to my cheeks once more as I turned away.
 I couldn‚Äôt understand why he was affecting me this way.
 The pages stuffed in my shirt felt like fire against my skin.
 I quickened my pace, caught my toe on a root, and stumbled.
 As soon as I righted myself, I wasn‚Äôt able to stop myself from peeking back to see if he had noticed, but he was gone.

We roamed alleys and climbed hills no doubt mistaking mathematicians, who commuted daily to San Jose, for poets or novelists.
 Everybody who looked at home, we imagined had flopped in the Beat boarding houses Kerouac immortalized, or at least listened to the man speak his words in the Cellar, accompanied by a jazz riffing tenor sax.
 We overdosed on espresso.
 Then, as we climbed a hill to recover, I recited a jumble of lines I remembered from Ginsberg's Howl: "I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix, wandered around and around at midnight in the railway yard wondering where to go, and loned it through the streets of Idaho seeking visionary Indian angels, and lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup, a hopeless task, and so took ship and disappeared into the volcanoes of Mexico leaving nothing behind but the shadow of dungarees and the larva and ash of poetry..." And I recited from On the Road about the children crying in Iowa where they let the children cry and where "the evening star must be drooping and spreading her sparkler dims on the prairie, which is just before the coming of complete night that blesses the earth, darkens the all rivers, cups the peaks and folds the final shore in."
 We explored every street and alley of North Beach and drifted into Chinatown, where I imagined us meeting two exquisite immigrant girls.
 I told Eric these beauties would plead for us to steal them away from the rich devil who had enslaved and brought them from China.
 We would conspire to snatch a suitcase full of cash from the rich devil.
 Then we would speed off toward the forests of Idaho to live in dissolute passion for a while.
 As always when my mind spilled over, Eric stood by me, often wearing a smile that hinted of love.
 Back in North Beach after midnight, a couple of Finochio‚Äôs transvestite dancers waylaid us.

"I think I understand."
 He reached out to squeeze her hand.
 "I've never seen a picture of her or even heard of her, but I'd bet money that she's not as sexy as you."
 Her blush deepened, and his grin mellowed into a loving smile.
 He took her hand and pressed his lips into her palm.
 "You're the most beautiful woman in the world, Marie."
 This evening was a wonderful end to a wonderful day.
 Like the day before, what Rick had enjoyed most was seeing Marie's pleasure.
 She'd wanted to see everything, experience everything they'd let her try.
 Everyone had treated her like an eager tourist, little realizing that she was seeing it all from the perspective of someone who'd seen debuts of Hollywood's earliest offerings.

"I'll show you when we get home.
 Come on--let's go buy you some more outfits."
 He insisted on buying her a pair of pants, a dress, two t-shirts, and two pairs of shorts.
 "But Rick, what if I get back to 1927 tomorrow?"
 she protested as he paid the salesgirl.
 "Don't worry.
 I'll save the clothes for the next girl from 1927 who wanders into my garden."
 As he handed her one of the bags, he saw the consternation on her face.
 "I'm sorry, Marie," he told her as they left the store.
 "I didn't mean to make light of your predicament."

"That can wait.
 I'd rather it be just the four of us for a while."
 "Soon it'll be the six of us."
 She frowned up at her brother.
 "What do you mean?"
 "We might just have to make it a double wedding."
 Her mouth fell open.
 "You're betrothed?"
 "No, not yet.

 He caressed her cheek.
 ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs something you should think about.‚Äù  He ran his thumb over her lower lip.
 ‚ÄúYou deserve better, Marie.‚Äù  He tilted her chin up, touching his lips to hers.
 When she didn't pull away, he repeated the feather-light touch.
 He felt her breath, the quivering of her lips.
 He kissed the corner of her mouth and nuzzled her cheek.
 Gathering her closer, he began taking her lips in one soft kiss after another.
 But as her response grew warmer, his kisses became hungrier.

I'd already seen that for myself, but it was strangely exhilarating to hear him admit it.
 "You mean like werewolves?"
 There was a hiss of sound, as if I'd just hit him.
 For a second I worried I'd made him angry.
 "No, not like werewolves."
 I waited for him to elaborate.
 When the silence grew too uncomfortable I was the first to crack, just like always.
 "Did I say something wrong?"
 Alec's voice was surprisingly gentle.
 "No, you've nothing to feel sorry about.

But, then, it was like we were doing something extraordinary and perhaps not entirely wholesome.
 We drove home in compete silence.
 And when we got home, we undressed as if it were all scripted, as if this was the end of that chapter.
 And when we were both naked, we fell together into the bed.
 And we fucked and cried and cried and fucked and it was all ok.
 If only for a little while.
 It was shortly after this that I left Memphis for good.

I would return to him tomorrow, set things right.
 As I ran, I realized I was still carrying the dress with me.
 I couldn‚Äôt understand why I had bothered dragging it along, but my grip on it was tight.
 I rolled it up, tucking it under my arm as I approached the castle.
 My prison.

 I pushed the book into my pack and finally slept.
 When I woke, I felt better.

 I was hopeful this applied to my magic as well.

‚ÄúI was distracted.

 I could only stare at him, mystified.
 He explained, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too late now.
 You‚Äôll never rest until you‚Äôve followed the map.‚Äù He was wrong; I‚Äôd forgotten my plans, surrendered to my captor.
 I had thought it was over.
 ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I answered boldly, the word echoing with the thrum of my pulse.
 It made no sense, but I didn‚Äôt take the time to think it through, didn‚Äôt give him a chance to change his mind.

I kept walking, not necessarily steering closer to the three-quarter wall the boy was leaning against, but also being very careful not to go out of my way to stay further away from them either.
 As I got close to the pair, a little more of the boy became visible, reaffirming my impression that he wasn't happy to be talking to her.
 His shoulders looked unnaturally tight and he was shaking his head slowly from side to side.
 Locked as I was into my course, I couldn't help but hear them both as I got closer.
 "I can't do this, Jasmin.
 I've been meaning to tell you for a while, but I was afraid of how you'd react."
 I half stumbled at the raw pain in his voice.
 While I was still trying to recover my balance, Jasmin looked up at me, and the force of her glare almost made me fall over my feet again.
 I'd seen plenty of girls try and warn off potential competition, but I'd never seen an expression that intense.
 Despite my earlier resolve, I couldn't help myself.

Imeralda was literally flying through the air and she had her dagger drawn.
 She did not land smoothly, colliding into Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs lower body, but she instantly straightened and thrust her dagger into Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs stomach.
 The dagger did not sink far; a few inches.
 Rodregas expected Van‚Äôdret to get his hands up and fend her off, but he seemed to be in shock.
 Imeralda pulled the dagger out and then viscously stuck it back in the sorcerer, her body moved with the stroke, clearly using every ounce of strength she had.
 Still the blade only stuck in a few inches, but Van‚Äôdret screamed and fell to the floor and started to drag himself away.
 As soon as the surprisingly high pitch of Van‚Äôdret scream sounded, both Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs and Rodregas‚Äô feet were free.
 Rodregas stumbled for a moment, but was running almost, even as he caught himself.
 Imeralda was stepping forward with the dagger to finish Van‚Äôdret, but he caught her arm and said, ‚ÄúWait.

His house was big, and he had a lot of interesting things, but she didn't like being alone.
 It just made her miss her family and friends and Davis that much more.
 Hoping that television would provide the illusion of companionship and take her mind off her homesickness, she went to the living room and turned it on.
 That was where Rick found her at 5:30.
 "Hi--how was your day?"
 She turned off the TV and looked at him with wide eyes.
 "Do you know how many women there are who have love affairs with their husbands' brothers?"
 Rick groaned.
 "You've been watching talk shows."
 "There was one woman who was having an affair with her husband's 15-year-old brother!

I saw her for maybe a total of three hours during the entire two days.
 Even I knew it was wasted effort.
 If Mom somehow beat the odds, it still wasn't going to result in the kind of money we'd need to save our house.
 Not in the next two or three weeks at least.
 It felt like my whole world had just disappeared down a drain.
 I didn't suffer any real panic attacks, but more or less spent both days in a kind of despondency that wasn't much better than a full-blown attack.
 By the time Monday morning arrived I had vague memories of doing homework and not much else.
 The only positive from the whole weekend was the way my dream from Friday stayed with me.
 As I got ready for school I idly wondered if it would be possible to recreate the grotto in real life.

It is true that the UN stands for diversity and pluralism, but not when it comes to freedom and human rights.
 True pluralism and diversity can only be exercised and enjoyed by people in freedom.
 Recognizing the considerable effort that will be needed to prepare still subject people and to train national leaders in democratic institutions and processes, all possible support should be extended by the international community to make available the knowledge and skills needed to build viable political institutions.
 The UN should establish a graded, time-bound programme for the transformation of authoritarian states.
 Should the people of any country themselves prefer an alternative system, let them freely make that choice by electoral process.
 Suspension of voting rights or of the privileges of membership should be the ultimate penalty for the failure of governments to comply with this condition within a reasonable period of time.
 The affirmation of democratic principles cannot and will not stop with the domestic governance of member countries.
 It is inevitable that the same principles be extended to the relationships between the nations that make up the international community.
 The present structure of the UN system is a product of the Second World War, just as the League of Nations was of the First.
 The Allied powers conceived it at the height of the war and evolved its structure to reflect the immediate post-war realities.

"What are you looking at, freak?"
 It was hard to believe Vincent could be so nonchalant after having almost killed someone.
 It'd been an accident obviously, but still that wasn't the kind of thing you just shook off.
 All of the kids that'd been rushing forward to congratulate Isaac for his heroic save started backing away.
 Anxious to avoid the fight, I tried to move with the crowd, but felt a flash of pain as my abused ankle protested.
 For a second I couldn't think about anything other than the agony.
 When I managed to get my eyes to focus again, Vincent was only a couple of inches away from Isaac and hissing something too quiet for me to make out.
 Whatever it was, Vincent was all but foaming at the mouth while Isaac was so controlled it was hard to believe a fight was about to break out.
 As admirable as Isaac's calm was, I was actually wishing he was a little more worked up.

Fear v. Love
 While speeding on Interstate 5 north out of Sacramento past orchards and pastures, with long miles between the small towns, I think back to my talk with Toni, the part about suffering from panic attacks.
 During five of those hard years, while I taught in Chico, I often drove this highway to visit writer friends in San Francisco.
 This part of I-5 terrified me, with visions of a sudden attack that would deny me control over my mind or body, leaving me helpless and miles from the closest nurse or doctor.
 For no good reason except the fear of fear, my heart would race, my lungs and throat constrict, my hands become slick with sweat.
 I couldn‚Äôt run because I couldn‚Äôt breathe.
 I couldn't fight, because the enemy was me.
 The first time, a few years before, I landed at County Mental Health in San Diego.
 A doctor prescribed valium, which barely helped.
 For months I lived in abject fear.

The challenges posed by extremely rapid transition are nowhere more graphically depicted than in the current transition of the countries of Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the end of the Cold War and the break-up of the USSR.
 Although this transition is often described in political and economic terms, it is far broader and deeper in its implications.
 These nations are in the midst of a simultaneous multi-dimensional transformation ‚Äì politically, from authoritarian to democratic forms of government; economically, from a centrally planned command system to free market economies; industrially, from defence-oriented to consumer-oriented production; administratively, from highly centralized to decentralized systems; structurally, from state ownership of property to multiple forms of ownership in all spheres; socially, from closed and isolated to open and internationally integrated societies; culturally, from almost exclusive emphasis on values of equity and collective security to strong emphasis on the values of freedom and individual responsibility.
 The transformation of Eastern Europe and the former USSR is of vital concern to all of us.
 Never before in human history has such massive change been carried out as an essentially peaceful revolution.
 The end of apartheid in South Africa and recent progress in the Middle East show that this process continues to have beneficial repercussions around the world.
 At the same time, this incredible advance has been accompanied by events that have destabilized the political and economic systems of the entire region, led to the break-up of the USSR, war in Bosnia, the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the COMECON trade system, a massive brain drain and the threat of huge waves of economic refugees.
 These changes, too, have had implications for all nations within the region and beyond ‚Äì severely affecting trade around the world, from the tea estates of Sri Lanka and India to the wheat fields of the United States, Australia and Argentina.
 So, too, the further course of this transition will have a profound impact on all nations, both developed and developing.
 The future of world peace, the world political system and the world economy hang in the balance.

Only the top ten finishers qualified.
 There was no taking turns.
 The ten were spread out in a circle.
 In the center of the arena was a shield painted with the seal of the knighthood, a winged sword in the clouds.
 The squire who claimed that shield and made it to the Cathedral‚Äôs main hall with it would be knighted on the spot by the Knight Commander of the Order.
 This day would decide Rodregas‚Äô fate.
 It was likely to end in defeat.
 He stood flexing his sore shoulders, waiting for the flag to drop.
 Across from him was Geriodon who was standing tall and ready in his Night Bronze armor.
 He looked to have gotten much more sleep than Rodregas, and of course, now he also had a minor Sigil of Healing.

For a second my mind inhabited a body that wouldn't obey any of the normal commands.
 Fear snaked out from my center when my eyes wouldn't open, but before my heart could really start accelerating, my eyelids started functioning again.
 The desks on the route between Alec and I were lying haphazardly on their sides, but there wasn't any sign of Alec.
 Mrs. Alexander was looking down at me, concern etched into her features, and the beginnings of a crowd was starting to form as the rest of the students came over to look at the freak.
 Only something wasn't right.
 They weren't towering enough.
 When you pass out on a regular basis, you get used to finding yourself on the floor surrounded by concerned-looking people, but none of these people were looming properly.
 Everyone else having somehow gotten too short suddenly wasn't as important.
 The room was still swinging around, only now it wasn't moving, I was.
 A pair of muscular arms encircled my tingling waist and legs, holding me tightly to a near rock-hard chest as Alec deftly weaved through the approaching crowd of students.

I do feel something now and then, but I have never been tested.
 People see me and how strong I am, they just assume I don‚Äôt have magic for some reason.‚Äù ‚ÄúWish I had that problem,‚Äù Rodregas said.
 ‚ÄúI mean before, people always used to assume I had neither brawn nor brains.‚Äù With a smile he added, ‚ÄúWhat do you say?
 Shall the three of us set some time aside to teach each other what we know of magic and see what we can learn from these magic books of Ravenhurr‚Äôs?‚Äù he asked.
 ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan.
 ‚ÄúI mean, yes, I would like to learn what you can teach me.
 I like to learn,‚Äù he said slowly but carefully.
 The big guy was embarrassed.
 Then he added, ‚ÄúI am afraid my people are not big readers, and, well, they saw me as half-monster and I never learned how to read.‚Äù The last words he added very slowly, but then quickly added, ‚ÄúBut if you can teach me some basics from the oral techniques that Imeralda mentioned, I would like to learn some magic if I can.‚Äù Rodregas looked at Doi‚Äôvan; there was something about his expression, a yearning.
 ‚ÄúDo you want to learn to read?‚Äù he asked.

Rodregas quickly grabbed it as he made some room and switched his short sword to his right and the shield to his left.
 This time they spread out and started to circle.
 Rodregas took a chance before they got too close and glanced over at Doi‚Äôvan.
 In one of those weird moments that happen in battle, he saw the path between them was open.
 He was also backing up, surrounded by three more foes.
 ‚ÄúAt least they are all slavers.‚Äù Rodregas thought.
 Rodregas scooted back and said, ‚ÄúBack to back.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan gave a grunt of acknowledgement, and they faced in opposite directions.
 They were quickly surrounded.
 Another final Immortal Guard stepped into the circle, increasing the odds against them.
 Both had long swords and small shields and were dressed in the Mithril and Night Bronze half plate of the regular guard.

"I'm pretty sure Alec could take two of them, but not all three.
 They knew that, which was part of the reason they were pushing so hard."
 I felt shivers crawl up my spine, but what could someone say after something like that?
 Rachel reached over and gave me a hug.
 "Try not to think about it too much.
 Just remember that Alec's dominant to everyone here, and he'd die for either of us without even a heartbeat's worth of hesitation."
 After Rachel left I spent the next hour trying to get comfortable in Alec's desk chair.
 It was likely the discomfort was more due to the subject matter than the chair, but I just couldn't get comfortable.
 I finally moved my books over to the bed and sprawled out on it.

Rodregas tried to move but his arms refused to reach out and push the Daemon away.
 His arms felt wrong, like he had no arms to push.
 Then, true panic set in and he tried to fight his way free.
 Something was wrong, the greater sigil was not becoming part of him, he was being made part of the sigil.
 Maybe these were not like the Celestial sigils at all but some kind of Infernal trap.
 He choked, as instead of breathing air he felt liquid enter his mouth and pour into his lungs.
 He was drowning in the beast!
 He had to get out or he would die.
 He was unable to move and unable to breath and was trying to do anything to live.
 His panic faded into anger.

Sword strikes assailed her impossibly fast.
 Any thought of the fight being practice left Aurelia‚Äôs mind.
 It felt too real.
 She stayed defensive, parrying with all her skill while constantly dancing away.
 Harruq pressed closer, and every time the elf pulled out of a roll or landed from a leap backward, he was upon her.
 Notch after notch covered her staff as the swords chopped harder and harder.
 His strength grew as the fight progressed.
 He held nothing back.
 He weaved his swords through three stabs, feinted a high slash, and then twirled up and around for a low thrust.
 Aurelia fell for the feint and brought her staff up high, leaving her lower half exposed.

"Goodnight, Rick."
 She gave him a quick smile before slipping into her room.
 Rick's smile had become a frown by the time he was in his own room.
 He wasn't sure this trip was such a good idea after all.
 Sharing her dream was going to make him fall even more deeply in love with her.
 And when she left, he'd be devastated.
 But remembering the excitement on her face as she'd danced with the actor, he couldn't regret it.
 The next day they went to Universal Studios.
 "This is set up like an amusement park," Rick told her as he bought their tickets.
 "So even if it isn't authentic, I think you'll enjoy it."

Rising incomes generate higher standards and expectations, bringing changes in lifestyle that create new needs and new commercial activities.
 This process has led to enormous growth in new jobs.
 The best documented example of this process is the automotive industry.
 Inspired by the idea of making a car the working-class masses at the turn of the century could afford, Henry Ford adopted new manufacturing technology, the automated assembly line, to produce the first low-priced automobile.
 Ford‚Äôs technology increased worker productivity more than seven-fold and reduced production costs by two-thirds.
 As an immediate result, thousands of small manufacturers of custom-built cars and horse-drawn carriages were put out of business.
 But the growing demand for low-cost vehicles generated explosive growth for the industry, creating tens of thousands of new jobs in the process.
 Globally, production rose from less than 250,000 vehicles in 1910 to 42 million in 1980.
 Nine decades later, the automotive industry is still the largest manufacturing industry in the world and the single largest source of jobs in the American economy.
 Every job created in automotive manufacturing has spawned roughly ten more in related occupations.

lt reflects the enormous scale of employment trends that characterize other industries within92m the0m economy. Across metropolitan America, more than eight states have seen significant job growth at industries that employ92m more0m than two-dozen92m workers0m.<eop> While economic coverage of this core has not92m been0m comparable to manufacturing, if workers working92m in0m the

It will pass.‚Äù His words were gentle now, the anger gone.

 He didn‚Äôt respond.
 He leaned over me to straighten the bedding, his face close to mine.
 I stared at his mouth, wondering briefly what it might taste like.
 I felt a sharp pain and realized I was biting my lip.
 The thought made me giggle again, but Chevelle‚Äôs eyes shot to my face and all amusement ceased.

A part of him worried he might wake his brother, but he was too drained to care.
 ‚ÄúWhy did she do that?
 She could have run faster without the child!‚Äù
 No, he knew that answer.
 She would not abandon her child just as he would not abandon Qurrah.
 Then what was bothering him so?
 He fell to his knees and stabbed the old weapons into the dirt.
 The faces of those he had killed danced before his eyes, especially the mother and her child, and the young girl holding her little sister.
 The fear in their eyes.
 The screams.

I didn‚Äôt see the red Dodge Charger anywhere when I was pulling in and I don‚Äôt see it now.
 I scan the people around Ashley as I am pulling forward but Steve, the young man in the surveillance photo, the boyfriend and drug dealer is nowhere to be seen.
 What I can‚Äôt see worries me more than what I can as I scan my surroundings.
 Ashley continues to talk as I look directly at her, she says she will get in the car when I park and I watch her hang up the phone as she walks towards the door I am now facing.
 As Ashley reaches for the door, she brings her phone up to her ear as if she has an incoming call.
 She is close enough for me to read her lips, just in front of the truck, her hand pushing the door open.
 ‚ÄúFuck‚Äù is the only word she mouths as her eyes make contact with mine; she is immediately in a panic.
 She looks wildly at me as she turns and runs back into the Starbucks, frantically making her way through the patrons headed towards the back of the shop.
 I have no idea what just happened.
 I sit there dumbfounded, thinking the worst and that we have lost this bust forever.

Others pulled up beside a gang of thugs.
 Then we ran for our lives.
 The night Eric joined us, so did big Mike Beatty.
 He was about 6‚Äô6‚Äù, 280 pounds.
 We rode with a cabby to three motels.
 After the first, Eric said, ‚ÄúThis is bad, Ken.
 I hate this.‚Äù At the second motel, he gave the girl half his money, for nothing.
 We were leaving the third place when he asked me, ‚ÄúWhy do you do this?‚Äù "Excitement?"
 I guessed.
 Mike was sitting behind the driver‚Äôs seat.

He stared at me for several seconds, and then sat down on the bed.
 I waited, and then when I was sure that was as close as he planned on getting, I slid closer, resting my head on his arm.
 As long as I was careful not to go too far, not to touch too much of him, I could get away with that much.
 His half-imagined sigh sent little trills of satisfaction through me.
 He wasn't going to initiate contact.
 If I didn't know with an absolute certainty that he wanted to be with me, I would've despaired already.
 Still, Dominic had been right so many days ago.
 Alec was worth it, and as long as he still loved me, I was going to do my best to help him see that we belonged together.
 Human or shape shifter, homely or gorgeous, none of that mattered.
 All that mattered was he made my heart beat faster, and I could no longer imagine my life without him.

 Harruq snarled, and out came his weapons.
 He swung for her face, turning the blade at the last moment so the flat side struck her.
 The sword smacked off Aurelia‚Äôs cheek as if she were made of stone.
 The clear noise rang throughout the forest.

 Aurelia laughed.

"I swear, you've become more absentminded lately than ever before.
 As much time as you spend studying and thinking about your classes, I'm surprised they haven't decided to graduate you a year early."
 I shrugged uncomfortably.
 Since Mom hadn't been interested in the things I could safely tell her without getting grounded, school had become a standard excuse for why I was so distracted.
 "Speaking of which, when do they send out mid-term reports?"
 "I think they do them twice here.
 We missed the first batch, and the second isn't until later."
 I still didn't particularly like lying, but seemed to be doing it more and more often.

He is very powerful you know.
 We are told to do whatever he commands, but also told to stay as far away from him as possible,‚Äù said the young boy, who could not have been much more than twelve years old.
 Rodregas nodded and said, ‚ÄúSounds like good advice.‚Äù Rodregas looked up as Doi‚Äôvan and Imeralda entered the room.
 Doi‚Äôvan looked grim.
 But as Rodregas assumed no one had died, he had to smile.
 ‚ÄúIs it that bad?‚Äù he asked.
 Doi‚Äôvan missed his amused tone, or he was simply not in the mood to hear it.
 ‚ÄúThe news is not all good,‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan agreed.
 Doi‚Äôvan grabbed the far too small stool beside the bed, which was the only other piece of furniture in the little dorm room that they had been assigned.
 Rodregas knew it was only due to his visitor status and having ‚Äòservants‚Äô that he had his own room, most squires would share housing during the tournament.

"She just needs a little time.
 Donovan will alert Jasmin."
 My surprise must have bled through to my face.
 Alec's smile had a tinge of sadness to it as he led me away.
 "There's still a lot you don't know about all of the others.
 There's much I could tell you about Jasmin, but it isn't my story to share.
 Suffice it to say only Dominic has a greater capacity for empathy."
 I wanted to ask what Alec meant, but it was more and more obvious he wasn't going to answer anything he didn't want to.
 We walked in comfortable silence for several minutes before turning off into what I could only assume was the Lilac Room.

 I was miles from toot and half an ocean from weed.
 I would need Brandon to assist me with current drug terms.
 What did an Oxy look like?
 What milligram size I should say I have?
 Brandon told me that the easiest way to buy pills is from people who are prescribed them for chronic pain and intentionally demand more than they need from their doctors so they can resell them at an enormous profit.

Flying overhead, Dieredon watched the beginning of the battle with a sickness in his stomach.
 The man in black had come.
 He watched the arrows bounce off the magical shield, and then watched the human army charge and overwhelm the small elven force that had come to face them.
 ‚ÄúI will keep my word, Antonil,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúFly back to the others, Sonowin, we will battle this day.‚Äù The horse snorted, making Dieredon laugh.
 ‚ÄúNo, I am sure you won‚Äôt be hurt.‚Äù Sonowin banked, giving the elf one last view of the battle before soaring east to where the rest of the Quellan elves waited atop their magnificent pegasi.
 His horse neighed a quick question, one Dieredon wished he could laugh at.
 ‚ÄúEveryone can be killed,‚Äù he said, tying his hair behind his head.
 ‚ÄúAnd no, I have no plans of breaking my ribs again.‚Äù

He was grieving so hard‚Ä¶‚Äù His expression lost all trace of its usual cockiness as he brought back the memory.

 ‚ÄúThe irony is her tragedy gave root to the idea‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúFrey.‚Äù Chevelle was suddenly standing between us.
 I gaped up at him, the trance of Steed‚Äôs words broken.

Yes, like a child.
 A foolish, sulky child.
 Bright sun and chirping birds tore into my finally still senses.
 My eyes squinted open as I resisted the urge to stop the birds.
 It was the first time I‚Äôd slept away from my bed; disoriented, I glanced around.
 It didn‚Äôt help.
 I‚Äôd never been far from home and the new landscape was unsettling.
 But when I looked away, I noticed the neatly stacked pile of fabric and loaf of bread that had been positioned beside me.
 I silently cursed the watchers who had apparently found me during the night.
 I didn‚Äôt see them anywhere, so I assumed they‚Äôd left me out here as punishment.

As they walked out the door both cats gave him a casual glance as he held the two doors firmly closed together bracing for the weight if they threw themselves at the doors, but they just walked by and headed up the stairs.
 He wanted to follow, but Rodregas held himself back patiently waiting until it was safe.
 They might look like lions, but he knew they were smarter than any beast, and they could be setting him up.
 Finally after waiting what seemed like forever, but was probably only about twenty minutes, Rodregas slowly made his way back up through the keep.
 When he poked his head out the entrance there was no sign of Dire Cats or chickens, but he did note a few stray feathers in the courtyard.
 Other than a few alarmed sounds from the chicken coop, it was surprisingly quiet.
 Rodregas felt a feeling of relief at the idea that the lions had eaten.
 Still, he double-checked the keep and the courtyard very carefully before bringing out the cart and the horses and loading up all his booty.
 The cart groaned with the load.
 After a last check for Dire Cats in front of the keep he headed out and away from both Raven Keep and Raven Town and away from his old life.

‚ÄúRodregas, you look much better than last I saw you.
 But what is so important that it takes me away from a very important nap?‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs body looked worse for the wear, but his eyes showed his natural curiosity and intelligence.
 Rodregas did not think he actually minded coming over to his room.
 Rodregas smiled and thought that given the way Doi‚Äôvan talked about pain when training them with the staff, that he must be immune to mere pain anyhow.
 Imeralda repeated Jordaan‚Äôs question.
 ‚ÄúJordaan asked Rodregas if you two were related as being Hellborn is very rare in the Eastern Realms.‚Äù And Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs surprised expression Imeralda added, ‚ÄúWhile I cannot sense the feel and make up of a body like I can a tree, I do know the feel of magic, and I had thought a few times that I sensed the feel of Brimstone and Fire not just with Doi‚Äôvan, but with both of you.‚Äù Rodregas could feel his eyes widen as Imeralda confirmed what Jordaan had felt.
 He had been thinking while Doi‚Äôvan was being fetched and he had a question for his friend.
 ‚ÄúDoi‚Äôvan, you were swept up quickly after you entered the Eastern Realms; you clearly have a strong physical essence and strong magical power.

If I hadn't been looking down, I would have completely missed it.
 I still almost thought I'd imagined it, but there was no denying that Vincent's foot snaked out and nudged the ankle of the kid in front of him just hard enough to trip the smaller guy.
 The result was all out of proportion to what I expected.
 The smaller boy fell forward, careening towards the banister with so much force he knocked people in front of him out of the way.
 Just before I left elementary school someone had read us a newspaper article about some poor guy being pushed over a railing and falling to his death.
 I'd had nightmares for months.
 Dreams where the stairs had turned slick and I'd slid all the way down them.
 Dreams where the banister hadn't even been there and the stairs had become impossibly narrow, and nightmares where I'd somehow stumbled and started to fall over the edge of the railing.
 This was like all of those dreams put together, only happening to someone else.
 A couple of kids reached out, but the only people who could've really stopped him had already been bowled over.

‚ÄúYup.‚Äù ‚ÄúDinner‚Äôs ready in a few minutes, Jazell!‚Äù My Mom called as I climbed the stairs, eager to collapse on my bed for a few minutes.
 ‚ÄúGot it!‚Äù I called back.
 My room was painted a light green, with a bed shoved in the corner and a bookshelf overflowing with books.
 I had a small desk to the left of my bed that was piled up high with homework and random drawings.
 I threw my bag on my bed and took off my shoes.
 Then I headed back down stairs to help set the table.
 My Mom handed me some dishes and utensils.
 I set a plate down in front of my Dad.
 He frowned and pointed to my scratched shin.

What life you have ends tonight.‚Äù
 Velixar roared, a sound that made Qurrah shiver and avert his eyes.
 His master‚Äôs back was to him, so he could not see the face that Dieredon saw, which was full of rotted skin and crawling, feasting things.
 Suddenly Dieredon pulled back.
 The blades in his bow snapped inward.
 ‚ÄúArrows cannot hurt me,‚Äù Velixar mocked.
 ‚ÄúThey did not the first time.
 Why do you hope so now?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúBecause these arrows are different.‚Äù
 He fired three at once, all burying deep into Velixar‚Äôs chest.

Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs voice reflected the articulation and grace of a man who had all the time in the world to enjoy the finer things in life.

 You killed Nordien who was a friend of mine.
 You all die this day.
 There is no need for you to use deceptions or exaggerations.
 You die today either way, so speak the truth and it will be a less interesting death.‚Äù Rodregas was furious at himself to be this close to gaining a greater sigil and having achieved knighthood, and then to be caught in a hallway this close to the chamber.
 That, of course, was life.
 There were no simple victories.

Funny how I'd never realized how expressive they were.
 "Don't lie to me."
 Alec sighed, and then shrugged.
 "I'm not sure what to tell you.
 There's so much you don't know, and most of it I can't tell you.
 More importantly, you're better off not knowing."
 I waited for several seconds, expecting him to go on, and then finally realized the matter was closed as far as he was concerned.
 "Hold on there.

The shortages of jobs and the resulting poverty represent the most pressing social problem in the world today.
 But viewed in historical perspective, it is clear that substantial progress has been made during the post-war period, making humanity as a whole more prosperous than at any previous period in recorded history.
 Over the past five decades, global GDP has multiplied seven-fold.
 In spite of unprecedented population growth, per capita income has more than tripled.
 Between 1965 and 1985, real per capita consumption in the developing world rose by 70 per cent.
 Despite the paramount concern raised by the persis tence of high rates of unemployment in recent years, available data do not confirm a long-term trend towards rising rates of global unemployment.
 Prognosis for Employment in the Twenty-First Century
 Although it is difficult to make reliable employment projections based on past trends, we can say some things with a fair degree of certainty.
 In order to provide employment for every job seeker, the world needs to create approximately one billion new jobs during the next decade.
 This will require a job growth rate of more than 4 per cent per year compared to the less than 3 per cent achieved during the 1980s.

They provided a getaway car.
 Billy and I discussed and concluded Eric would explain to the teachers about how Kenny‚Äôs folks‚Äô divorce was making him crazy.
 Eric would promise to pay for the window, and get himself and Kenny pardoned.
 But somebody had called the police.
 Though Kenny ran like the cartoon mouse Speedy Gonzales, he wasn‚Äôt as good at hiding.
 The police found him crouched behind a bus bench on his way circling back to the lot where he had parked his mom‚Äôs Volkswagen.
 They consulted the witnesses and booked Kenny for vandalism.
 The teachers to whom Eric surrendered turned him over to the police, who drove him home to Sylvia and sent a report about him to the school board.
 A few days later, Eric and Kenny got expelled for having been intoxicated on school grounds.
 Mrs. Hazel Bole, our vice principal, summoned Billy and me.

 Sharp, twisted horns sat on top of its head, gleaming in the dark.

I delayed starting the car for hours, expecting he might be late, but he never showed.
 That car started for the first time since I had taught the boys to drive, and Brandon missed this moment because drugs were now more important to him than anything or anybody.
 I looked at photos of Brandon growing up and wondered if I would view them in a slideshow at his funeral.
 My marriage suffered because Lisa defended Brandon vehemently; I completely understood, because I had grown up with a similar scenario: my mother‚Äôs unwillingness to see Thomas‚Äôs problem.
 My wife and I had many confrontations, and while we both knew he had a problem we disagreed on the severity and the solution.
 Soon, Brandon moved in with his girlfriend, Tiffanie, and she was as strung out as he was.
 When they were together, they looked like two skeletons embracing.
 They had grown fuzzy around their edges; it‚Äôs difficult to describe how they clung to each other in a desperate way as if they didn‚Äôt know where one ended and the other began.
 It was more than teenage passion driving them to that; it was dependence, an unhealthy co-dependence.

The problem in the more developed countries is that the demand for low-skilled jobs declines and the gap in wages between skilled and unskilled jobs tends to increase, resulting in a decline in incomes and employment opportunities for lower levels of the population in these countries.
 This is a natural, healthy process of social development in which different sectors serve as engines for growth at different stages.
 The upward job displacement that earlier shifted job opportunities from agriculture to industry now shifts them to higher-skilled jobs in manufacturing and services.
 The negative side-effects of this process on some sections of the population alert us to areas where society must make special efforts to speed their development.
 As in the case of technology, research is needed to document this complex process across industries, between countries and over time.
 One product of these studies could be the development of specific job coefficients measuring the impact of growth in trade in different industries on overall employment.
 Trade becomes of even greater potential benefit to industrial nations during the coming decade when economic growth in these countries is expected to be significantly slower than in the developing world.
 The pent-up demand generated by the destruction of Europe during the Second World War, the rapid expansion of population during the baby boom generation, and the explosion of new technologies in the past few decades, all generated strong internal demand in the OECD countries, resulting in steady economic growth.
 The slow growth of population and productivity in more recent years means that these factors cannot be expected to drive further economic expansion at the same rate.
 In contrast, average growth rates in developing countries are expected to be two to three times higher than in the industrial nations.

While there is no scarcity of food in the world, there is also not a sufficiently organized effort to promote food security, precisely because the sense of urgency is lacking.
 Abundant opportunities exist to eradicate hunger, but in the absence of a catastrophic event, serious effort is lacking.
 Famine attracts media coverage, political and public attention, but chronic hunger does not.
 With global food surpluses accumulating, an organized effort can ensure food security for people everywhere.
 The challenge of achieving food security for all human beings is complex, for it depends on the interaction between multiple factors ‚Äì technological initiatives to produce sufficient food; economic initiatives to stimulate sufficient employment opportunities and increase purchasing power; political initiatives to maintain a peaceful and stable environment, undisturbed by war or social unrest that can interfere with food distribution; and administrative initiatives to provide for those who are unable to provide for themselves due to poverty or during times of emergency.
 Peace, democracy, employment and food security are mutually interdependent.
 The efforts proposed to promote peace, democracy and employment generation will mitigate the problem of food security to a considerable extent.
 In addition, Chapter Five of the Commission‚Äôs report highlights direct interventions that are needed to address the problem at the level of agricultural productivity, among which the following are particularly relevant in the present context:
 Farm Productivity: The attraction of high technology service industries should not blind us to the fact that a large section of humanity still depends on agriculture as its main source of income and livelihood.
 Farm productivity in these countries is typically less than a fourth or fifth the average attained by other countries.

In the research, analysis, debate, consensus-building and actual operational activities of the United Nations System, the issues of peace, develop ment and democratization have been at the forefront.
 The Members of the International Commission on Peace and Food have interacted closely with the United Nations Funds, Programmes and Specialized Agencies.
 This report brings together many of the issues which are central to the reflection on development which the United Nations is trying to encourage, leading to the World Summit on Social Development to be held in 1995.
 Boutros Boutros-Ghali Secretary General United Nations
 The report of the International Commission on Peace and Food focuses on the 'uncommon opportunities' that have arisen as the world shifts into new alignments.
 These include the chance to tackle the problems of hunger and injustice at the root of so many of the global challenges confronting us not the least, the overriding challenge of nurturing a worldwide culture of peace.
 The Commission has put people first, recognizing that the greatest potential for change is within us, that with education and information we can mobilize the vast amounts of energy and skill which are currently wasted in the scramble for survival.
 It, nevertheless, also accepts that there are no easy solutions and that concerted action is necessary on many fronts in order to untangle the tortuous connections between, for instance, defence spending and food security, for no country can truly be said to be at peace while the violence of hunger blights the life of its citizens.
 ICPF has no hesitation in putting forward ideas that are bound to unsettle, and it should be encouraged since imagination and daring are precisely what we need at the present time.
 Its calls for a standing world army, for the recognition of full employment as a fundamental right and for the elimination of protectionist trade policies to mention but a few examples will cause some sharp intakes of breath among world leaders.

The achievement of food self-sufficiency by India in a period when famine threatened millions of lives through the power of political will and scientific action in a democratic society illustrates this truth.
 In spite of such uncommon opportunities for a better common present, during the last six years the world has been witness to an escalation of ethnic and mini-conflicts, growing intolerance of diversity, the spread of small arms, an increase in violence starting with violence to oneself through drug addiction and damage to the life support systems of land, water, flora, fauna and the atmosphere.
 In addition, the current pattern of economic and technological growth is leading to gross social inequity and rising joblessness.
 The rich-poor divide is widening both within and among nations.
 At the same time, the spread of knowledge and information, particularly through the electronic media, has led to an era of rising expectations.
 The economically and socially underprivileged sections of human society are now aware that their future is not a question of fate, but of political and technological choice.
 If they are not given access to the information superhighways and other technological highways to progress, a new form of social and economic apartheid will spread, which will be even more serious in its consequences to the future of human civilization than the skin-colour-based apartheid which has just ended.
 True education is leadership in thought.
 There are periods in human history when the progress of decades can be accomplished in a few years.
 It is the view of the Commission that we have arrived at one of these great, creative moments.

This will also serve as an example and model for other countries to emulate.
 Backed by this commitment, the main elements of a successful employment strategy for India have been identified in a separate report prepared for the New Delhi meeting.
 The strategy focuses on giving an income and employment orientation to Indian agriculture, increased support for expansion of enterprises in the informal sector, broadening the on-going self-help group revolution and fully extending it to agricultural operations, upgradation and expansion of the country‚Äôs vocational training system, promotion of entrepreneurship and full utilization of information technology as a catalyst for development.
 Prospects and Emerging Opportunities
 Viewing the global employment situation as a whole, there are strong grounds for confidence in a brighter future.
 Resurgent Asia: The nations of East Asia, which went through rapid expansion followed by a major financial crisis, are back on the growth path.
 The Japanese economy is once again growing and creating new jobs, both at home and abroad, especially in China, which has become the largest destination for Japanese foreign investment and a key supplier base for Japanese manufactured goods.
 China‚Äôs economy continues to expand at more than eight per cent annually and India‚Äôs may soon achieve that rate of growth.
 Fuelled by very rapid expansion of automotive, financial services, IT, pharmaceuticals and telecommunications, India has emerged as one of the fastest growing economies in the world, the third largest destination for foreign investment, and a key player in IT and IT-enabled services.
 According to a recent study, by 2040 China and India will be the first and third largest economies in the world.

"Not an imposition.
 Never that."
 It felt wrong to try and kiss Alec right now.
 I didn't want to make light of Rachel's hurt, or Jasmin's loneliness, but his presence was too great a temptation to pass up.
 My face started out in the hollow of his neck, drinking in the ambrosia of his scent, and then moved up towards his lips without conscious decision on my part.
 Our lips met, and it felt like a warm, pleasant surge of electricity washed from my head down to the tips of my toes.
 My head started spinning almost instantly, only my hand on his chest, and his arms around my waist kept me from losing my balance completely.
 As it was, I still fell into him, overcome by weakness as my heart stopped beating altogether.
 No more than a second or two of breathlessness could have possibly passed, but Alec pulled away, firmly holding me at arm's length.

Albert, Mrs. Campbell, and the other tutor all waved goodbye as they left.
 One of the cheerleaders, a particularly whiny specimen named Jackie, wanted help, which I was happy to offer, even in my current state.
 Unfortunately she thought that meant I'd just hand over all the answers.
 We spent a good ten minutes with her trying to offer a variety of covert bribes ranging from the insignificant to things she couldn't possibly deliver.
 I kept telling her I wasn't interested and that she'd just have to do the work.
 Surprisingly enough, once she accepted that, she actually buckled down.
 It only took another ten minutes to explain the Pythagorean theory to her.
 By the time I stood up from Jackie's desk, there were only four of us left.

This was justice long overdue.
 With a quick movement of his arms and the haunting memory of the sounds of crunching and popping from all those years ago, he twisted Korin‚Äôs head nearly all the way around.
 Rodregas held his body as it spasmed wildly for a moment.
 Then the Adapt went still and limp; and Rodregas dropped him to the floor.
 Korin‚Äôs‚Äô body hit the floor and started to empty itself.
 ‚ÄúGods,‚Äù he thought and asked out loud to no one, ‚ÄúWhat did he eat this morning?‚Äù He grabbed the body and dragged it into the water closet and dropped it into the small bronze tub.
 Rodregas started to leave and then saw Korin‚Äôs purse; the Adapt was dressed for travel and Rodregas had yet to find even a single coin in the Master‚Äôs chambers.
 He reached down and took the purse off his belt.
 Rodregas opened it to find only a few silvers.
 He knew Korin should have more.

 Then my body was doing the rest.
 I felt hot and cold, as the winds seemed to pick up.

As far as reassurance went, it was a pretty lame attempt, but somehow it didn't sound so feeble when it was Brandon saying it.
 I calmed down enough to marvel at the amount of other baggage Vincent dragged out of the house, and then any chance I might have had to back out vanished as Brandon picked me up and deposited me on the tailgate of Vincent's truck.
 "Riding in the back, isn't that illegal?"
 The high-maintenance blonde Vincent was helping up next to me rolled her eyes.
 "Please."
 Brandon helped a couple of late arrivals into the pickup, and then closed the tailgate.
 I half thought he was going to ride up front in the crowded cab, but he instead cleared the sides of the truck in a jump that was almost inhumanly graceful.
 He crowded in, close enough I could feel my skin start to tingle with anticipation, and then Vincent started the engine and we were off.
 In what was probably the only display of maturity and common sense I'd ever seen out of Vincent, he didn't tear off down the freeway at eighty miles per hour.
 He was still going plenty fast, but at least the wind wasn't deafening.

Mom had exposed me to enough art for me to realize that early on.
 I lacked some kind of creative spark necessary to achieve any kind of real beauty.
 Still, I occasionally enjoyed trying to recreate something I'd seen.
 This time I didn't try to guide my hand, I just let it create lines and curves at random, until something tugged at my subconscious, and a half-formed memory began to materialize on the page before me.
 I knew that the wavy vertical line off the side was destined to become a waterfall.
 The scene was starting to take shape, but for the first time in ages I still couldn't place it.
 A mossy boulder filled itself in with feathery detail, and then I realized the center of the piece was still blank.
 It was like my subconscious hadn't ever seen that part of the landscape.
 Only that didn't make sense.

I traced the sticky metal rings and sighed.
 Emily was on her phone.
 I saw Seth and Jason arguing off to the side.
 Everything was back to normal.
 There was even a dwarf climbing the slide.
 Wait, hold on.
 A dwarf?
 I elbowed Emily in the arm, ‚ÄúUh Emily, is a dwarf using a slide a normal thing?‚Äù I nodded in the direction of the dwarf and her eyes widened in surprise.

I sought refuge in something even more mundane.
 Namely the fact that tomorrow I would have to go enroll in school and try to blend in with a bunch of small-town juniors who'd all probably known each other since they could walk.
 Going to a new school after missing the first month of classes was a prospect likely to generate anxiety in the most outgoing of teenagers, and I was far from that, but it was a different kind of worry.
 As I mapped out all of the things that could, and probably would, go wrong, I could feel my heart slowly settle back down out of my throat.
 If I were pretty or athletic I'd probably manage to fit right in.
 It always seemed like the kids who moved in partway through the year usually had some kind of instant in with the cool crowd, but that probably wouldn't happen for me.
 It wasn't that I didn't want to make friends; I just wasn't very good at it.
 My equilibrium seemed to have returned, so I took a few unsteady steps around to the back of the truck.
 If I didn't return with a box soon Mom would rush out expecting the worst.
 Unless she got caught up visualizing some new project, in which case it would be hours before she thought to come check on me.

Regulation‚Äôs drummer, poor Gyp Leach, could barely keep time on his Sears drumset, taking lessons after school at Guitar & Drum City, just progressing past a four-four beat.
 But word was spreading about this precocious guitarist who sounded like a coup de foudre, this scrawny, pimply 8th grader with licks like a junkyard dog.
 Buddy Gardner.
 It was Jim Dickinson who dubbed Buddy ‚ÄúSlipshod,‚Äù not because Buddy was a sloppy player but because he put together such sloppy groups around him.
 It mattered not to Buddy who was playing behind him.
 He was lost in the ether, playing for his own private gods, letting the Lydian reverberation carry him away, the sound coming from his own self, you see.
 Oh, of course, he knew when the bassist was faking it, or the drummer tripping over himself to keep up, or the rhythm guitarist playing the same three chords over and over, hoping his stroking would be lost in the thunder.
 Buddy knew it, but he didn‚Äôt care.
 He was soaring.
 He was making music, Memphis music, as sacred a calling as one could imagine.

She looked so chagrined that he regretted having spoiled her illusions.

 "That's so thoughtful.

 "Nope.

In strong yet gentle English, she said, ‚ÄúLet us ask Our Lady to give us her heart, so that we will offer service to the poorest of the poor.‚Äù Neither weathered skin nor stooped shoulders could alter the beauty she exhibited, as she recited from the Gospel of Matthew.
 ‚ÄúWhatever you did for the least of these brothers of mine you did for me.‚Äù Her eloquence depends upon simplicity and a talent for repeating for emphasis without condescension.
 Her message always expresses or implies that by serving the poorest of the poor, the MCs minister to Christ in his distressing disguise.
 This morning she quoted, ‚ÄúFor I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me."
 She only spoke a few minutes, yet three times she asked that we pray for the MCs and the poorest of the poor.
 I joined the receiving line.
 As those of us standing went first, it only took a few minutes, during which I received the clarity to recognize that God, the source of all power, only works through people who stand aside and let him.

The air was still as he inclined his head toward Chevelle and then turned, a long, dark braid whipping behind him as he disappeared into the brush.
 This seemed to mean something to the group, something like relief.
 I stared after him, but Anvil stepped forward, thumping his balled fist against his chest in a gesture I didn‚Äôt understand.
 Grey followed, repeating the action and adding a single nod, and Ruby clasped her hands, bouncing excitedly from heel to toe.
 I felt myself drawing back together, tied by the knots in my stomach and mind.
 A tandem wolf howl sounded in the distance.
 My stomach swam in unease.

My anger toward him returned, swift and unforgiving.
 He had been a volunteer.
 ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just go,‚Äù I said coldly, looking up the mountain.
 We rode wordlessly on as I chewed over this new knowledge.
 As my watcher, Chevelle would have been involved in the binding by Council.
 Maybe Fannie should have been punished for whatever she had done, but how could they assume I would follow in her footsteps?
 So I‚Äôd killed a bird, stolen a few papers from the council library.
 My argument faltered, so I went back to anger, betrayal that he had lied to me.
 And not just him.
 The entire village must have known I was bound, known I couldn‚Äôt perform magic, as they sat and watched me try.

She sat, immobile, watching me.

 I tried moving a stone from the ground to no avail.
 Just fire.
 I sighed.
 But Ruby looked hopeful.
 The group approached warily, keeping their eyes on me.
 Chevelle hung farther back, avoiding my gaze as he hovered near the edge of the mist.

"She's right, about how beautiful you look, Dom, if not about how pretty she is.
 James is going to pant when he sees you."
 Rachel had started prepping for the dance early, doing first her own makeup, and then Jasmin's while I was still gone with Alec.
 By the time I'd returned, Rachel's youthful features had taken on a mature cast that'd make all kinds of boys wish they'd taken a risk and asked Alec's little sister out.
 Jasmin had about the least reason out of any girl alive to be an expert hair dresser since her naturally wavy hair could just air dry and still look like she'd spent hours working on it, but an expert she was.
 The results of her efforts on Rachel's behalf were nothing less than spectacular, and the casual-looking knot of curls and twists was wispy in all the right places.
 Even with Rachel currently an order of magnitude hotter than normal, Jasmin still captured the prize.
 Rachel's work on her behalf had resulted in a makeup job that was so incredibly understated, even us girls had a hard time detecting it.
 Her wavy brunette hair had been straightened and pulled back in what looked like an attempt to let some other girls shine for a change, but it just made her look like a goddess who'd decided to spend the night slumming.
 Given who she'd spent the last hour being surrounded by, it was no wonder Dominic was worried she was the ugly step sister.

 ‚ÄúUnless you two were not talking-‚Äù ‚ÄúGod no, Emily!‚Äù I interrupted her.
 ‚ÄúNo way, we were just trying to get away from you two because I just woke up and you guys are really loud first thing in the morning.‚Äù She sighed.
 ‚ÄúFine, don't bite my head off Jazell, I was just asking a question.‚Äù Then she turned and disappeared back in the cave.
 Seth let out a huge breath.
 ‚ÄúWow, I'm glad she left.

 Her boots splashed in the melted snow again, and I sent the icy water racing up under the material of her skirt to her bare legs.
 Shock crossed her face and I hoped it would buy the time I needed.

They didn't even acknowledge the possibility unless they were after something.

Still, more than 800 million people spread throughout the developing world lack sufficient and secure access to nutritious food and clean drinking water.
 Between 1990 and 2000, malnutrition declined from 21 per cent to 18 per cent of the population of developing countries, but it actually increased marginally among the least developed nations, particularly in Africa.
 Incidence of malnutrition among children under five years of age remains severe in both Africa and South Asia.
 But the problem is more complex than these numbers suggest.
 Although India is considered a food surplus state, it is home to the largest number of undernourished people in the world and access to a balanced diet and clean drinking water is far below the basic requirements for sound health.
 Projections indicate that over the next decade growth of the world‚Äôs food supply will be adequate to meet the needs of all human beings.
 The UN Millennium Development Goal of halving the number of human beings suffering from hunger and malnutrition between 1990 and 2015 is highly commendable, yet achieving it would still leave an unconscionably large number of people without adequate food.
 More can and must be done in the next decade to eradicate the scourge of hunger.
 The problem of water scarcity is even more pervasive and challenging.
 Studies indicate that by 2015 more than half the world‚Äôs population ‚Äì mostly in Africa, the Middle East, South Asia and Northern China ‚Äì will be living in countries that are ‚Äòwater-stressed‚Äô.

My friend Diane Otocar, a lay sister with Mother Teresa‚Äôs Missionaries of Charity, told me about a fellow who asked Mother what he should do for her and her ministry.
 ‚ÄúDo you have a family?‚Äù she asked.
 ‚ÄúI do,‚Äù he admitted.
 She said, ‚ÄúFirst, take care of your family.‚Äù "So there," I mumble.
 Out of all the people since Jesus, I can‚Äôt think of any whose advice I should trust more than Mother Teresa‚Äôs.
 But I know we humans can talk ourselves into or out of most anything.
 Books
 One reason I decided to arrange a book signing in Seattle was so I could visit Jaime and Mark Baird and meet their one-year-old Gavin.
 Not long ago, Mark did a tour as an Army psychologist in Iraq.
 Jaime recently earned a Master of Arts degree from Perelandra College, which Pam and I founded about eight years ago, and which I essentially run.

I moved closer to the window, finding a larger gap there.
 ‚ÄúWere you able to track her?‚Äù Junnie asked in a low voice.
 ‚ÄúNot exactly.
 She‚Äôs following me.‚Äù Heat flooded my face.
 I couldn‚Äôt believe he‚Äôd fooled me again.
 I didn‚Äôt care what else they had to say.
 I stood and marched away, fuming at the idea that both of them were in on it.
 They might have been council, but it didn‚Äôt stop the feeling of betrayal.
 They‚Äôd lied to me, acted as if they‚Äôd cared.
 I was done with them.

My father‚Äôs face was indescribable, his fury almost tangible.
 I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to look away from him, but I saw Rune standing in my peripheral vision.
 I was caught.
 I frantically searched for some explanation.
 But he didn‚Äôt speak.
 He flipped his arm, dismissing me.
 The tension showed in that small movement and I blanched.
 I started to pull away from the guard but he didn‚Äôt release me.
 I realized then I hadn‚Äôt been dismissed.
 It had been a direction for the guard.

We chose one of the quieter nightclubs.
 Still, it was crowded, so we shared a table with two friendly Marines.
 In a few months, Cliff would get drafted.
 Neither of us were anxious to shoot anybody or die as heroes.
 But Cliff‚Äôs dad fought in Korea and wasted no respect on anybody who let other boys go to war while he attended college.
 Even before our tequila arrived, the Marines were telling us about a training film.
 It showed photos of camouflaged pits where guys fell onto sharpened and poisoned poles, and tunnels through which soldiers had to crawl chasing invisible warriors.
 Maybe the thoughts of death by poison or stabs in the dark made my stomach roil.
 Or maybe the cause was the sight of a dancer on the stage beside the bar.
 She was naked except panties sagged around her knees.

Her staff collided with his ribs.
 He curled up at the blow, crying out in pain.
 Guess not, she thought.
 A shove put him on his back.
 He pleaded to her, sputtering blood, but she ignored him.
 ‚ÄúSome people should not reproduce,‚Äù she said.
 Down came her staff, all her might behind it.
 The end smashed his genitals, eliciting a cry of pain beyond anything her spells could do.

While I was still trying to recover my balance, Jasmin looked up at me, and the force of her glare almost made me fall over my feet again.
 I'd seen plenty of girls try and warn off potential competition, but I'd never seen an expression that intense.
 Despite my earlier resolve, I couldn't help myself.
 I veered further away from the pair as some primitive, survival-minded part of my subconscious sought to create a buffer between me and the girl who looked ready to rip out my throat.
 I'd gone far enough I couldn't see either of them, but it honestly felt like Jasmin watched me all the way until I managed to make it safely out of sight.
 I'd read stories where people claimed to have felt someone's gaze trying to bore a hole in their back, but this was the first time I'd ever experienced it for myself.
 I hadn't even believed it was possible, but the pins and needles I'd felt starting the second she'd looked up hadn't disappeared until I put a brick wall between us.
 Biology would've been unpleasant even without everything else that was going on.
 The air conditioning was out to part of the building, and Mrs. Sorenson's classroom was one of the ones that apparently were going to go without until they got the regulator or switcher, or whatever it was, fixed.

But what Doi‚Äôvan said to him was, ‚ÄúWhere is Imeralda?‚Äù At these words Rodregas whirled around and looked around throughout the great chamber.
 Both of their eyes were drawn to where they heard a third door being opened.
 As they had found a door smelling of the fires of hell, so apparently had Imeralda found a door.
 She was opening hers.
 They both ran to catch up with her before she got in.
 They dared not run full out as they dodged around the greater sigils, knowing any touch would be permanent.
 They were not in time to stop Imeralda from entering through the hidden door.
 Rodregas could feel Imeralda in front of him, but she and the doors seemed to disappear.
 His eyes seemed of no use so he closed them and simply walked toward where he knew she was.
 He felt Doi‚Äôvan grab onto his shoulder and follow him.

Mom hadn't even apologized.
 She'd mumbled something about needing to hit one of her 'close' sites while the moon was still high in the sky as she dropped me off at home and then drove off without looking back.
 I'd just managed to drop off into a fitful sleep when she came back home and ruined any chance of me catching up on the sleep I'd missed because of the trip.
 I'd never been able to go back to sleep after being woken up in the morning, but I tried anyways.
 By the time I finally gave up and got out of bed I was not a happy camper.
 I was even less so by the time Mom finally woke up.
 Rachel not having been at Les Mis√©rables had been preying on my mind the whole time I'd been studying, and since Brandon wouldn't work for girl talk, I needed to hash it all out with my mom.
 Only she was so far gone, getting anything out of her was all but impossible.
 She interrupted partway through my description of what'd happened to ask if I'd noticed when the light outside my bedroom had stopped working.
 As if I cared when some stupid bulb burned out.

Apparently, Carol asked to meet me.
 Like a fan thing.
 But, man, it was love, lust, whatever, at first sight.

 What a body she had, has, lovely lovely woman.
 God, I still could get horny for her.

He would sometimes bring food we were not accustomed to eating, like steak.
 I had no memory of any man ever giving us a gift or anything of the sort before, but occasionally he would bring us a trinket to our mother‚Äôs delight.
 He was a big man with a dark complexion and jet-black hair and he would often talk on the phone in his native Greek.
 Thomas and I had never heard someone speak in a foreign language so it was intriguing.
 My mom soon married Dino and we officially had a stepfather.
 Shortly after they were married we moved north to Sacramento.
 It was a six-hour drive from where my grandparents and uncle lived.
 We said our goodbyes to our sobbing grandmother and to all our friends and entered a new chapter in our lives.

It began with a nuclear war.
 The human race died from north to south, until all that remained of humanity were some outposts in Australia, where foreign Navy ships had anchored.
 One by one the heroes expired, while the band played ‚ÄúWaltzing Matilda.‚Äù Cliff asked if we would go running with him on the cross-country course at Balboa Park, near downtown San Diego, where the previous year he had scored his only first-place finish.
 He wanted to run there one last time, before the end of the world.
 We parked on a mesa overlooking Balboa Stadium, to which Billy Graham would come later that year.
 We set off jogging through the dark canyons and oak groves, alongside the zoo where tropical night birds hooted and the gibbons chattered as though outraged.
 I huffed and panted while Cliff and Eric bounded as if every stride was downhill, yet for 2.3 miles I managed to keep up and sing along with our chorus of ‚ÄúWaltzing Matilda.‚Äù From then on, for us, to be on the beach meant something new.
 Besides tumbling through the waves, watching girls who filled us with trepidation and awe, dreaming of far places and freedom, it meant staring at the opaque sheen of eternity.

It is not fully developed in the form of practically useful knowledge.
 An educational system that endows the individual with the capacity for physical accomplishment, psychological fulfilment and original thinking would enable society consciously to abridge the development process and accomplish goals within one or a few decades that would otherwise take place over the span of a century or more.
 We believe that it is possible to fashion a system that directly prepares students for life in the twenty-first century, because the necessary knowledge already exists subconsciously in society and consciously in a few stray individuals or social groups.
 Materially, the world already possesses the knowledge needed to produce sufficient food and other necessities to eradicate poverty from the earth, but this knowledge is not yet a conscious possession of humanity as a whole that is passed on to every individual, even in the most advanced nations.
 Socially, every culture possesses the knowledge of the essential qualities necessary for lasting success.
 This knowledge, if consciously formulated, can be systematically imparted to the entire population through formal education.
 Psychologically, the right attitudes, values and motives enable the individual to attain a self-existent happiness and inner harmony which nothing can disturb.
 This knowledge too can be consciously formulated and communicated through the educational system of the twenty-first century.
 Mentally, our knowledge is partial, biased and largely dependent on social status and opinion, rather than purely rational criteria.
 True mental objectivity can be taught.

We know that the practice of turning your busted drug users and dealers into snitches was nothing new in the world of illegal drug distribution.

 Maybe this was somehow Karma.
 They certainly don‚Äôt have a book that can teach you how to be a good father and my own experiences as a son and a stepson had only given me insight on what not to do as a father.

 Her squad danced at basketball games.
 If I attended, she would wave and smile at me.
 On a Friday evening, Eric, Kenny Neidermeyer, Bill Torrey and I split a magnum of champagne on the pretense of celebrating Kenny‚Äôs parents‚Äô divorce, which had gotten finalized that week.
 We had no other plans, so I suggested we visit the basketball game, since Karen‚Äôs wave and smile might revive my hope and cheer me.

She'd been too preoccupied to really think much about it, but now she reflected on his lovely blue eyes, his perfect features, his smile.

 Her own betrothed fled at even a hint of tears, but Rick had held her and stroked her hair.
 That was a highly improper action, of course, but then, this was a situation for which no etiquette had ever been designed.
 And besides, it had felt so good.
 The water was cooling, so she rapidly bathed, washed her clothes, and stepped out of the tub.
 The bath towel was big and fluffy and felt wonderful against her skin.

The officer said they had less than half of the money, which she had attempted to hide in a trash can in the Starbucks‚Äô bathroom, and Steve had a gun, which Ashley admitted they would have used if I didn‚Äôt give them the drugs once I discovered they were short on cash.

 Part II: After the Bust Chapter 21: When You Least Expect It The next morning I woke up before my wife and son.
 After I brewed my morning coffee, I walked down the hall and back into my bedroom where I kept the drug test in my closet.
 I walked into Brandon‚Äôs room and told him to wake up and urinate in the test cup.
 It was still early and he begged me to let him sleep a little longer, saying he hadn‚Äôt slept well.
 I insisted, and told him he could lie back down after the test.
 Since I knew he had a device called a Wizinator that is sold at smoke shops to look like you are pissing‚Äîit has a bag filled with either synthetic urine or someone else‚Äôs‚ÄîI made him show me he was really pissing.

By now some of the sharper edges to the emotion had worn away.
 I shrugged, dropping my book and binder on the floor next to my bed.
 Dwelling on the guilt would just make me think about why I felt guilty in the first place.
 I'd find myself on the floor with no memory of how I'd gotten there.
 By the time I'd brushed my teeth and finished the rest of my nightly ritual, my mind was wholly in the present, and I was starting to get a little depressed.
 I'd never particularly fit in back home, but there'd been enough other people in various fringe groups that I'd always felt like I had somewhere to go if I ever wanted more friends.
 I would've had to play a role to a certain extent, which was why I'd never made the effort, but the option had always been there.
 It didn't look like that'd be a possibility in Sanctuary.
 In an entire day I'd had exactly one person try and befriend me.

Everyone else was harder to pick out, but I gave it my best shot.
 Isaac was probably the bluish-black hybrid who was nearly as big as Alec.
 His utter stillness in comparison to the constant motion of the rest of the pack was too much like his normal self-mastery for it to be anyone else.
 The other hybrid, the gray one with his teeth showing and just the barest hint of a growl had to be James.
 Jessica was obviously the smallest of the wolves.
 She paced back and forth, her eyes never leaving me as she made it entirely evident she'd like nothing more than to give into countless millennia of instincts, and just rip my throat out in a single lightning-fast bound.
 It wasn't until I tried to decide which of the two remaining wolves was Dominic, that I realized the next smallest figure wasn't a wolf at all.
 The pitch-black shadow that padded towards me was some kind of cross between a leopard and a jaguar.
 A low growl rippled up out of Alec's throat as the large cat got closer, but she dropped to the ground and rolled onto her back.
 I started forward, but Donovan's hand closed around my arm, pulling me up short.

He looked down at Aurelia with a mixture of anger and embarrassment.

I wasn't about to pry if there was something she didn't want to tell me.
 "I guess that's fair.
 Let me know if you have any more questions."
 Rachel nodded, and then turned back to her book, apparently having used up her store of courage for the afternoon.
 I stopped by Britney's desk to ask if she needed any help, and had to avoid an attempt to suck me into another gripe session about Mrs. Campbell.
 Satisfied that there wasn't anything I needed to be doing to help either of the other girls, and that they'd let me know if that changed, I broke out my Spanish book and reviewed some more vocabulary.
 Despite my growing hatred for Mrs. Tiggs, I managed to get deep enough into my Spanish homework to lose track of time.
 When I finally surfaced from abeja, camisa, and reloj it was just five minutes before I was supposed to close up for the afternoon.
 Rachel pulled her things together and left while I was straightening up the chairs.
 It was petty, but I waited inside the room until the clock showed exactly the time the lab was supposed to finish, and then joined Britney outside in the oppressive heat.

A few seconds later the pair was screaming out of the parking lot, and my breathing was too labored for it to be anything other than a full-blown panic attack.
 I made it another couple steps, just far enough to grab Britney as I started to fall.
 I had a split second to be grateful I'd lost all of that weight so Britney wouldn't collapse under me, and then the darkness claimed me.
 Even though I knew I wouldn't remember the void when I finally came to, I wanted nothing more than to just float in the darkness.
 It had been a hard day.
 I'd....actually I wasn't sure why it'd been a hard day, but something told me I'd unconsciously been at the end of my rope just before I'd collapsed.
 Unfortunately that same thing told me I couldn't dwell here in the comforting absence, there was a very important reason for me to regain my feet.
 The void was reluctant to let me go, stripping me of memories and experiences as I fought my way free.
 By the time I was near surfacing I no longer remembered just how much I'd wanted to stay.
 Britney was pacing back and forth when I opened my eyes.

The entire pack trooped into the room, filling it with impeccably dressed, mostly gorgeous, shape shifters, who gave off a perceptible tingle of energy if you knew what to look for.
 I'd really thought Alec was tilting at windmills right up until he politely, but firmly asked for a brief meeting with the principal and was ushered into the other man's office five seconds later.
 Alec drew the blinds, which didn't do anything to muffle the principal's raised voice.
 Fifteen minutes later, after the unmistakable feeling of Alec's power had crested to the point where it almost felt like there was a breeze blowing from the office, we were all sitting down with the bewildered school counselor and playing musical classes.
 Only it turned out Rachel and I were the only ones not changing our schedules.
 I started to protest being treated differently than everyone else, only to feel my mouth click shut as Rachel shook her head at me.
 It wasn't until Alec was walking me to Biology that I finally got an explanation.
 "You and Rachel are the ones who need the most sleep, ergo you don't change classes."
 "That's crazy."
 I would've stopped.

After all, I'd already been diagnosed with the kind of clinical condition nobody with less than eight years of school could even pronounce.
 As amusing as my internal monologue was, I didn't let it slow my normal morning preparations.
 Almost before I knew it, I was downstairs and once again facing the dreaded decision of whether or not to eat breakfast.
 I already knew I wasn't hungry; the only real decision was how much of Mom's wrath I was willing to face later on.
 It wasn't until I had my hand on the doorknob that I remembered Brandon's promise to pick me up.
 I was so tired I actually considered for a second that he might have been serious.
 Sitting in his car, fighting not to look at his smiling gray eyes, it'd all seemed so reasonable.
 I'd lost my ride and he was grateful I'd saved him from having to interfere with Cassie, so he was going to become my personal chauffeur for the rest of the year.
 Looking at my empty lane, the school bus only minutes away, it seemed more likely Brandon wouldn't even remember talking to me.

I looked over at Rachel's concerned face and opened my mouth to thank her for whispering, for keeping my secret, only the words didn't come out.
 Instead the image of Alec, the one that had burned itself onto my retinas a few seconds previously just as it had done in physics when I'd looked over to see his broken pencil, flared back into life before my eyes.
 "You knew there was another time.
 Alec told you about Physics."
 Rachel opened her mouth, probably to deny it, but the look in her eyes told me it was true.
 She couldn't possibly be that scared about me putting two and two together if he'd been saying nice things about me.
 He hated me, and she was scared of him, scared of what he'd do if he found out she'd let his secret slip.
 "It's not like that, Adri.
 It's..." I didn't even have to cut her off.
 She couldn't finish her own thought, couldn't come up with a lie that was believable.

When she didn't pull away, he repeated the feather-light touch.
 He felt her breath, the quivering of her lips.
 He kissed the corner of her mouth and nuzzled her cheek.
 Gathering her closer, he began taking her lips in one soft kiss after another.
 But as her response grew warmer, his kisses became hungrier.
 Marie was growing hot and felt almost drugged by Rick's kisses.
 She ran one hand over his chest, wishing that his shirt had buttons so that she could undo one and slip her hand inside.
 If--oh!
 The tip of Rick's tongue was touching her lower lip.
 But she wasn't repulsed.

Arguments are often advanced that nuclear weapons cannot be ‚Äòdis-invented‚Äô, and that the danger of a rogue state or terrorist group acquiring and threatening use of these weapons necessitates that the present nuclear powers retain them for such a contingency.
 With the massive conventional firepower already available, nuclear weapons are not needed for defence, even against a rogue state with nuclear capability, and they do not represent a credible defence against terrorism under any circumstances.
 How could nuclear weapons conceivably be used to retaliate against terrorism?
 Alternative solutions can be found to address these threats far more effectively.
 Similar arguments were made in the past against complete eradication of chemical weapons.
 The new treaty for the abolition of chemical weapons provides a useful model.
 Chemical weapons technology is far easier to acquire and violations of the treaty are far more difficult to verify.
 The fact that a comprehensive universal treaty to abolish one category of weapons of mass destruction is now a reality proves that political will rather than technical factors is the crucial element.
 The Chemical Weapons Treaty also shows that negotiation of such a treaty need not take decades.
 The demise of the Cold War offers a unique opportunity to eliminate nuclear weapons while the political atmosphere is favourable.

_They clearly love each other,_ thought Aurelia.
 _Maybe Harruq more than Qurrah._
 The day passed, and it was thankfully uneventful.

Only somehow the sun had disappeared, replaced by the paler, colder light of the moon.
 The trees were still graceful strands of light, but the breeze had changed to a harsh thing, one carrying new scents that somehow represented danger.
 Something inside me forced my limbs into motion.
 I was running before the first howl tore through the night.
 I was moving unimaginably fast, jumping fallen trees and bounding over other obstacles which even my improved vision struggled to make out in time for me to avoid them.
 The speed of my passage wrung tears from my eyes, but I didn't dare slow.
 They were back there, four of them moving with speed only slightly less than my own, noses to the ground to follow my scent, save for the moments in which they let loose their unearthly howls.
 A flicker of motion up ahead should have made me pull up in fear, but the smell accompanying it was somehow familiar, somehow safe.
 I knew if I could reach the shadowy person I'd been unconsciously following, I'd be safe, but he was so incredibly fast and my pursuers were gaining.

Past experience had pretty much established that when Britney got like this there was no reasoning with her.
 Trying to explain that she hadn't seen the look from my end, that Isaac most definitely hadn't been attracted to me, would be useless.
 I was pleasantly surprised when Britney's annoyance seemed to have blown over by the time we left the building.
 Before we'd even made it out of the parking lot, Britney was once again chattering about everyone else in the school and what they were or weren't doing lately.
 Considering that I still couldn't put a face with most of the names she was tossing around, the gossip wasn't just uninteresting, it was a near ordeal.
 It wasn't until I looked over at the speedometer that I realized we really had been driving longer than normal rather than the gossip just making it seem to take forever.
 Britney caught me registering the fact she was driving under the speed limit for the first time I could remember, and broke off recounting Amy Stevens' supposed fling with one of the football players just long enough to blush.
 "I figured I should be more careful of how fast I drive.

We even told our children that if Uncle Thomas came to our house or ever tried to get them in a car that they were to run to any other adult.
 We did not know what drug he was on or how far he would go.
 When he moved to southern California, we were not faced with Thomas‚Äôs problems anymore.
 I crossed him off of my list‚Äîthe brother who had stood shoulder to shoulder with me through all the moves, the abuse, and so much else.
 The brother who for a while was all I had was completely estranged from me.
 I had put Thomas in a similar category as my biological Father, Richard.
 I considered that in both of their cases, nothing good seemed to happen when I associated with them so I just kept them out of my life and my family‚Äôs as well.
 The latest stories I had heard about Thomas were that while at one point he had escalated his abuse to injecting heroin, he then attended a drug rehab center called Narconon, which had apparently enabled him to be clean for the last couple of years.
 If this was true, and he was clean, maybe he‚Äôd be a good person to go to for help?
 My mother thought so, and she insisted that we reach out to him.

In the new political climate, reforms will be successful only in the measure that they are understood and accepted by the population.
 The vitality of the market depends on releasing the initiative of people to act in their own perceived best interests by producing and distributing goods and services for consumption by others.
 This initiative cannot be ordered, it can only be encouraged.
 Economic policy recommendations failed adequately to anticipate either the impact of the programme on the people or their reaction to it.
 In the early stages of reform, the public exhibited an incredible degree of patience, tolerance and endurance under conditions of growing hardship.
 Gradually public resentment and personal suffering (especially for the aged, children and new entrants to the work force) became so severe in some countries that no government could have sustained the programme without facing political upheaval or violent revolution.
 There is some truth in the argument that ‚Äòshock therapy‚Äô did not fail in Russia and other countries, because it was never actually implemented.
 At each crucial juncture either the central bank or the government pulled back from enforcing the necessary fiscal discipline.
 But it is equally true that ‚Äòshock therapy‚Äô never could have been implemented by a democratic government, when it imposed such enormous hardship on the people and generated a polarization and fragmentation of political forces within the country.
 Where similar strategies have succeeded in other parts of the world, it has usually been under authoritarian governments, such as in Chile.

‚ÄúNow we‚Äôll finally see,‚Äù Qurrah said, ‚Äúwhat we are, what we are meant to be.‚Äù
 Thousands of orcs spilled into the west, needing no light to see in the darkness.
 They howled and cheered, drums and war chants mixing with the shrieks of the skulls.
 Harruq felt his temples throb.
 A wail rolled over him as a deathly comet swirled about, spotting the two and eying them like prey.
 Try as he might, he couldn‚Äôt stop from shaking.
 ‚ÄúCan you stop them?‚Äù Harruq asked, squinting at the sky.
 ‚ÄúPerhaps,‚Äù said Qurrah, eyes distant and unfocused.
 ‚ÄúBut orcs don‚Äôt use necromancy, not if the stories I‚Äôve heard are true.
 Someone else travels with them‚Äîsomeone who must be strong.‚Äù

I imagine Eric sitting beside me, wearing the same face as after he pinned me to his living room floor, just before he coached me to believe in myself no matter the evidence that I was a loser.
 Then the expression changes to the one I imagine him wearing when he told Kenny they needed to leave for the desert without Billy and me.
 I get a crazy idea I have never considered before.
 Because Eric and Olga would have loved each other, I bring Olga out of the air and onto the lounge chair beside Eric.
 I give her the face of her last whole day, while she reclined on the couch in the office we were using as a church.
 After some weeks of hideous pain and frustration that prayers weren‚Äôt healing her cancer, that morning she watched us with a deep serenity and graced us with outrageous love.
 Now that I‚Äôve coached myself to talk to Jesus in Eric and Jesus in Olga, and God in Jesus, not only does it no longer feel neurotic or blasphemous.
 Instead, it seems just right.
 Because the more I do this, and I do it most every time I pray, the more Olga and Eric appear to fade, almost as if they become part of the sky, until all that‚Äôs left are their beautiful faces, and then I lose sight of the faces and all that remains are the attitudes those faces reveal, and what I perceive is willingness to sacrifice for me and others.
 Eric in his way, Olga in hers.

5.Improve access to markets: The most important structural change in the world economy over the past 35 years has been the five-fold increase in the world share of manu factured exports gained by the developing countries as a group, up from 4 per cent to 19 per cent, compared with a current market share of about 13 per cent each of the United States and for Japan.
 Although 54 per cent of these manufactures come from five top exporting countries, a large number of countries export more than $1 billion in this category annually.
 This has opened the door for self-reliant growth in many developing countries.
 This growth could have been considerably more impressive but for constraints placed on it by both tariff and, particularly, non-tariff barriers.
 The latter have proliferated in recent decades and affected almost half of OECD imports during the 1980s.
 By the end of 1990, there were more than 200 export-constraint arrangements involving product groups of impor tance to developing countries.
 The incidence of anti-dumping cases against developing countries rose substantially in the late 1980s.
 The more recent effort by the industrial nations to impose 'fair labour standards' on exports from developing countries could well become another form of constraint, unless carefully formulated to focus on the basic rights of workers, rather than on arbitrary minimum wage levels.
 Efforts to accelerate the dismantling of both trade and non-trade barriers should be viewed as a central element of a global strategy to stimulate employment generation.
 6.Debt repayments: The debt problem is a major obstacle to the development and welfare of at least 60 heavily indebted, developing countries, including two-thirds of the world's poorest nations.

"Well, in that case I'm glad I never tried out for the varsity team.
 I'd hate to make things any more difficult for you."
 Brandon gently captured my arm as we slipped inside the school.
 "Speaking of stars, I happened to read them last night and they told me a secret."
 "Oh, really?
 Do tell, I always love to hear a good secret."
 There was a new twinkle in his eye as he shook his head.
 "Oh, it wasn't a secret from you, just one you hadn't shared with me.

I let the statement hang in the air for a couple of seconds, and then finished up with the truth.
 "Of course I don't really know, because it's so big, and parts of it are so boring, that I may never manage to get through the whole thing."
 Chapter 10 The rest of the afternoon finished up on a quiet note.
 After I went back to my table, Rachel worked on some homework for a few more minutes, and then gathered up her things and slipped out.
 I decided the new guy wasn't a football player when he started gathering up his books.
 No athlete in my experience ever took that many books anywhere.
 Not only that, he gently placed them in his backpack like someone who viewed the written word as his friend rather than as a necessary evil that interfered with the hero worship due him from the masses.
 I was so busy watching him that I forgot to look away when he stood up, and he caught me staring.

 Normally I wouldn't have been brave enough to press, but the words were out of my mouth almost before I realized what I was doing.

Shifting attitudes toward marriage and the role of women create greater demand for jobs but also more opportunities for employment, because working women consume more and require additional services.
 Anxiety regarding the impact of technological development on jobs has been aggravated by the belief ‚Äì largely a hangover from the Industrial Age ‚Äì that in the industrial nations automation is rapidly replacing high-wage manufacturing jobs with low-wage jobs in the service sector.
 Actually, services have had a dominant place in Western economies for most of the twentieth century.
 In the United States, they now account for 79 per cent of all jobs, 74 per cent of GDP, and generate a $56 billion trade surplus, compared to a $132 billion deficit for goods.
 Technological developments, such as advances in computers, telecommunications and medical technology, have played at least as great a role in the growth of the service sector as in manufacturing.
 New service jobs in banking, foreign trade, research, design and engineering, computer software, education, health, law, finance, business management, communications, transportation, media and entertainment demand higher levels of education and skills and offer higher pay.
 In 1992 the median manufacturing job in the US paid only $19 per week more than the median job in the service sector.
 The growth of technology is freeing workers from the drudgery of the production line, while providing consumers with a quality of life previously available only to the most wealthy.
 The organization of production is also a major determinant of the number of jobs created.
 The Western pattern of mass production by monolithic corporations that emerged during the first 80 years of this century is no longer the inevitable or even the obvious pattern for either industrial or developing countries in the coming decades.

Did he really hate me so much just because I'd told him off about not protecting Rachel?
 Cassie was waiting for me at my locker when I got there.
 "Brandon wanted me to stop by and let you know he had a few things to take care of, so he won't see you during lunch.
 You can still come sit with us if you want."
 The words were right.
 If I'd been reading them off of a page in a book, I probably would've believed them, but the way she delivered them left no doubt in my mind.
 She didn't want me at their table.
 The only reason she'd stopped by my locker was because Brandon had told her to.
 "Thanks, but I have some studying to do.

After rehab when his head was clear, and he knew how close he came to dying or going to prison, I think he respected what the police were doing.
 By then, several more of his friends had died from an OD or were in rehab or prison.
 We chatted and the officers said that they called Brandon the ‚Äúone percent kid‚Äù due to his progress through recovery.
 They also joked about how I was still the talk of the narcotics and uniform officers as this crazy father who went undercover to save his son‚Äôs ass.
 It was an odd gathering but I know the officers enjoyed it and I know they appreciated that their efforts had a positive result on someone.
 While we had Brandon home for this brief time we also attended a family wedding.
 The four of us, Brandon, Bryce, Lisa and myself, drove together several hours north to a coastal town in northern California.
 We all stayed in the same quaint roadside motel near a popular camping spot called Patrick‚Äôs Point.
 It was woodsy and cool and we shared a two-bedroom unit with a common kitchen and a family room with a fireplace.

Ahhh.
 Those soft, slender hands imitated what she'd felt him do to her, rubbing and caressing.
 He only wished he could get her to do his chest as well so that he could gaze up at her as she ran her hands over him.
 Marie liked touching him.
 He was big and muscular, and she'd thought that just looking at him without his shirt was a great pleasure.
 But that was before she'd gotten to run her hands over him.
 After a few minutes she stopped and lay down with a sigh.
 The beach was beautiful, and the air smelled so good.

When my eyes finally fluttered open, I was surprised to find myself in Alec's arms once again.
 "Are you okay?"
 He tried to set me down, to stand me up on my feet, but I grabbed onto him as tightly as my shaking arms were able.
 "Don't leave me.
 Please don't make me go."
 I didn't realize I was crying until I tried to talk.
 It was embarrassing, but was I too worried about being sent away to care.
 Any amount of ridicule would be worthwhile if it meant being able to stay with Alec.

I wasn't sure what to do."
 "I'm okay, I just need a minute."
 Since I was already on the ground, I really did just want to lie there for a moment, scorpions, dirt and all, but Britney didn't seem to understand that concept.
 Now that my eyes were open and the whole 911 question had been answered, she was determined to get me back on my feet.
 Chapter 8 I was midway through brushing my teeth before I realized I'd had another night filled with nothing but regular dreams.
 I'd walked into two different classes and found out that there were tests I'd forgotten about, been stranded at the side of the road, and been chased through some kind of rain forest, but while some of those dreams had been plenty terrifying, none of them had even a touch of the surreal vividness of the ones I'd had my first few nights in Sanctuary.
 Maybe they were just some kind of psychological defense mechanism popping up in response to all the changes.
 If so, I kind of wished I could be sick still.
 It's a heck of a thing to not want to be healthy, but I'd gone to bed most every night hoping I'd get to experience another one.
 It was depressing to think that I probably had one less thing to look forward to.

But when she could again talk with her mother, there'd be no point.
 Rick would be gone.
 That thought brought tears to her eyes, and she snuggled closer to him, wishing she could have everyone she cared about in the same decade.
 They spent the afternoon watching TV, reading, and napping.
 "I feel so lazy," Marie said, stretching as she yawned.
 "It's nice to have a day like this every now and then, though."
 "Yeah."
 She looked at his arms with concern.
 "How does your sunburn feel?"

 He looked concerned but I'd learned to read his expressions better than I think he realized.
 He was worried, but not just about me.
 He spent a lot of time worrying.

 It was a lot for someone our age to deal with.

I, for one, believe that if our connections to these realms were cut,‚Äù Jordaan made a motion like knife cutting a loaf of bread, ‚Äúthat in a few years there would not be enough magic for us to use.‚Äù ‚ÄúLuckily, I can think of no way for such a thing to happen.
 But a mortal‚Äôs ability to use mana that has spilled into the mortal world is very limited.
 The Immortalists have overcome this limitation by incorporating certain people‚Äôs direct connection to these realms.
 ‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Jordaan continued, ‚Äúif a mortal can add a Celestial‚Äôs ability to directly tap the Celestial power, he becomes far stronger.
 If the magic user can also tap into the Elemental powers, he again becomes far more powerful.
 Of course, the end goal of the Immortalists is to become a god.
 There are limitations; if an Immortalist were to incorporate a celestial ant‚Äôs connection to the Celestial, he would gain in power.

Rachel took it as the former and sat down next to me, pulling her knees up tight against her chest.
 A few seconds later I heard the howl of an after-market exhaust fed by a turbo-charged engine.
 The green Honda that came screaming through the parking lot was hardly recognizable as an Accord.
 It was approaching too quickly, but I couldn't bring myself to care.
 Besides, Rachel seemed unconcerned.
 Rachel helped me up as the car came to a screeching halt, all four tires locking up to slide it around so that the passenger side was facing us.
 The over-tinted windows smoothly slid down to reveal that James was indeed the driver, and he wasn't any happier than he'd been a few seconds earlier.
 I started towards the back seat, only to feel Rachel's surprisingly-firm grasp guide me towards the front seat.
 She got me settled and then slipped in behind me.
 James pulled out of the parking lot with a rush of acceleration that pinned me to my seat.

 Thanks, Sharon.‚Äù She really was a very nice girl, he mused as he made the tea.
 But he hadn‚Äôt given her a thought since Marie had walked into his life.
 Marie looked up when Rick came back into the living room with their tea.

The service sector represents only 25 per cent of the labour force in developing countries compared with more than 67 per cent in the industrial nations.
 Contrary to common conception, services can be a major contributor to job growth even in countries at earlier stages of development.
 This sector is as amenable to stimulation by government policies as agriculture or manufacturing, and it also provides impetus for the growth of other sectors.
 Supportive policies have enabled trade, transport and other services to generate more than 50 per cent of all jobs in Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore.
 Services have produced more than half of all job growth in many other Asian nations, including private day-care centres, nursery schools and computer training institutes, which are multiplying rapidly in many countries, but can be expanded much further.
 India has adopted an innovative, low-cost, self-employment strategy to expand availability of long-distance telecommunications services by setting up small private telephone and fax centres throughout the country.
 Informal private service enterprises in construction, commerce, food catering, repair and transport have vast growth potential.
 Rapid expansion of education, training and public health, especially rural health and education, can also serve as a conscious strategy for employment generation.

Anger swelled inside, and when he looked to Aurelia he felt an enormous desire to attack.
 She was questioning his master, his brother, questioning what it meant to be him.
 When he opened his eyes, Aurelia stood, shocked by the red light wafting like smoke from Harruq‚Äôs eyes.

Although national and international institutions maintain a variety of data bases and models to track the impact of production, trade and prices in agriculture, these models are too limited in scope and detail to construct a working global model of the agricultural sector, which could serve as a valuable tool in projecting the medium- and long-term interactions of changes in food production, consumption, employment, trade, productivity, technology and environmental factors.
 A world food model, which forms the essential basis for evolving a global strategic plan, can help eliminate both food deficits and surpluses.
 6.On-farm training.
 The massive demonstration programmes, conducted in farmers' own fields by countries such as India to propagate the Green Revolution technology, proved that even uneducated, traditional peasant farmers in developing countries will rush to adopt new technology when its application and benefits are clearly demonstrated.
 The slow dissemination of new technologies that still hampers agriculture in these countries is largely due to the ineffectiveness of more traditional types of extension and farmer education conducted on a relatively limited scale by agricultural colleges, technical institutes and research stations.
 This gap in the agricultural education system can be closed by expanding the agricultural training network to the village level.
 The establishment of farm schools in villages, on land temporarily leased from local farmers, can combine the advantages of both formal training and demonstration on farmers' fields, with emphasis on economic viability and ecological sustainability.
 This is a low cost strategy that requires prior training of a large number of village level instructors, but little investment in infra structure.
 The schools can demonstrate the economic benefits of new and improved crops and cultivation practices, engaging local farmers as both students and staff, and covering most of the cost of training in the form of sale proceeds from the farm schools' production.

 When Rodregas awoke he was confused about why he was lying on the floor.
 As he opened his eyes he was also alarmed to see Captain Poir looking down at him with a confused and worried expression.

Crime is on the rise.
 Ominous signs have appeared that the authoritarian past is not yet fully buried and could once again arise, if the forward momentum of the transition process does not quickly improve the lives of people within the region.
 The whole world has an immense stake in the successful outcome of the transition in Eastern Europe.
 Initial Results of Reform
 The pre-existent conditions, the starting point of the transition, the timing, speed and extent of the reforms introduced during the past five years varied considerably among the 25 nations of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
 But, with few exceptions, they were founded on the same general principles and on the policy recommendations of Western proponents of rapid transformation to total free-market liberal capitalism, based on a simultaneous shock strategy encompassing macro-economic stabilization, prices and property rights.
 Western governments and the international financial institutions, led by the IMF, strongly advocated this approach and linked financial assistance to its adoption.
 The strategy called for rapid deregulation of prices, privatization of farms and industry, introduction of a convertible currency, and balancing the budget to reduce the high fiscal deficits, primarily by reducing military expenditure and subsidies to producers and consumers.
 The assumption was that a programme with these elements would result in a significant increase in production, efficiency and the availability of consumer goods within a short time.
 The actual results were quite contrary to the expectations of these countries‚Äô Western economic advisers, as well as to the governments and people of the region.

 Emily ran forward and pointed to Seth who was clawing toward his weapon.
 ‚ÄúDo something!‚Äù she screamed.
 Before I could reply, fire shot from her finger.

 Cultural Values and Development
 The growing violence, more and more visible disparities between rich and poor, and large-scale destruction of the environment cited in this report have raised widespread concern that the present course of development is undermining the cultural as well as the natural environment for human development.
 A careful analysis of the relationship between culture and development reveals that cultural values are the essential foundation for all lasting social achievement.
 The security, stability, productivity, growth and sustainability of society are determined by its values.

It was amazing to think the near-chaos currently drifting up from the pit would transform itself into the glorious strains of the Overture in just a few minutes.
 I was so intent on the program it should've taken a small explosion to bring my head around, but something caused me to look up as Alec walked past the drapes.
 He looked even more gorgeous than normal.
 I'd gone back and forth, both with myself, and with Rachel, on how much to dress up.
 Going in normal street clothes would've cheapened the experience, but I hadn't wanted to stick out too much from the rest of the kids, all of whom I'd been pretty sure would be in shorts and polos.
 I'd been right, which had made me glad I'd compromised and come in my one and only sun dress.
 Alec apparently hadn't gotten the memo.
 He was in an honest-to-goodness full tux.
 I wasn't the only one stunned by how good he looked; there was a ripple of turned heads as people noticed his entrance.
 He paced the short distance down to the back row of seats with such incredible grace that I felt my mouth go dry.

 I had thought he had shown up because I‚Äôd impressed upon him to follow before I blacked out, but I had already been bound again at that point.

It is good not to hunger for magic and be FREE!‚Äù Rodregas was, of course, curious about the Hellborn‚Äôs background but had been hesitant to ask.
 You do not want to piss off one of the Hellborn.
 Hellborn were not necessarily chaotic and sadistic beings, like actual daemons or Greater Daemons, at least unless they voluntarily chose to become one of Hell‚Äôs Chosen.
 Rodregas did not think even one of the Immortalists would choose to mess with one of Hell‚Äôs Chosen.
 Hellborn on the mortal world were welcome among the Orqui much like those of Celestial blood were among the humans and the AElves.
 The Orqui mated with Daemons and their offspring became its races noble house, just as the blood of Celestials flowed in the noble houses of Humans and AElves.
 Of course, here in the Eastern Realms true ruler ship was not by the demi-gods of the noble houses anymore but by the Immortalists and their Guild of the Celestial Path.
 Often those of Celestial blood, instead of being rulers, were prey to the Guild for their rituals.
 Rodregas decided it was now or never if he was going to ask Doi‚Äôvan of his past.

Then they started to pick up speed and I covered my face with my hands.
 The rain streaked through my hair, soaking it to my head.
 Seth looked extremely annoyed as he stood there, his blue hair plastered to his face.
 His eyes were half covered by his hair and his eyes locked onto mine.
 He rolled his eyes and looked away.
 Jason had his arms over his head, trying to keep the rain off his red hair but I already saw dark spots all over it where the rain had escaped his arms.
 Emily's pink hair was dry and safely under a hood.
 Wait, what?

The venom in such a massive dose poisoned him, so the story goes.
 I do believe in Karma (well, I do now!)
 and the world is a better place without this man, but I don‚Äôt know if I believe that story.
 However he died though, this man was in pain, and somehow that feels like vindication for my years of suffering at his hands.

 I also felt bad for his aging Father (my Greek grandpa) who was very ill, as this was his only son and his namesake.

It is, therefore, important that the concept of higher productivity per unit of land, water, time, energy, labour and capital be extended to all farming systems and all regions.
 Most developing countries will have no option but to produce more food and agricultural commodities from less land and water in the twenty-first century.
 The challenge lies in accomplishing this in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner.
 The FAO should launch a co ordinated international effort to extend the principles and strategies of the Green Revolution to eradicate global food shortages within a decade.
 The Green Revolution was originally applied to improving productivity of wheat and rice in high potential areas.
 After the first rounds of phenomenal success, the effort to extend it to other agricultural regions and other crops lost momentum, because the urgent necessity had been eliminated.
 Recognizing the importance of agricultural surplus to rural employment, industrialization and exports, renewed efforts are called for to apply the comprehensive, integrated approach of the Green Revolution to high potential commercial crops and to all regions.
 With the knowledge gained over the past 30 years, greater emphasis can be placed on ensuring that the productivity improvements are not only economically viable but also ecologically sustainable.
 Region-specific strategies should be adopted for mountain areas, high rainfall tropics, uplands and irrigated plains.
 The crops covered should include foodgrains and oil seeds, cotton and jute, sugar cane, fruit, vegetables, dairy, meat, medicinal plants, spices, and agro-forestry for fodder, fuel and industrial raw materials.

Then they clicked and she shoved it in her pocket.
 ‚ÄúYup I can.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always one step ahead.‚Äù ‚ÄúAlways.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo what do you think we should do?‚Äù Emily asked from my bed later on.
 I swallowed the bit of strawberry that had been in my mouth.

My body felt hot and cold simultaneously as I returned.
 I reopened my eyes and stood up, stretched, and grabbed my bag.
 My back sent a chorus of cracks cascading upwards as I straightened myself.
 I raised the side of my shirt to find the thin, red scratch marks.
 Any injuries I get in my hunter form I have when I become human again, just not as severe.
 I quickly ran my fingers over the darker, thicker marks on my shin, the skin sore and purple.
 I quickly checked myself for any other injures I might have acquired from my tangle with the Thrasher, but all I found was a bunch of bruises.
 Seth seemed to have disappeared, so I trudged down the road to my house.

"No, I find that I'm strangely unconcerned right now with what the future may bring, and this seems entirely too good an opportunity to waste on a substitute that knows even less about physics than we do."
 I returned his smile, and grabbed his hand, tugging him in the direction of the outside door.
 We didn't go far, stopping in a little cluster of trees no more than fifty feet from the school.
 "So is this nearly complete disregard for consequences typical?"
 Alec gazed at me with one of his indecipherable looks for several seconds.
 Feeling more than a little self-conscious, I tried to let go of his hand and scoot a little further away, but he maintained his grasp.
 "Please don't.

He had the feeling they both knew to be careful with a fragile mortal, and they thought it was funny that he was so worried.
 This scene repeated itself almost every night, and several times the cats also brought game they had killed into the farmyard.
 Rodregas made a point of always taking a piece of the kill, as for some reason he felt this was expected as part of their adopted group.
 Plus, it added fresh meat to their diet without the three having to go hunting.
 After awhile he started to take the presence of the Dire Cats for granted and stopped worrying about the danger.
 Several weeks later, came the first night where neither the cats nor Doi‚Äôvan were in the room.
 Doi‚Äôvan was out messing with the well, Imeralda was reading one of the magic Grimoires by the fireplace.
 Rodregas was supposed to be reading as well, but had lost his focus on the complex diagram and was just looking at Imeralda.
 She was so beautiful, slim yet curvy.

Its calls for a standing world army, for the recognition of full employment as a fundamental right and for the elimination of protectionist trade policies to mention but a few examples will cause some sharp intakes of breath among world leaders.
 Indeed, the report contains many ideas that merit and should stimulate further reflection.
 The situation of the countries in transition in Eastern Europe, high lighted in this report, illustrates perfectly the need for an integrated approach to development considered as a total human process.
 The Commission's report contains specific proposals in this regard as well as an overview pointing to existing domestic assets of various kinds which could help the countries concerned.
 It addresses the topic of job creation with innovative ideas on the roles of technology and trade, and emphasizes the significance of the developing countries and agricul ture in the world economy.
 Its global education programme proposal placing appropriate emphasis on the key issue of girls' and women's education is one that particularly commends itself to UNESCO, which is already actively engaged in efforts along similar lines in conjunction with its UN partners.
 This timely report should help to promote the idea of human-centred development within a culture of peace as a way forward to a better world.
 We are gratified that ICPF should have assigned UNESCO, as the intellectual arm of the United Nations, a prominent role in its recommended agenda for action, and we reaffirm our commit ment to working with all possible partners in pursuit of the goal of global peace and sustainable human development.

Qurrah chuckled though it felt like hammers pummeled his chest.
 He spread his hands to either side and bathed a few houses with fire.
 The city‚Äôs fear was deep enough he could sense it like a cold breeze, and he wanted it to deepen.
 An arrow whistled by, clipping his ear.
 Qurrah dropped to his knees as a second thudded into the side of a home, inches from his neck.
 A spell on his lips, he spun, grabbing chunks of dirt in his hands to use as components for a spell.
 From two windows, a pair of elves held bows, and together they pulled back the strings and released their arrows.
 The ground beneath Qurrah cracked and tore as his spell completed, so that he fell into a deep pit.
 The landing jarred his back, and he gasped for air, but for the moment he was safe from the arrows that went flying above.
 The fire continued to spread.

Davis had never rearranged his schedule for her.
 Rick spent every moment of every evening with her.

 Marie blinked back tears of confusion.
 She was betrothed to Davis.
 But it was getting harder and harder to remember why she'd fallen in love with him.
 He didn't spend much time with her, didn't hold her very often, didn't do anything really fun.
 And he wasn't nearly as handsome as Rick.
 Rick had beautiful blue eyes and-and a broad, muscular chest that she got to see every morning if she woke up before he did.

You can't even go hiking anymore..." I'd already realized Britney wasn't the type to think twice before words actually left her mouth.
 Curious.
 "What do you mean we can't go hiking?"
 She was looking around at the other students.
 "Nothing, come on.
 We're going to be late for class."
 I followed without a word, even more intrigued now.
 'Cool' people don't sweat tardiness and Britney really wanted to be cool.
 A slender, frumpy-looking woman looked up from her desk as Britney and I walked in.
 I held up my form, which she took without reading it.

His eyes flipped between the half-orcs and their master.

 He removed his bow and ran across the grass.
 Velixar had not moved since the brothers‚Äô departure, his hands resting on the grass, palms upward.
 His hood fell far past his eyes, blocking nearly all of his face.
 Yet even with lack of sight and sound from Dieredon‚Äôs approach, the man knew someone neared.

Biology?
 Character?
 It‚Äôs inexplicable, really.
 All of my roommates had dropped out of high school but somehow I continued; although my grades sucked, they were passing grades.
 In my senior year I only took classes until noon because that is all I needed to graduate.
 I got another job at a local restaurant for the lunch shift as well as any days I was off from the grocery store.
 I realized at an early age that nobody was going to give me anything and if I wanted something I would need to earn it.
 If I didn‚Äôt succeed, I wouldn‚Äôt survive!
 Somewhere around this time, I decided to try and find my biological father, Richard, a natural thing for a young man my age to want to do, right?
 So I tracked him down and called him.

The human men would be of least interest to the Guild and the easiest to blend in.
 On the other hand, while the Hellborn were feared and disliked, the Immortalists should not be interested in Doi‚Äôvan.
 He was also clearly a gifted warrior and between the two of them they would make a dangerous duo.
 However, the Hellborn were feared because of their daemonic natures; they had hungers and urges and famously bad tempers.
 Doi‚Äôvan could be just as much of a danger as help.
 Rodregas had to admit though, that in the little time he had dealt with him, he kind of liked the big guy.
 It looked like Audrian was going to argue, but Rodregas just cut him off and stated, ‚ÄúVery well, you two may travel with me, but let‚Äôs get on the road.
 Audrian, make sure you and the other two do not forget your oaths.
 I will expect no one to know that we head for the Northern Coast.‚Äù Audrian looked like he was going to say something.

 He was thrilled when she didn't say she'd probably be back in 1927 before then.
 She was quiet during the ride home, remembering the scene she'd done.
 And how she'd peered through a camera.
 And sat in a director's chair as he walked his sitcom actors through a scene.
 It hadn't been a page out of a fairy tale like she'd expected, but it had been exciting nevertheless.

Furthermore, as recent events have demonstrated, nations contributing their forces will have a strong propensity to resist their active deployment in situations that involve significant risks.
 Even after the Security Council decided to send a peace-keeping force into Rwanda for strictly humanitarian purposes, none of the leading military powers, with the exception of France, were willing to contribute the modest amount of military equipment urgently needed to protect UN troops.
 Similar efforts are in various stages of maturity for establishing standing international forces at the regional level in Western Europe, Latin America and other places as part of collective security arrangements.
 The limitation of these proposals, like that of NATO and the erstwhile Warsaw Pact, is that they are fundamentally exclusive in nature and could easily become competitive with other forces as the East and West blocs have in the past.
 The strong resentment voiced by Russia at the proposal that some Eastern European nations would join NATO illustrates the danger of expanding exclusive military clubs.
 For NATO to overcome these legitimate concerns, it would have to be thrown open to all nations that seek to join and abide by its charter.
 The great reluctance of the West to shoulder the burden of responsibility for security enforcement in Eastern Europe under a widened NATO umbrella highlights the basic inadequacy of exclusive blocs for meeting global security needs.
 If the structural limitations of the UN cannot be immediately overcome, the alternative would be to build a cooperative security mechanism in parallel with the UN but structured along more democratic lines similar to NATO.
 A World Army could consist of an international peace force that would unconditionally guarantee the security of its members against external aggression based on the following provisions:
 Membership in the World Army would be voluntary and open to all countries, provided that they have and maintain democratic, multi-party political systems.

After all, I adored Eric Curtis.
 A Trip
 I drive a lot, across the desert to visit my kids and grandson in Tucson, and all over the West and sometimes farther on vacations and book promotion tours.
 One reason I drive rather than fly is, I come closest to adoring God while on the road.
 Between cities, I plug in my I-pod.
 What goes in comes out.
 If I listen to a love song, these days I‚Äôll probably wish for a loving companion.
 If I turn on a radio talk show, I usually want to argue.

 It seemed like a crime to defile such a pretty dress, and I wanted to remember it like it had looked on the hanger, all shimmery and wispy.

The decision on whether to permit the continued existence of nuclear weapons is of too great importance to the future of humanity to be left to the discretion of one or a few member nations of the international community.
 Under the present structure of the UN, the only body with authority to act is the Security Council, but the veto power of the five permanent members deprives other nations of an effective voice.
 The proposal to ban completely the possession and use of nuclear weapons should be put before the Council.
 The right of veto should be rescinded with respect to this most crucial issue.
 A time-bound plan should be drawn up by the UN for complete and total nuclear disarmament by all nations.
 Ban on ballistic missiles
 Nuclear devices are the most lethal class of weapons, but much of their threat arises from the development of ballistic missile technology which can deliver them to distant targets unmanned and without risk to the aggressor.
 Even if nuclear weapons are eliminated, these vehicles can be utilized to carry large conventional payloads that strike terror in a distant population.
 The danger to all nations of unexpected and unprovoked attack from near or distant powers can be vastly reduced by declaring an immediate ban on the use of ballistic missiles of all types, including those carrying conventional warheads.
 This proposal, first put forth by US President Reagan in 1986, would eliminate the discriminatory provisions that deny missile acquisition to some, while preserving the right of others to maintain and develop this purely offensive capability.

 Valentine's Day was usually filled with enough examples of guys screwing up to make me feel okay.

The challenge is to develop simultaneously both individual and social capacities and utilize their potentials in a complementary manner.
 For the individual, development involves acquisition of greater know ledge, more progressive attitudes, improved skills and higher values.
 For the collective, development involves establishment of more useful and productive institutions, systems, organizations and cultural values.
 The conventional view that development is essentially a function of scarce economic inputs must give way to the perception that the opportunities and potentials for rapid development far exceed actual achievements in every country.
 Looking back over the past few decades, we realize that the speed of social progress could certainly have been much greater than it was.
 The tremendous potential for accelerating development is most easily illustrated by in stances in which actual achievements substantially excelled expectations, such as the enormous leap in world agriculture during the 1960s and 1970s and the phenomenal growth of incomes, employment and exports in East Asia during the last ten years.
 These unforeseen accomplishments reflect the magnitude of potentials that these countries possessed but had not previously utilized.
 The untapped resources of the society can be categorized under several headings:
 Knowledge of the process of development and the factors that stimulate it.
 Education that imparts progressive social values and practically useful perspectives.

That muddy fog was gone now and under my black lashes waited deep emerald jewels, flecked with the darkest of browns.
 Chevelle had been right, this did suit me.
 The image in the mirror was stunning.
 It felt odd to marvel over my own reflection, but I couldn‚Äôt pretend I didn‚Äôt like it.
 The changes were still unnerving though, and I tried to remember what I looked like in my oldest memories, to see before, to see my mother‚Äôs face.
 The door opened behind me.
 ‚ÄúAh, yes,‚Äù Ruby purred as she looked me over.
 ‚ÄúLovely.‚Äù Her inflection left no doubt the word was not a compliment, only that she found it lovely she‚Äôd discovered me here.
 I could see Chevelle through the open door behind her, still in the main room and evidently annoyed.

 And when I did let him kiss me, he said he'd rather die than ever hurt me."
 Mrs. Tranton reached out to play with a lock of her daughter's hair.

Seth drew his sword and crouched down.
 He shuffled forward and motioned for us to follow.
 We slid through the trees as quietly as we could.
 I kept my eye on the faery men, waiting for one of them to turn around and notice us hiding in the trees.
 I ducked behind a tree and looked over just in time to see Emily trip and fall out of her bush.
 The faery and dwarves looked at her in surprise.
 I guess they‚Äôve never seen a teenage half-ling girl fall out of a bush before.
 ‚ÄúAm I interrupting something?‚Äù Emily asked with a gulp.
 The faery men drew their double swords and charged at her.

"I'm not mad."
 "Good."
 He drew her into his arms, bending to kiss her.
 Her mouth tasted so good, felt so warm and soft.
 He'd give anything to keep her here with him, to marry her and make love to her and spend the rest of his life with her.
 Remembering that she‚Äôd said she liked being kissed on the neck, he moved to press his lips to her neck, kissing, nibbling, sucking.
 Marie gasped, threading her fingers into his hair.
 His hands slid down her back, pulling her hard against him, reminding her of how he'd pinned her against his car last night.
 Moaning at the pleasure of the contact, she wrapped her arms around him, wanting to get even closer to him.
 Rick covered her mouth with his again, his kiss so hot and thorough and demanding that it elicited more moans from her.

Moaning at the pleasure of the contact, she wrapped her arms around him, wanting to get even closer to him.
 Rick covered her mouth with his again, his kiss so hot and thorough and demanding that it elicited more moans from her.
 He ended the embrace with a series of quick, hard kisses and then eased his hold on her, panting.
 Marie started to reach for him again, but then her eyes narrowed.
 Pushing against his chest so hard that he stumbled back, she whirled and stormed off into the fog.
 How dare he!
 How dare he use his kisses to try to keep her from going home!
 It was already hard enough just to look at him in the morning before she walked in the garden.
 He knew that whenever they kissed, she didn't want to stop, that she'd kiss him forever.
 Just last night he'd told her that they couldn't kiss like that unless they got married.

He would have liked to have known her.

 Rick went to bed without having decided anything about an outfit for the dance.
 But for some reason, the young woman from the 1920s was still very much on his mind.

 All she wanted to know was why they couldn't at least have dinner together tonight.

 They dug a large hole in a corner and then bled the body dry, letting the fluids soak into the dirt.
 Occasionally, they would halt and listen, worried their violent struggle had reached unwanted ears.
 No curious investigators arrived, however, and they continued with their dark deed.
 When the blood dripping from the elf‚Äôs wounds became but a trickle, they filled the hole and moved on.
 Using the clothes and robes from upstairs, the two brothers wiped away as much of Ahrqur‚Äôs blood as they could.
 They tossed the bloody clothes, the table, and the pieces of glass they into the fireplace and burned them.
 Harruq wrapped the body in spare blankets he found in a closet.

It wasn't until she released Alec from a hug, and slowly moved back into the cabin, that I realized it was how she moved that made her seem so old.
 Her motions reminded me of how my grandfather had moved the last few years before he'd died.
 Slowly, and with extra care, as if a careless action would leave him crumpled on the floor, racked with pain.
 "Mallory, I'd like to introduce you to Adriana Paige.
 Adriana, Mallory."
 I smiled, and gingerly offered my hand to her, which she clasped in both of hers.
 "I'm very happy to finally get to meet you, young lady.
 Alec is better company than most, but it's nice to have a new face around here."
 I felt myself warming to her immediately, even more so as she ushered us into her small sitting room and clucked over me, all the while proclaiming that I was far too skinny.
 It was exactly the kind of thing you'd expect your grandma to say, but I almost believed her.

In the subtle shadings we girls used to measure commitment, it wasn't as good as if he'd come right out and said, 'I love you Adriana Paige', but it was still pretty good, and it was a complete first for me.
 Once I made it past the second part of his statement, I was able to start considering the first part of what he'd said.
 It was horrifying and amazing all at once, and it made complete sense.
 His mom was living in memories because the real world was just a pale shadow of her life with his father.
 Alec seemed to take my silence as condemnation, or possibly just agreement with his self-condemnation.
 "We're where the legends of succubi originated.
 Irresistible demons who drain their victims dry, who leave their lovers a hollow shell of what they were before."
 I'd finally worked through things enough inside my mind, to respond, but he bulldozed right over me.

 Qurrah stood erect, his hands touching the sturdy oak.
 Words of magic slipped from his lips.
 The shadows that weaved about the door suddenly gained life, crawling and gliding until impenetrable darkness covered every bit of oak.
 ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd that do?‚Äù Harruq asked.
 His deep voice seemed like thunder in the quiet, although he did his best to speak softly.
 ‚ÄúFollow me,‚Äù Qurrah whispered.
 ‚ÄúYou will see.‚Äù
 He took a step forward and vanished into the shadows.
 Harruq glanced around, swallowed, took two quick breaths, and then hopped into the door with his eyes squeezed shut.

Maybe the masters like Michelangelo and da Vinci had completed their greatest works with expressions very similar to what everyone else in the class was sporting.
 Still, I couldn't help envy such contentment.
 I dropped off my bundle of papers at Mrs. North's class, and started back towards my locker.
 I couldn't help trying to catch another glimpse of the art class as I walked past.
 I'd been hoping to see Alec again, but hadn't expected him to look up as I craned my neck to see inside.
 I stumbled a little in surprise.
 He was still gorgeous, but the simple joy was gone.
 He no longer looked like something that couldn't exist in this world, but even with anger etched on his features my heart still skipped a beat.
 I ducked around the corner and started down the stairs, my embarrassment at being caught staring giving way to anger.

In his heart, he knew he could never again strike at Aurelia, regardless of what anyone else wanted of him.
 The look on her face when he had stabbed her, that combination of sadness and shock, would haunt him forever.
 ‚ÄúFine,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúI promise.
 Happy?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúFar from it.‚Äù
 Aurelia crossed her legs, tossed back her hair, and then leaned her head on her hands as she stared into the fire.
 ‚ÄúI want you to listen to me, alright Harruq?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù
 He glanced down, uncomfortable and saddened that Aurelia refused to look him in the eye.

I sat for hours exploring the early texts, stories of the river clans and their battles with the Imps of Long Forgotten, firsthand accounts of the Trials of Istanna, and the long lineages of the eldest families.
 A whisper roused me from my studies and I realized it was late, so I decided to give up and start again the next day.
 Rising unsteadily, I heard the whisper again.
 But it wasn‚Äôt a whisper‚Äîit was the wind.
 I glanced backward.
 Paper fell to scatter on the floor.
 I surveyed the library, but it was practically empty.
 Someone on a higher level must have knocked the pages down.
 I bent over and read the closest document.

For the least developed countries, these gains could be double the amount of official development assistance.
 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cited reasons for concluding that actual gains may be significantly higher than these estimates.
 New engines for global economy: Economic growth in the developing world is projected to remain strong throughout the decade, averaging 4 to 5 per cent per year in low- and middle-income countries.
 At a time of slackened demand and low levels of growth in most industrial nations, developing countries have become the principal engine driving expansion of the global economy and employment generation, whereas until recently the Third World was perceived primarily as a drag on the world economy or a threat to jobs in the West.
 The potential for much higher rates of growth in these countries, as recently achieved by China, can result in much larger flows of capital, technology and organizational know-how.
 Recognition of this opportunity should be central to the strategy of industrial nations for stimulating their own job growth.
 Advancing technology: The pace of technological development continues to accelerate.
 The application of biotechnology in agriculture offers significant opportunities to raise productivity and generate higher incomes for farmers.
 Medical biotechnology is opening up the prospect of longer, healthier lives of better quality for the elderly.
 Over the next 40 years, child mortality is expected to fall to half its present level and life expectancy is projected to rise by 10 per cent.

Society has no alternative but to meet these growing expectations by channelling the awakened energies into productive pursuits.
 For that we need to acquire a greater understanding of the social and psychological process that has already enabled so many to achieve so much.
 The challenge and the opportunity now presented is to make conscious the previously unconscious process of development, to accelerate it, and to convert the revolution of rising social expectations into a positive energizing movement of the entire global society.
 This is the all-powerful driving force that has so radically transformed the social landscape during this ‚Äòcentury of the common man‚Äô.
 This is the ultimate ‚Äòrationale‚Äô behind the inevitable claim of the poor everywhere that will be made with ever-growing insistence and impatience until it is finally granted ‚Äì as the birthright of every human being ‚Äì freedom, food, education, employment, prosperity and fulfilment for all.
 Perspectives for the New Millennium
 The individual effect, complex linkages, mutually supportive interactions and consequent cumulative impact of these two revolutions and the nine other factors propelling global change are incalculable.
 They make this a rare moment in history for a quantum leap forward, which many have dreamed about but few believed achievable.
 Seizing this opportunity requires, most importantly of all, a change in awareness, attitude and perspective.
 Several ideas will be of abiding value in our endeavour to make the most of this rare moment.

It is of crucial importance not only to the poor, but also to the peace and stability of global society that we complete the task of banishing famine and hunger once and for all.
 Hunger anywhere threatens peace everywhere.
 Hunger leads to political instability, social unrest, massive migrations, rebellions, civil war, crime and violence.
 Prosperity, which eliminates hunger, also tends to eliminate violence.
 Even in war-ravaged Africa, experience shows that where food is plentiful, war is avoided.
 The converse is also true.
 Historically, war and civil strife have been the single greatest cause of famines.
 In addition to destroying crops and food supplies, it disrupts food distribution through the use of sieges and blockades.
 In the past decade, war has had a greater impact on food supplies in Africa, particularly the Sahelian region, than have the severe droughts that periodically plague the continent.
 Freedom from hunger and political freedom go hand in hand.

 Ruby‚Äôs red curls gave her away.
 She had tossed back the hood of her cloak and was laughing with a large elf.
 Steed, I was almost sure because of his stance.
 I scanned the darkness and found two other figures.
 One was about the size of Steed; the other was thinner and appeared fidgety, even in the darkness.
 They approached Ruby and Steed and out of the shadows I could see their dark hair.
 The thinner one‚Äôs hair was long, his bangs falling over sharp features.

The real suffering for not eating wouldn't come into play until we hit the tutoring lab.
 Oh well, when I got home ravenous and ate a decent-sized meal Mom would probably be ecstatic.
 Or too wrapped up in some project to even notice.
 It was hard enough anticipating what I was going to do from day to day.
 Trying to figure Mom out was truly futile.
 Being held up by Mrs. Campbell at least had one advantage; the line for Britney to get food was nearly non-existent.

He tightened his grip about them, whispering a few words of magic as he did.
 Then he looked to the window.
 He could barely see a bow and part of a hand.

 The Neldaren warriors charged, hoping to overwhelm their opponents before arrows took them all.
 The elf in the window leaned out to unleash a killing strike, but it was Qurrah who did the killing.
 Four pieces of bone leapt from his hand.

They were so careful not to cross paths, it was possible this was a true first, but seeing them now there was no way to get around the fact that Brandon was at least two inches taller, as well as being broader and more muscular.
 I'd seen Alec shirtless, and he had the incredible physique of a swimsuit model, but Brandon's was that of a professional body builder.
 Either of them dwarfed me, but Brandon gave off an air of menace that even Alec's controlled power couldn't offset.
 Brandon's next few words came out in a low growl that I couldn't make out, and then he slowly backed away from Alec before he and the rest of his pack disappeared from sight.
 I finished processing everything about the time Alec turned and walked back.
 I opened my mouth to protest, but he shook his head at me as we all fell into formation around him.
 From what little I knew about Alec's pack, it wasn't uncommon for them to spend time together without the kind of chest-beating byplay that was so much a part of Brandon's group, but our lunch table was even more subdued than I'd expected.
 Faced with an almost complete lack of conversation, I didn't have the courage to ask some of the questions on my mind.
 It wasn't until I'd followed Isaac to my history class that I finally worked up the nerve to find out more of what was going on.

There was a rustle from the brush several yards in the opposite direction I was hiding.
 He rushed toward it and I followed, unsure why he was running.
 The noise was made by a small boar and the human was chasing it.
 He ran after it, gasping for air, and I followed close behind, thrilling at the spectacle.
 The boar approached a ridge of rock and turned, giving the human the advantage.
 He leaped after it, blade held wide, and landed, slicing into its side and twisting the blade back out.
 He was leaning over its small motionless body, heaving for breath, covered in blood.
 I laughed, shocked at myself, but filled with excitement and amusement.
 He stood, whirling to face me, bloody blade held out.
 I had to stifle another laugh.

 It didn't tell the date of her death.
 That was odd--he was sure it had been in this section.
 His heart began racing as he scanned those pages.
 There was no mention at all of her death--or of her marriage.
 The only information was her date of birth, the names of her parents and brother, and the general family history.
 He knew that the other information had been there before, and after his mind had completely rejected the impossible--that the print had changed when Marie had stepped from 1927 into 2011 (another impossibility)--he rapidly considered the implications of such an impossibility.
 Maybe the information about the rest of her life wouldn't appear until she returned.

Now!‚Äù Brandon stood up to leave, but Harry stood up from his dining room chair and went towards him and so did Lisa.
 They asked Brandon to sit back down on the overstuffed chair and he did.
 ‚ÄúHe won‚Äôt find anything in there,‚Äù Brandon mumbled.
 A few minutes later, Bryce rounded the corner into the room with his arms outstretched cupping the Oxy and foil he found inside CD cases.
 I had never even thought to check there.
 Brandon stood up.
 Bryce glared into Brandon‚Äôs eyes, and in the room‚Äôs dead silence Bryce laid the drugs and the burned black-sketched foil on the counter like it was a dead animal.
 I stood in front of Brandon, looking slightly up at him, as he is taller than me.
 The room was silent and everyone awestruck.
 After what we just went through with him‚Ä¶ I looked Brandon in his guilty darkened eyes and I said, ‚ÄúPrepare yourself to find out what will happen to you every time you lie to me‚Ä¶ are you ready?‚Äù Before he could reply or even contemplate my words, I felt the crack of Brandon‚Äôs nose on my knuckles and he flew backwards off his feet.

A blue portal ripped through the air before Qurrah, beckoning him.

 He felt the sensation of traveling a great distance yet his mind insisted he had taken only a single step.
 He could see the orange glow of the great pyre several miles away.

I made it another couple steps, just far enough to grab Britney as I started to fall.
 I had a split second to be grateful I'd lost all of that weight so Britney wouldn't collapse under me, and then the darkness claimed me.
 Even though I knew I wouldn't remember the void when I finally came to, I wanted nothing more than to just float in the darkness.
 It had been a hard day.
 I'd....actually I wasn't sure why it'd been a hard day, but something told me I'd unconsciously been at the end of my rope just before I'd collapsed.
 Unfortunately that same thing told me I couldn't dwell here in the comforting absence, there was a very important reason for me to regain my feet.
 The void was reluctant to let me go, stripping me of memories and experiences as I fought my way free.
 By the time I was near surfacing I no longer remembered just how much I'd wanted to stay.

 The sub had finally pushed his way through the crowd, and looked like he was about two steps away from a total panic.
 Alec stood, and it wasn't until I went up at the same time that I realized he was carrying me.
 "I think she'll be fine, but maybe I should get her to the nurse.
 Just to be sure."
 Even as he was talking, Alec was moving towards the door.

I'd never heard her be quite so cynical.
 It was completely at odds with the innocent, accepting exterior she usually displayed.
 My surprise must have leaked through.
 Almost as soon the thought crossed my mind Rachel's demeanor crossed back from the older, jaded visage, to one that was more youthful, even embarrassed.
 "Sorry, I know she's your friend.
 I shouldn't say things like that, but that's really what she's doing.
 By the time the actual dance arrives, everyone who is anyone will have a date, most of them picked out by the girl weeks before the boy even started thinking about the dance."
 There wasn't really any bitterness in her voice, but there was something, maybe the same kind of longing I felt when I talked about Prom.
 "You're probably right.
 That would fit with what I know of Britney so far."

Why would a book, no matter what its contents, have such a feel to it?
 He walked back to the book and got down on the ground.
 Without actually touching it, Rodregas slowly ran his fingertips along the binder of the book.
 While the feeling was not as strong as when he had held it, clearly the feeling of what could only be described as evil emanated from the book.
 Was this feeling truly coming from the book or was this some new ability of his new body to sense the nature of the book‚Äôs contents?
 Rodregas got up and walked over to the bookshelf.
 He closed his eyes and, trying not to touch, lightly ran his hands close to the row of books.
 Quickly he realized that with some books he felt nothing.
 Other books seemed to buzz with energy but gave off no bad feelings.
 Still others had a bad odor of decay or foulness that made him want to cover his nose and pull away.

 If properly administered, these programme have proved successful in reducing costs, imparting new skills and identifying false welfare claims.
 Redirect welfare expenses for creating jobs, rather than encouraging idleness, by paying welfare recipients to carry out public service activities in return for welfare payments.
 This requires the identification of employment-intensive programmes that provide clear benefit to the community without interfering with existing business, such as the US Civilian Conservation Corps that built the US National Parks system in the 1930s.
 Expanding or upgrading the educational system would be a priority area.
 16.Make income distribution more equitable: The number of jobs available is directly related to patterns of income distribution.
 In Japan and other dynamic Asian economies, the ratio between the bottom and top pay is as much as 5 or 10 times lower than in the United States.
 A highly skewed income distribution results in lower levels of overall demand, growth and job creation.
 Lopsided income distribution fuels speculative investment, more and more of which goes overseas.
 The average wages for production workers in the United States are the lowest they have been since 1967, with 18 per cent of full-time workers not earning enough to keep a family of four out of poverty, up from 12 per cent in 1979.

A similar impact occurs at the point of concentrated consumption, especially in the inner cities of America, where crime and murder rates have soared due to drug-related violence.
 Inevitably, drug trafficking is linked with illicit arms, terrorist groups and the Mafia.
 Criminal elements are increasingly gaining control over the administrative and political structures of drug-producing states, where drug-related corruption permeates the military and government.
 Neither the proliferation of small arms, nor the proliferation of drugs, nor the growth of terrorist and criminal activity can be solved as isolated problems, or by the independent initiatives of individual states.
 No country is exempt from the danger, which will continue to multiply unless checked and eradicated by concerted international action.
 Urgent steps are needed to classify and register small arms production and trade, to monitor and control their manufacture and limit their export.
 Agreements are needed to reduce production and severely restrict sales.
 Strong sanctions must be instituted to discourage states from actively or passively aiding or abetting small arms proliferation.
 The scope of the UN Conventional Arms Register should be expanded to cover small arms, but at the same time its provisions must be greatly strengthened in order to make this an effective mechanism.
 Reporting must be made mandatory rather than voluntary, and an independent surveillance system should be established to monitor compliance.

At the time, it seemed like, ‚ÄúWow, my dad is cool,‚Äù but I later realized how sick it all truly was.
 The fact is, this man was never a father or a dad or anything to me.
 Richard basically knocked my mother up in high school, married her, had another son and abandoned her and his sons while they were still babies.
 He never paid my mother a dime in child support.
 My mother tried to warn me when I decided I wanted to meet him, but as only time would tell, trying to tell your teenage son anything is a virtual impossibility.
 After I graduated high school, I went to Hawaii with a friend to live.
 The simple reason?
 I was eighteen and that was drinking age in Hawaii.
 I quit my grocery job and took the money I had saved and headed off to the islands.

Ignorance and scepticism about new opportunities are characteristic of development at each stage and in every field of activity.
 Information about success stories helps overcome this resistance and spurs people to action.
 Enormous potentials are waiting to catch the attention of the society and take off at this moment.
 Proven technology exists in many fields that await application because people do not know or do not believe that it can be employed successfully.
 Imitation of intensive aquaculture methods commonly employed by farmers in Taiwan and Singapore can raise average fish yields in South Asian, African and Latin American countries 25-fold.
 Advanced methods for micro-nutrient management can double or quadruple fruit and vegetable yields in most developing countries.
 A complete list of proven but untapped technologies and commercial opportunities should be compiled for each country, each region and local area.
 Programmes should be initiated to publicize information about commercialization of agriculture, stimulating industrialization, encouraging self-employment and new business start-ups, improving management practices, etc.

A few minutes later Alec bundled me into the back seat of an unfamiliar car, which rapidly filled up as first Jasmin, Isaac and the tiny Hispanic girl arrived.
 Jasmin completely ignored me as she climbed into the car; Isaac gave me a polite, if somewhat cool nod.
 The Hispanic girl gave me an honest-to-goodness smile as she slipped behind the steering wheel and started the engine.
 In what was one of the most thoughtful things that'd happened all night, she turned the heater on full as she pulled out of the driveway.
 The drive into town, and then back out to my house was quiet, but luckily didn't take as long as normal.
 Apparently her timidness stopped well short of observing the speed limit.
 Alec, Isaac, and Jasmin all jumped out of the car as soon as my house was in sight.
 The car was still doing at least twenty miles per hour when they bailed.
 They faded into the darkened landscape about the time we rolled to a stop.
 I went to open the door, but a delicate brown hand stopped me.

Everything oozed elegance, to a point that even the half-orcs knew was over the top.
 When Harruq looked behind him, the darkness had left the door.

 ‚ÄúAmazing no one ever robbed this guy before,‚Äù he said.

 The half-orc shrugged, drew his swords, and began walking.

The expansion of agricultural exports under the new GATT agreement is likely to exacerbate the falling commodity price syndrome to the great detriment of the entire world economy, unless effective mechanisms are introduced to stabilize international commodity prices.
 Of the many efforts in the past, some were tried and failed, many were proposed but never implemented.
 The recent success of coffee-producing countries in lifting prices from a disastrously low level has been an exception to the rule.
 Collective and coordinated international action is essential to address this problem.
 Despite past failures, new efforts must be made to revive international commodity agreements, preferably covering both producing and consuming countries.
 This will be possible only if developing countries first arrive at a consensus approach among themselves, including the economic costs and benefits, and a financing plan.
 Financing for international commodity stocks could be supplied partly by producer countries in the form of building national stocks under collective supervision.
 Partly, it could come from bank commercial loans against commodity collateral, loans from regional development banks, the World Bank and IMF's Buffer Stock Facility, which has remained almost unused.
 8.Technology transfer: Accelerate transfer of technology to and between developing countries.
 One or more profit-making commercial organizations should be established as a public sector joint venture of developing countries to promote the commercial transfer of technology to, within and between developing countries and to channel the profits from this activity toward research in these countries.

All of the time.
 Until now we always thought someone had to be a shape shifter to do that."
 "But I'm just a normal person.
 Why would I appear different than anyone else?"
 Alec's shrug was enough to send my heart racing again, but not enough to distract me from his words.
 "With shape shifters, we believe it's because the animating energy, the soul if you will, burns more brightly than normal.
 I think it's tied in with what allows us to shift forms.
 With you, there isn't any obvious reason, but I think that Dominic has probably hit upon the root of the matter."

Ironically, Brandon was working the detox center on the day of his one-year anniversary of sobriety.
 Brandon told us that it suddenly struck him as he sat on the bathroom floor comforting a young man as he convulsed and withered in pain.
 Brandon was the young man on the floor twelve months ago and he had no idea who comforted him that day but he remembered his compassion well.
 He had evolved in a short year from the position of a detoxing addict receiving compassion to the position of a former addict providing compassion.
 Brandon is giving back!
 Brandon considers the staff and students his second family.
 We don‚Äôt see Brandon often because he works in the ‚Äúboonies‚Äù many hours away but we talk to him almost every night.
 He usually calls us late after his shift ends around 11 pm.

All I know is that I never thought much about having kids until I had one.

Our son was immediately labeled a snitch on the street and had no chance of helping the police.
 Our phone began ringing with crank calls and threats on his life and ours.
 The officers were apologetic; it was apparently an honest mistake.

 Brandon was facing five years in prison.
 I was pissed off that the cops fucked this up!

Rick woke up slowly with no idea of how long he'd been asleep.
 It had been an exhausting week, and he'd gotten less sleep than usual.
 Of course, he'd had much more fun than usual too, he thought with a lazy smile.
 He turned to see if Marie was asleep.
 She wasn't there!
 Springing to his feet, he looked around.
 The beach had become crowded while he was asleep, and he didn't see her anywhere.
 "Marie!"
 he called in a moderately loud voice.
 Maybe she'd gone for a swim.

If I made it through the next two hours without having an attack it would be a miniature miracle.
 Halfway through the walk to my normal table I looked up and saw Rachel smiling at me with almost the exact same innocent, convincing smile her brother had used on me just a couple of hours before.
 My insides simultaneously tensed up with hurt and relaxed in happiness.
 The best I could really have expected out of the experience would have been to stay on an even keel, but instead it was almost as if part of my frustration evaporated.
 I still wasn't ready to get up and sing any songs, but it was starting to at least look like I might manage to finish out the day.
 Especially surprising considering my current mental state, it only took me half an hour to finish up the two Algebra sections I'd assigned myself.
 Mrs. Campbell stopped by my desk a few seconds after I finished up.
 "We don't really need the extra help until later.
 Is it okay if you just start at the same time you did last night?"
 She accepted my nod at face value, but then paused in the act of turning away.

The rapidly falling value of local currencies minimized their utility as a medium of exchange.
 Agricultural as well as industrial enterprises seeking a stable medium in which to hold their wealth increasingly resorted to hoarding marketable, non-perishable commodities such as food grains or converting local currency into foreign money wherever possible.
 This was particularly devastating for agriculture, where higher production was desperately needed to meet consumer demand and reduce dependence on food imports.
 The breakdown of the local currency as an effective medium of exchange was accompanied by an unfavourable shift in the terms of trade between agriculture and industry, resulting from the near-monopolistic position both of the suppliers of farm inputs, especially fertilizers and farm machinery, and the processing units that purchased farm produce, such as dairies and meat processing plants.
 Together, these factors precipitated a rapid fall in farm production and food availability.
 There can be no solution to the food problem without first establishing a stable medium of exchange.
 5.Macro-level policy must be complemented by micro-level change: Putting in place the right macro-level policies may be necessary, but it is far from sufficient to create a functioning market.
 The governments of the region have been so preoccupied with ‚Äòre-engineering‚Äô their economic and political systems and with meeting the conditions to attract foreign aid and investment that they have tended to over look the many essential and practical steps needed to implement the reforms on the ground.
 Even if governments had been able to get all the laws and economic policies ‚Äòright‚Äô the first time, there is no assurance that the actual impact on the people would have been less harsh than it has been.

Fear rushed through me and I wrapped my fists around the hilt of my own sword, praying I could protect myself.
 A smile was the only warning Chevelle gave before his blade cut the air.
 Instinct took over and I flung my arms up to block his swing with my own.
 The metal clashed and I felt the shock vibrate through me even as the peal pulsed in my ears.
 He struck again and I pulled the sword back, twisting to block another shot.
 I straightened and raised it back, surprised at how powerful I felt the moment before releasing my blow.
 I smiled as I swung at him, sure he would stop me but reveling in being attacker instead of victim.
 He wound his blade around mine, a metallic screech filling my ears as he knocked my strike aside before coming back at me.

He wouldn‚Äôt have been lonely if he‚Äôd married Kim or Gina or Sabrina, but he wouldn‚Äôt have been happy.
 Even sex was no longer enough to motivate him to get into a relationship like those.

 He wanted someone he could relax with when he came home from work, not someone he had to work to please.
 All his married buddies told him he was dreaming, that marriage was a strain, a series of trade-offs.
 But he couldn‚Äôt help hoping there was something better than that.

Unlike most of the people I knew, I managed to be truly a recreational user with no tendencies towards addiction.
 But I am no prude, and we had our share of parties and events in Tahoe and at the waterbed store.
 When you put a bunch of twenty year olds and their friends in a retail store that has working hot tubs and waterbeds, things can quickly spiral out of control.
 We had no window coverings and our parties were in plain view of anyone who put their nose against the windows.
 It was a voyeurs‚Äô paradise and I am sure we entertained a lot of shocked window shoppers late into the night!
 Pete proved to be a bad choice of a business partner, as his use of cocaine escalated to the point of total addiction.
 In less than a year he would snort everything he could get his hands on.
 He was stealing money from the checking account and drop-shipping inventory from our business directly to drug dealers to feed his habit.
 My own brother Thomas was one of the many drug dealers receiving this merchandise for pennies on the dollar in exchange for cocaine and marijuana.

Jobs are created by our innate human resourcefulness and ingenuity, expressed as invention, innovation and social imitation.
 The ultimate determinant of the number and quality of jobs in future will not be physical or even financial constraints, but ‚Äì ‚Äòscience, technology, values and social organization ‚Äì in a word, the human imagination‚Äô.
 Trading Jobs
 Those in the West who do not blame rising unemployment on technological advancement, usually blame it on trade.
 Business and economic literature is replete with articles stating that the high-wage industrial nations will suffer rising levels of unemployment due to the growth of imported goods from low-wage developing countries.
 The completion of the Uruguay round of GATT trade negotiations was delayed for years because this view fostered protectionist sentiment in the bastion of free trade Western nations.
 This issue elicits heated emotional debate that often overlooks obvious facts.
 For instance, increasing trade with East Asia and with low-wage developing countries is cited as a major cause of the fall in the wages of unskilled workers in the United States.
 As in the case of technology, there is evidence that free trade destroys jobs in some industries, especially unskilled or low-skilled jobs in high-wage economies.
 In some instances the devastating impact of increasing imports may justify a gradual approach to removing trade barriers.

He turned to see if Marie was asleep.
 She wasn't there!
 Springing to his feet, he looked around.
 The beach had become crowded while he was asleep, and he didn't see her anywhere.
 "Marie!"
 he called in a moderately loud voice.
 Maybe she'd gone for a swim.
 His heart pounded as he ran toward the waves.
 He hoped she had enough sense not to go out very far.

Several men in front of him turned away, dejected or angry.
 He didn‚Äôt hear the reasons why and didn‚Äôt want to know.
 The idea of so much money, more than enough to buy warm food and clean drink, kept him there.
 At last it was his turn, and he approached the table where Alvrik sat chewing on a piece of bone long since void of meat.

 I already wished I could take it back, but it was too late.
 It took less than half a second for him to figure out who I was talking about.
 "They don't hate you.
 A few of them are scared almost senseless, but nobody hates you."
 "They were willing to kill me.
 They wanted to trade me back to Brandon."
 It came out as something less than a whisper, but apparently Alec's hearing was acute enough to catch that too.

Moonlight glinted off Ruby‚Äôs figure in the distance, heading away from the village.
 I didn‚Äôt think.
 I just pulled a cloak from the pile on her bed and was out the hidden door behind the wardrobe.
 I ran in a crouch, praying no one spotted me as I gained on her.
 I only once glanced at the house in the fear I wouldn‚Äôt be able to find my way back.
 If I wanted to catch Ruby, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to mark my path.
 Her cloaked form leapt over a tall rock and disappeared.
 I hurried forward, sure I was about to lose both her and the route.
 When I topped the rock, I froze, taking a heartbeat too long to drop to my stomach.
 Just over that ridge stood a group of elves, though after my pulse settled, I didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd seen me before I‚Äôd fallen back.

Everyone had treated her like an eager tourist, little realizing that she was seeing it all from the perspective of someone who'd seen debuts of Hollywood's earliest offerings.
 "Would you like to go dancing?"
 Rick asked as he paid the bill.
 "I don't think so.
 I'm rather tired, and I think I'd just like to relax and think about all that happened today."
 "And dream about your debut?"

Export of commercial services already accounts for 20 per cent of world trade.
 The shift from manufacturing to services is a positive and inevitable expression of the elevation of human activity from the physical to the mental level, which is the central reason for the phenomenal rise in global living standards over the past century.
 Rich nations have become rich through a shift of workers from the primary farm sector to value-added, non-farm secondary and tertiary sectors.
 Poverty and hunger persist so long as a majority of the population depend upon the routine operations of farming for their livelihood.
 This is also the cause of the growing feminization of poverty in developing countries.
 Today‚Äôs developed nations arrived at their present position by a long, slow migration from agriculture to manufacturing to service sector, but that does not mean developing countries must follow the same path.
 The growing demand for services in the developed world coupled with rapid strides in telecommunications has created the possibility of skipping steps to abridge the development process.
 Even within developing countries, surging demand for education, health care, tourism, communication, financial and retail services has opened up opportunities that were available to the developed countries only at a much later stage in their development.
 Outsourcing: During the last decade enormous attention has been focused on the lucrative employment potentials generated by Information and Communication Technology (ICT), particularly the high paid jobs in computer software and hardware and the less technical jobs in business process outsourcing.
 Countries such as India have shown that they can leapfrog into the technological vanguard by developing qualified human resources to meet the ever-expanding shortage in these sectors.

Alec was well on his way to being fully healed, while I still had fits of dizziness every time I tried to stand.
 I even had to have Jasmin or Dom help me to the bathroom.
 There was no good way to know how long I'd lain there with a branch stuck through my back, but it'd been long enough for even a relatively small wound to result in near fatal blood loss.
 I'd been nearly unconscious from the pain, so I didn't remember any of what had happened next, but Alec had reluctantly filled in most of the details.
 Apparently the stress of the fight had finally awakened his potential, and his power was a real humdinger.
 The metaphysical hurricane that'd knocked me to the ground had actually been Alec pulling power from all of the shape shifters and humans in the area.
 The experience had been nearly as overwhelming for Alec as it had been for the rest of us.
 He'd recovered just in time to find Brandon grimly pulling himself along on all fours.
 Luckily Alec had recovered more quickly, and once Brandon was deprived of the strength and speed¬†his¬†power had bestowed upon him, Alec had been more than a match for him, even wounded and exhausted.
 Brandon's end had been quick, and if Alec hadn't realized my blood was slowly leaking out onto the ground, the rest of Brandon's pack would've likewise been quickly sorted out.

 Almost before I realized what was going on, I found myself twirling through some kind of modified waltz.
 For the first time in my life, I was glad Dad had drilled me for all of those weeks when I'd turned twelve.
 My first dance had still been complete and utter misery, but at least I managed not to trip over my own feet as Alec led me around the room in time to archaic music.
 The rest of the pack fell into formation around us, all dancing much more proficiently than me.
 James and Dominic led the way, with Jasmin and Rachel dancing off to our left.

I have been too busy working on my studies.‚Äù Korin now looked at him with a surprised expression and an eyebrow slightly raised.
 Rodregas wondered if he had said something wrong.
 While he had seen the two interact for some years, he really did not know what was appropriate for him to say in such a circumstance.
 Rodregas knew that he did not have the skills for pretending he was a powerful Immortalist sorcerer, so he said, ‚ÄúHow many people have you killed during the past year Korin?
 And how many others have you raped or tortured?‚Äù he asked, trying to keep a calm voice.
 Now Korin looked very surprised and he started looking around.
 Rodregas saw that Korin noticed the study door, though he was working hard to not show it.
 ‚ÄúHow many?‚Äù Rodregas repeated his question.
 ‚ÄúI am not sure,‚Äù Korin said.

‚ÄúHow much I wish for your pride to suffer.‚Äù Magical energy rippled out of him and tore across the air.
 The elf whirled, sensing the incoming invisible blow.
 Only a tiny part hit his shoulder, immediately encasing it in ice.
 Then Harruq was upon him, slashing recklessly.
 Ahrqur batted his sword left and right, then jumped as Harruq swung back in a scissor-cut that should have shredded his waist.
 The elf landed atop one of his couches, balancing with ease.
 ‚ÄúWhat reason do you have to kill me?‚Äù the elf asked.
 ‚ÄúAre you here for money?
 I could pay you twice the pittance you work for.‚Äù

He'd sunk down beside me while he was talking, resting with his hands behind his head so he could look up at the few thinly-stretched clouds.
 I took the opportunity to move closer, cuddling up next to him.
 I didn't bother looking up at the sky.
 Truth be told, I had all the beauty I needed right in front of me.
 His slight start as my head came to rest on his arm was disappointing but entirely predictable.
 He adjusted my blanket slightly so it was between us and then pulled me closer.
 He was perfectly happy to touch me as long as there wasn't any actual skin on skin contact.
 Every time I pushed for more he backed away or found somewhere else he had to be.

Jasmin had told him I'd overheard her death threats, and he'd decided to use his good looks to convince me to keep quiet.
 Only he hadn't been able to keep the act up for more than just a few seconds.
 I must really repulse him.
 Physics was my own little personal hell for the next forty minutes.
 I absorbed absolutely nothing from the rest of the discussion about calculating mechanical advantage, and when we were finally released into our groups Alec and I didn't even look each other in the eyes.
 I gutted out the last five minutes by pretending I was completely absorbed in a reference book while Alec started running preliminary calculations.
 He was out of his seat and halfway to the door by the time I'd even realized the bell had rung to dismiss us.
 Spanish was both better and worse.
 Better because without Alec sitting six feet away from me I was able to think about something other than him, worse because we had a pop quiz and I barely placed in the A- range despite having spent a fair amount of time on my vocabulary.
 Math was plain and simply burning up too much time.

Almost before I knew it we were rolling to a stop in my driveway.
 I fumbled, for the latch, but Rachel put a hand on my arm before I could get the door open.
 She handed me a white-wrapped package with a shy smile.
 "Hang in there.
 Oh, and happy birthday.
 Don't open it now, but I hope you like it."
 I whispered thanks as I hugged her goodbye, and then made my halting, limping way into the house.
 I was only in the house for fifteen minutes before I realized being all by myself was a terrible idea.
 At some point I transitioned from just crying to having a full-blown panic attack.

Hundreds of soldiers stacked against it, their shields braced and ready.

 ‚ÄúI know what I‚Äôm doing.‚Äù
 He led them into an alley in between several worn buildings made of stone.
 He stopped just before the next set of homes, for he heard talking.
 Holding Qurrah back, he peered around the corner to find a soldier dressed in finely polished armor raising his sword in salute.
 At first Harruq did not see who he saluted, but an elf fell from the roof and landed before the soldier.

 I was perfectly happy with the way everything was right now until I saw the small outline of a toad dwarf nearby.
 ‚ÄúUh Seth I don't think this is the best time to mention this but I think we have company.‚Äù I pointed to the shape.
 He swore under his breath, and we both entered the dwarf's world together.
 Sure enough, it was a dwarf but there was something strangely different about this particular dwarf.
 He just walked toward us as if he wasn't afraid that I might put an arrow through his head.

 CHET Whispers From the Past
 By Larry Murray
 Meet Charles Tucker, he has spent nearly 30 years living in denial, trying desperately to hide from his past and the events that shattered his heart beyond any possibility of healing.
 He can't let anyone close, for doing so would open him up to being hurt again, and there's no way he could survive another wounding.

‚ÄúI think I need to change shields,‚Äù he said.
 Doi‚Äôvan glanced at what remained of Rodregas‚Äô shield and simply nodded and handed him one of their other shields.
 It was not in great shape, but it was whole.
 Rodregas watched a few of the other matches before it was his turn again.
 Except for him, everyone remaining wore full plate.
 Rodregas‚Äô next opponent was shining in the sun in his steel; which was better than him having to face Night Bronze plate, but still not very reassuring.
 The flag fell and Rodregas dug his heals into Doom Hoof‚Äôs side and the mount plodded forward.
 His opponent‚Äôs horse looked almost as powerful, but much faster.
 The collision happened before Rodregas was fully expecting it and he felt himself hit the ground and hit it hard.
 ‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù Rodregas muttered to himself, ‚ÄúHe has a Dire Steed and full plate armor.‚Äù Rodregas rolled over and pushed himself up, Doom Hoof stood nosing the sand looking for food.

Instead of investing in ambitious, high-tech projects whose future impact on job creation is unclear, the industrial nations should make sub stantial increases in public investment to improve the tools of the work force by lending to promote small enterprises together with increased public investment in education and training, which will stimulate short-, medium- and long-term job growth.
 The recommendations set forth in this report are based on the conviction that nothing less than a legal commitment of the society to guarantee employment is justified and nothing less will be sufficient to solve the problem.
 Only then can the requisite political will be generated to push through effective measures.
 We do not advocate a return to state socialism or expansion of the public sector.
 As in the case of the environment, the changes needed are in the priority given to achieving different social objectives in the formulation of government policy.
 Recommendations to Achieve Full Employment in Industrial Nations
 Earlier we noted long-term trends that suggest the recent rise in unemployment in the West does not necessarily forebode, and need not necessarily result in, chronically higher rates of unemployment in these countries.
 Granted that the necessary political and social commitment is forthcoming, there are a range of strategies which, taken in the proper measure and combination, can dramatically accelerate job growth and reduce unemployment.
 Each of these strategies has proved effective in stimulating employment, though none by itself may be sufficient to solve the problem.
 A comprehensive, total approach, rather than partial and half-way measures, is needed.

 Imeralda saw that Rodregas was also watching Doi‚Äôvan.
 She thought he also recognized the danger of a Hellborn rage.
 Imeralda reached out to Rodregas first to try to get him to calm down and help manage Doi‚Äôvan.
 Imeralda focused on their bond and looked him in the eyes and said, ‚ÄúRodregas getting angry will not change things, let‚Äôs sit down and talk to the village elders.
 They are thankful for what we have done.

"The first winner is Pam White."
 Somewhere down the hall I heard someone yell, and then an entire class broke out into cheers.
 I knew I should be happy for Pam, but I was too busy wishing everyone would quiet down so we could hear the next name.
 Mrs. Alexander shut the door, muting the roar as Principal Gossil continued with a slight rustle of papers.
 "Also winning a ticket to Les Mis√©rables next weekend, Mr. Andrew Webbs."
 A couple of half-hearted cheers broke out towards the front of the class, but they were short-lived.
 Andrew wasn't in the class, and his friends were probably spending almost as much time thinking about their odds of still winning, as I was.
 I only had three chances left, three in two hundred assuming that everyone else in the school had entered the drawing, which was virtually guaranteed.
 "And the third lucky person is Suzanne Bergerman."
 And my chances were down to two, with even worse odds than I'd had a second before.

There was no mistaking the look on her face; it was utter distaste, possibly with a dash of disdain.
 I was so tired of it all.
 By the time English rolled around my natural embarrassment had given way to actual anger at Britney for starting it all.
 She tried to catch me at our lockers in between classes, but I pretended not to hear her, and made it safely into Mr. Whethers' class before she could catch up.
 Part of me acknowledged how petty it was, but I avoided her attempts at a whispered conversation during class.
 Mr. Whethers unknowingly helped my cause, when he crossly silenced a couple of girls on the far side of the classroom.
 He was normally so even-tempered that even his moderate rebuke instantly shut them up.
 I probably shouldn't have felt quite so happy about it, but I was pretty sure from the way they'd been looking at me that I'd been the source of their gossip.

We kept shopping for a place that could assure us that we just weren‚Äôt introducing our son to more drug addicts who would help each other continue their abuse.
 Every agency we contacted seemed to be selling something, and they were pushy and wanted money transferred to them now, offering to pick Brandon up immediately.
 We felt like we were buying a used car from some slickster.
 We didn‚Äôt have the money for what most of these places cost but we knew he needed their help or he could be just another statistic.
 This was so far out of our realm of understanding and far from our abilities to negotiate.
 A maze of tangled claims and questionable results.
 Brandon also needed to be available to the narcotics officers to fulfill his end of a bargain he had struck with them during his brief incarceration.
 We decided to try to detox him as long as it took for him to get his arrangement with the narcotics officers completed, and then we would continue to find a state run program to admit him or reach our hands out to our family, who until now had primarily been kept in the dark.

He held nothing back.
 He weaved his swords through three stabs, feinted a high slash, and then twirled up and around for a low thrust.

 A sword cut a thin line across the green fabric of her dress but did not touch skin.
 She thought Harruq might stop and claim the cut counted.

Although the long-term impact of the Yugoslav experiment is an yet unknown, its remarkably positive initial results merit serious consideration.
 The economic disorder that accompanied recent political developments in Yugoslavia resulted in an explosive increase in prices of more than 100 per cent per month in 1992.
 Despite efforts to control monetary expansion, hyperinflation exceeded three million per cent in 1993 - far higher than the inflation rate reached in Germany following the First World War and, quite probably, the highest rate in recorded history.
 The price spiral was accompanied by a steep fall in real purchasing power by as much as 75 per cent.
 The budget deficit increased rapidly as the value of government tax revenues fell further and further behind the rising cost in current terms of its expenditures, due to the time lag between tax declaration, collection and expenditure in a period of very rapid price increases.
 In January 1994, the government embarked on a comprehensive monetary reconstruction programme to achieve price and exchange rate stability; to remove administrative controls over production, investment, prices, salaries, and interest rates; to re-establish the role of the central bank in monetary stability; to reorganize public finances through an efficient tax system, including more efficient tax collection and better coverage of the lage `grey' economy; to reduce government administrative and defence expenditure to the maximum possible extent; to maintain price supports for important agricultural commodities as an incentive for production; to stimulate economic activities of private, cooperative and public sector enterprises through equal access to credit and government facilities; and to encourage the takeover of sick firms by stronger, more efficient companies.
 At the same time, the programme was intended to mitigate the harsher effects of shock therapy programme was intended to mitigate the harsher effects of shock therapy programmes on the working class and fixed-income pensioners by providing free scope for collective bargaining, enforcement of a minimum wage policy and a social safety net for the unemployed.
 It was recognized from the outset that stability of the currency was an absolute precondition for the success of the reform programme, which depended in turn on the firmness and consistency with which it was implemented.
 The central element of the programme was the introduction of a new currency, the `superdinar', in parallel to the existing currency, but without demonetizing or confiscating it.
 Inspired by an experiment in the Soviet Union during the 1920s, the value of the new currency was tied to that of the Deutsche Mark and made fully convertible without restriction.

ntroduce the new currency,92m strains0m on monetary policy will increase dramatically.92m The0m deficit will suffer particularly.

It was an insane experience.
 This law has been sold to voters by showing cancer patients and other sick people who need this drug to ease symptoms, but the teenagers of the state have exploited this, now that it is law.
 When I went from the ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù to the dispensary, I didn‚Äôt see any of the sad beneficiaries they always show on television; the handicapped and sickly were nowhere to be seen.
 It actually resembled a fraternity party except for the glass cases displaying an array of pot labeled with colorful names, potency and detailed descriptions, which read like something on the back of a wine label: The ‚ÄúOrange Crush‚Äù had ‚Äúhints of berry with a smooth finish.‚Äù That is about as far as I got into the room before my presence stuck out like a parent at a kegger party.
 I was by far the oldest guy in the room.
 I was approached and asked for my license, which, of course I showed.
 I was given the grand tour and a detailed break down of how each different bud worked better for different symptoms.
 This one is for sleeplessness, this one for appetite stimulation, this one for back pain, and this one‚Äîbelieve it or not‚Äî is for asthma.
 It was absurd.
 I know there are people out there who claim they need this drug, but those people were not my son or half of the high school, nor did anyone at this dispensary seem to be suffering from anything but red squinty eyes.

As in the case of technology, research is needed to document this complex process across industries, between countries and over time.
 One product of these studies could be the development of specific job coefficients measuring the impact of growth in trade in different industries on overall employment.
 Trade becomes of even greater potential benefit to industrial nations during the coming decade when economic growth in these countries is expected to be significantly slower than in the developing world.
 The pent-up demand generated by the destruction of Europe during the Second World War, the rapid expansion of population during the baby boom generation, and the explosion of new technologies in the past few decades, all generated strong internal demand in the OECD countries, resulting in steady economic growth.
 The slow growth of population and productivity in more recent years means that these factors cannot be expected to drive further economic expansion at the same rate.
 In contrast, average growth rates in developing countries are expected to be two to three times higher than in the industrial nations.
 The increase in the dollar output of developing countries was actually bigger than that of the most economically advanced nations in 1992 and 1993, and this trend is expected to continue.
 Measured in terms of purchasing power parity, developing countries now represent more than one-third of the world economy.
 More than 40 per cent of US exports now go to developing countries and two-thirds of the increase in US exports in recent years has gone to these nations.
 The rising expectations and upward mobility of millions of people in developing countries represent a vast potential source of demand, higher incomes and jobs for the West.

2.A major UN Conference should be convened to examine UN institutional reform, including the composition and powers of both the Security Council and the General Assembly.
 The objective should be to restructure the UN according to the same democratic principles advocated by its members for national governments.
 3.As an interim step in this necessary restructuring, the Commission recommends expanding the membership of the Security Council from 15 to 20 members by adding five new permanent members.
 The veto power of the five permanent members of the Security Council should be abolished and the diplomatic status of the UN Secretary General should be elevated to that of a head of state.
 4.A detailed plan should be drawn up by the UN for a further 50 per cent reduction, to a maximum of $400 billion, in global defence spending before the end of the decade.
 Spending quotas for member states should be established according to the principle of non-offensive defence.
 5.The peace-making, peace-keeping and peace-enforcing capabilities of the UN should be strengthened substantially.
 A permanent, well equipped UN force made up from 20‚Äì30 member states should be placed at the disposal of the Secretary General for rapid deployment in conflict zones under Article 43 of the UN Charter to enforce the decisions of the Security Council.
 Either the Military Staff Committee of the UN could be revitalized to give strategic direction to any enforcement action, or a new structure should be created of member states supplying troops to any UN operation, chaired by the Secretary General.
 Member States should earmark national troops for use in UN Chapter VII enforcement action, the scope of which should be expanded to include humanitarian intervention under circumstances when national governments are either unable or unwilling to protect their populations from imminent threats to their survival.

 Strangely, the room did not smell of damp stone like the rest of the cathedral, but the air smelled of the outdoors in spring.

When the traffic spreads out, I find time to think about the story I heard at Chapter‚Äôs Books, and about how I would answer God if he told me to ditch Zo√´.
 The first words that come to mind are, ‚ÄúGet lost, please.‚Äù I listen to my I-pod until a song reminds me, if I hope to achieve the peace Brother Lawrence lived in, I need to surrender.
 I think about Olga's poem and begin to doubt I should pray those words.
 After all, Olga had no kids.
 If God asked me to surrender Zo√´, not just deliver her into his care in some spiritual sense, but say to give her up, send her to live with her mother or grandma, I believe I would rescind any surrender pledge I had made.
 Meaning I‚Äôm probably light years from honest to God surrender.
 And perhaps I‚Äôm light years from devoting myself to communion with God.
 Even on lesser matters than Zo√´, such as writing books and building the Perelandra College writing programs (another of my obsessions), I hesitate to cut back in order to devote more time to communing with God.
 Even during these meditative times on the road, since Pismo Beach I have devoted as much to thoughts of the book that will come of the journey as to whether it all will help me live more like Brother Lawrence.
 I wonder, if I were given the choice between writing a wonderful book or achieving deeper communion, which would I choose?

‚ÄúNow what did the dwarf tell you, Seth?‚Äù she asked.
 ‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòYou won‚Äôt stop him, little warrior.‚Äô‚Äù He frowned at the last part.
 Emily added, Toad Dwarf told Seth, ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt stop him, little warrior.‚Äù Does this mean he‚Äôs powerful?
 ‚ÄúDid you have to add the ‚Äòlittle warrior‚Äô part?

It helped that the Mercedes was so smooth, and that I knew Jasmin had reflexes and reaction time that would've made any Indy racer insanely jealous.
 Apparently there wasn't a single cop on duty, because we made it into downtown Vegas in what I was sure was record time.
 It had to be.
 Jasmin hadn't dropped below triple digits until we were less then fifteen minutes from exiting the interstate.
 It wasn't until we hit the first store that I started to get an idea of what Donovan had been hinting at.
 The shyness Rachel normally exhibited at school was replaced by supreme confidence the moment we crossed the threshold of the first store.
 Armani, Versace, Prada, we conducted a tour de force of them all along with others whose names I didn't even recognize.
 The shopping trip was ostensibly for me, but Rachel cajoled both Jasmin and Dominic into dressing rooms on more than one occasion.
 Amazingly enough, everything she picked out for them fit so perfectly that I began to agree with them that there wasn't much point in even trying anything on.

 Mom paused in her preparations to put her hand on my forehead.
 "You're not coming down with anything, are you?
 You've been so listless lately.
 Do you need me to stay home with you?"
 There it was, the perfect opportunity to get her to stay home with me.
 It would get me out of having to spend time with Brandon's increasingly annoying friends, which was what I currently wanted more than almost anything else in the world.

I didn't relent until after his mom lectured us in practically the same words.
 Whatever the meaning of Eric‚Äôs death, it might've been losing him that convinced me to give up on Karen Flagstad.
 Anymore, the whole idea of having a best friend spooked me.
 Better to keep my secret life to myself and guard my heart than to trust somebody I was almost sure to lose---because that was how life worked---and mourn over.
 But then, in that way life has of confusing every issue, Karen invited me to be her graduation partner, which meant only walking side-by-side in a procession.
 Still I invited her to the prom.
 She accepted.
 Then a girl passed along a rumor that Liz Pence wanted to go out with me.
 Liz was a beauty.
 We dated a few times before the prom, and she would've preferred that I give Karen notice and take her instead.

Brandon pulled into his normal parking spot, cut the engine and grabbed my hand before I could open the door.
 "Hey, you'd tell me if you knew about anything I should know, right?

 For a second nothing made sense.
 Brandon was the one who was saving us, and if that wasn't out of the ordinary, I didn't know what would be.
 Only he'd said in his note not to say anything to anyone.
 Of course.
 He was testing me, making sure I was going to keep quiet about what he'd done.
 Probably because he didn't want any of the praise for such a selfless act.
 I was usually a pretty lousy liar, but it isn't really a lie if you both know the truth.

How could she have acted that way?
 Rick set the pizza on the table and picked up some change to go get them some Cokes.
 He knew Marie would be embarrassed.
 Women of 1927 weren't supposed to be so forward with a man, even if they weren't, as she was, engaged to another.
 But her kiss and the way she'd touched him made him think that maybe he could win her love.
 Maybe he could convince her to stay in 2011 with him.
 He returned to the room with the Cokes and opened the box.
 "Mmm‚Äîit smells great."
 He put a slice on a plate and handed it to her.

My shoulders suddenly relaxed as everything started to make sense.
 There'd been an attack of course.
 There might have even been a bit of a cover-up by local, or regional, authorities, but Britney's father was probably right in assuming the motivation had been protecting the tourist industry.
 That was all straightforward, but even that wasn't as obvious as the fact that Britney was suffering from some kind of survivor's guilt.
 She felt like she was somehow to blame for not dying with her friends, and was reading all kinds of motivations into people's behavior that weren't even there.
 That would've been spooky enough, but then I'd turned around, linked all of it to a freak nightmare and been convinced the world was about to end.
 Silly.
 I did my best to comfort Britney after that, but was more than a little relieved when lunch finally ended.
 That of course made me feel heartless and guilty in turn, but I was still too fragile to deal with her issues.

A visible wave of distorted reality crossed the distance between the necromancer and Ahrqur.
 The elf crossed his arms against the blow.
 His mind was nearly overwhelmed by the sudden tearing sensation that hit him.
 Blood splattered from two horrid gashes along his forearms, soaking the carpet crimson.
 He collapsed to one knee, his hands latched around his sword.
 He tried to raise the blade, but all the strength had left his hands.
 He had lost too much blood.
 When Harruq came charging forward, Condemnation red and hungry, all he could do was dodge.
 Condemnation shattered what remained of the table.

 "I really wish you'd just call for me when you need something.

 "You're not letting your injuries slow¬†you¬†down."
 It was a losing argument, but I hated being cooped up in bed all the time, and it was the only argument I had.
 Alec paused for a second to look down at the long, thick bandage wrapped around his middle.

His dark eyes drank in the light as he surveyed us with his typical boundless arrogance.
 A horde of shifting figures milled about just outside of the twin circles of light.
 The rest of Brandon's pack and they seemed to have grown in number since the dance.
 Jasmin and Dominic crowded up against me, one on either side, and I let my hands brush against their heads.
 The feel of their fur, one short and soft, the other long and coarse, anchored me before the surreal strangeness of the scene could carry me away.
 The tingle of shape shifter power was as strong as I'd ever felt it, jumping from multiple sources, arcing around me as it unsuccessfully looked for a place to ground out.
 For the first time, I was able to accurately pick out the individual signatures that made it up.
 Jess was off to the left, white hot with mixed anger and fear, stabilized only by the cool, controlled pillar of power that was Isaac.
 Jasmin almost hummed under my fingertips like barely-leashed violence, while my other hand drank from the still pond that was Dominic, her mere presence feeding me comfort.

The world possesses enough technology to double or triple the food supply in a decade, if only the world‚Äôs poorest two billion people have the purchasing power to consume it.
 So, too, the problem of employment.
 Humankind has employed itself ever since the dawn of civilization.
 So long as people have wants and are willing to work to fulfil them, there need not be a shortage of jobs for all who seek them.
 The problem today is not a shortage of money or technology.
 The problem is that we have constructed a hermetically sealed economic system that does not permit all people to express that willingness.
 Even if we reached the advanced stage of technological development that enabled one-tenth of the world‚Äôs population to produce all the goods and services to which all humanity could ever aspire, what would prevent us from distributing that work in such a manner as to provide everyone with the opportunity to acquire the purchasing power to consume their share of that over-abundance?
 The main limit on the production of sufficient goods to create prosperity for all is not material, financial, or technological.
 It is the inefficiency and arbitrariness of the present economic system that fails to take advantage of the vast latent market potential of nearly half the human race.
 Give these people the chance to work and they will create the markets to provide jobs and higher incomes for everyone.

He was supposed to bring drugs to a hotel room, but because Brandon owed everybody money, his credit to be fronted drugs was not good, so he went to the drug deal without the drugs, planning to get the money first then go back for them.
 When Brandon knocked on the hotel room door, it opened and an army of police officers darting in from all directions greeted him.
 They wrestled him to the ground, cuffed him and began their search of him and his vehicle and, later, his house.
 Brandon had been recorded agreeing to the deal and he had paraphernalia in his possession.
 Unfortunately for the police, they chose to drop the net on him when he had hit bottom and couldn‚Äôt afford the drugs they hoped they would catch him with.
 During his 23-hour period in jail, the narcotics officers shook him down for everything he was worth.
 The process of getting one drug dealer to set up the next is as old as the trade itself (my own brother had done it over 35 years before).
 During the interrogation, which included the usual scare tactics, the cops showed him a great deal of information they had collected on him.
 Even though they didn‚Äôt have the bust they wanted, they had him verbally agreeing to provide drugs and several people willing to testify that Brandon had provided them with Oxy and other drugs.
 They had been monitoring him for some time and had ample surveillance to make up for the lack of drugs at his actual bust.

Few developing countries ‚Äì perhaps few countries at any stage of development ‚Äì could have marshalled resources on such a massive scale and instituted such widespread changes so rapidly without heavy reliance on the government for both planning and execution.
 In the majority of developing countries, government is still the most organized and efficient agency and the only one capable of such significant initiative.
 In formulating strategies, it is essential to take fully into account both the stages and steps of the development process.
 At this stage in their development, it is highly unlikely that food-deficit African nations can make rapid progress toward food self-sufficiency without strong government support and investment to improve technology, training, techno-infrastructure and trade.
 Once the rural sector begins to exhibit its own dynamism, as in the majority of developing countries, there is strong justification for a shift in the role of government from that of prime mover, planner and controller of development to that of catalyst and pioneer.
 Government agencies can tap the potentials of agriculture, identifying new commercial opportunities, educating farmers, demonstrating new potentials, assisting in the transfer and dissemination of new technology, and promoting the establishment of effective organizations ‚Äì preferably privately or co-operatively owned by farmers or at least with their participation ‚Äì to process, distribute and market what is produced.
 Coping with the environmental problems to preserve the ecological foundations essential for sustainable agriculture is an area in which government has special responsibilities and must play a leading role on an ongoing basis.
 Regulating the diversion of prime farm land for non-farm uses, expansion of irrigation capacity, control of groundwater exploitation, major programmes for reforestation and to prevent or reverse desertification, and regulation of pesticide use can only be effectively planned, monitored and regulated by governments.

6.A cooperative collective security frame work must be evolved that is inclusive of all nations and guarantees their security against acts of external aggression.
 A standing international military force or World Army should be established under a democratic framework to provide unconditional security guarantees to member countries against aggression by other nations.
 If such a force cannot be established at the present time under the UN, then there is need for a separate organization similar in constitution to NATO but open to all nations that practise democratic principles of national governance, contribute financial and defence resources to a common armed force, accept ceilings on national defence expenditure and eschew the possession of nuclear weapons.
 The army should consist of both a directly recruited standing force and forces placed on call by member nations.
 7.The use of nuclear weapons should be declared by the UN a crime against humanity.
 First use by any nation must automatically invoke the strongest collective security measures by the UN Security Council.
 Based on the precedent of the Chemical Weapons Treaty, the proposal for a universal ban on the possession of nuclear weapons by any nation should be placed before the Security Council for a vote.
 The five permanent members should agree to the suspension of their veto power on this issue so crucial to the future of humanity.
 8.The danger to all nations of unexpected and unprovoked attack from near or distant powers can be vastly reduced by declaring an immediate ban on the use of ballistic missiles of all types, including those carrying conventional war heads.
 This would eliminate the discriminatory provisions that deny missile acquisition to some while preserving the right of others to maintain and develop this purely offensive capability.

 ‚ÄúHe simply wanted me to keep an eye out when I travel to the Cathedral of the Heavens,‚Äù he responded.
 The two of them were slowly walking back to his suite through the gleaming marble corridors with their wide windows and breath taking views of the city below; they both shared polite nods to other Immortalist, mostly young Adapts who resided in the city.
 She did not respond to his answer at first, finally she asked ‚ÄúDoes he want you to keep an eye out for Oreintvenir?‚Äù Van‚Äôdret shook his head and said.
 ‚ÄúHe mentioned Ravenhurr as a concern.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut, he simply went mad.

Broadening the scope to include other agricultural products, particularly textiles, the potential for accelerating global economic growth by an agriculture-led strategy is even greater.
 Cotton is a crop with a very high income and employment multiplier effect.
 Per capita cotton consumption in poorer developing countries such as India is less than half the level in China and less than a third the level in industrial nations.
 Measures of the gap between the prevailing levels of nutrition in developing countries and the levels achieved in the West reveal a huge potential for increasing demand for agricultural production, which can serve as an engine to drive the growth of the world economy.
 Extrapolation from ICPF‚Äôs studies of the employment potential of expanding agricultural production in India suggests that more than one billion jobs can be created worldwide through a strategy that focuses on raising agricultural productivity as an engine for improving diets, employment and industrialization.
 Challenges in Agriculture
 The ratio of growth of foodgrain production to population growth has entered into a period of decline over the past decade ‚Äì increasing at just one per cent per year compared to three per cent during the previous two decades.
 There is a similar trend for other staple crops and meat.
 For fish, there has actually been a net decline of seven per cent in per capita world production.
 To a large extent, this slowdown is the result of slower growth in demand, especially in industrial countries, under lining the fact that food security is predominantly an economic problem rather than a technological one.

roduction becomes a commodity for the West92m,0m advances in biotechnology developments such as GM92m foods0m and encourages demand by ratcheting up prices of processed food. which is why cooked92m food0m is viewed particularly poorly sold to‚Äì part of the census92m industry0m that has relied on a higher price to buy food at face value92m.0m<eop>

Carol Warner, I met at a school dance, where Black Lung played.
 It was in the school cafeteria‚ÄîJesus, those gigs, you gotta love ‚Äòem, right?

I was trying to figure out who had lifted it when Grey flashed back into view, hesitating only a moment as he considered the rock.
 At once, his face changed; he knew he‚Äôd been beaten.
 As he‚Äôd paused to study the floating rock, Steed had immobilized him and, just like that, the match was over.
 Ruby leaned into me, voice soft.
 ‚ÄúSteed is stronger than Grey.
 He only needed to catch him.‚Äù Grey conceded, his walk slower, movements no longer jerky as he made his way out of the makeshift ring.
 Steed threw me a quick wink.
 Anvil approached next, stepping into the same starting position Grey had used, and Steed shifted several paces back before he readied himself and nodded toward his new opponent.

Brandon also needed to be available to the narcotics officers to fulfill his end of a bargain he had struck with them during his brief incarceration.
 We decided to try to detox him as long as it took for him to get his arrangement with the narcotics officers completed, and then we would continue to find a state run program to admit him or reach our hands out to our family, who until now had primarily been kept in the dark.
 We were desperate for professional help.
 Chapter 16: The Law Brandon had been set up by another drug dealer.
 This person had called our son from a wired phone while Brandon was with his mother‚Äî that so-called errand was a drug deal.
 He left his mother to straighten out his bills while he went to do a drug deal.
 Unbelievable.
 He was supposed to bring drugs to a hotel room, but because Brandon owed everybody money, his credit to be fronted drugs was not good, so he went to the drug deal without the drugs, planning to get the money first then go back for them.
 When Brandon knocked on the hotel room door, it opened and an army of police officers darting in from all directions greeted him.

At the end of the Cold War, the organization needs to be re-founded, and restructured according to democratic principles, to give a more active role and more equitable representation to people of all nations.
 To deem such considerations unrealistic given the present alignment of power in the world is a short-sighted view.
 It ignores the incredible speed and scope of changes that have radically transformed international relations over the past half decade.
 It assumes that the present system has the backing of the international community and that it can and will sustain itself regardless of whatever steps we may contemplate.
 A fundamental change in structure is essential and inevitable.
 The break-up of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War have resulted in the demise of the bipolar system which dominated international relations after 1945.
 The United States is now recognized as the sole superpower and the primary determinant of actions by the UN Security Council.
 But neither America‚Äôs culture nor its historical economic and political development and present outlook will permit it to take on the extraordinary responsibilities and overseas commitments which fulfilment of this role necessitates, as its reluctance to get involved in Bosnia and Rwanda, and its quick withdrawal from Somalia illustrate.
 Indeed, no one nation can or should assume such responsibilities on behalf of the whole world.
 The rapid shift of Eastern European and former Soviet republics to radically different political and economic systems demonstrates that changes of even greater magnitude than this can be brought about rapidly.

Environment: Unsustainable lifestyles and consumption (in industrial countries) and population growth, along with rising levels of production and consumption (in developing countries), will place strenuous demands on the environment of the planet.
 Growing damage to the basic life support systems of soil, water, flora, fauna and the atmosphere is taking place in all parts of the world.
 Unemployment: In the West, rising levels of unemployment have increased resistance to free trade and immigration.
 Rising levels of long-term unemployment and youth unemployment in inner cities are associated with the increasing incidence of crime.
 In developing countries, rapid population growth continues to outpace job creation in most regions, resulting in high levels of unemployment, increasing social unrest and large scale migration from rural to urban areas and internationally.
 Gender discrimination: Gender remains a major determinant of privilege and discrimination worldwide.
 Women still suffer from unfavourable sex ratios, lower wages and restraints on property owner ship, as well as higher levels of illiteracy and lower educational attainments.

"I'd...we'd...spare you it if we could."
 It was my turn to shake my head.
 "No, this is my fault.
 I belong here, not cowering in a corner somewhere."
 Rachel hugged me from one side while Dominic placed a gentle, dark hand on my other shoulder, and then we were off.
 Brandon, and what must have amounted to his entire pack, were waiting for us just off school property.
 The two leaders faced off as everyone else fanned out around them.
 Jasmin, Isaac, and the others all maintained calm exteriors that were markedly different than the eager, often sadistic expressions of Brandon's people.

 Chapter 10
 Emily and Jason dashed back to our sides as the shadow became a body.
 It was bigger than the dragon we had rode.
 It had the body of a huge cockroach but its tail was a giant stinger.
 Large, bat wings were holding it up in the air.
 ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù I asked.
 I turned to Emily and said, ‚ÄúEmily, you know anything about this creature?‚Äù She looked pale.
 ‚ÄúIt's saying, 'Kill half-lings, kill and eat.
 '‚Äú ‚ÄúWell, you better tell it that it's going to have to starve this time because it's not going to be eating anything,‚Äù Seth said confidently and held his sword out.

I swam around in these impressions for what seemed like an eternity.
 Eventually, they became so familiar they all started to seem like my dreams, not someone else‚Äôs.
 Then the dreams stopped.
 No images flickered behind my lids, yet my eyes did not open.
 The muffle in my ears from the drowning dreams was gone.
 I could hear clearly, clearer than I‚Äôd ever heard.
 I hadn‚Äôt found my body yet, but I heard conversations, voices I knew.
 They were whispers but they were clear.

I waited until she stopped to talk to one of the cheerleaders about who was dating who, and then mumbled something about the bathroom, and made a break for it.
 Not wanting to out-and-out lie, I ducked into the nearest restroom.
 It was empty except for a mousy brunette I'd only seen a couple of times before.
 I smiled and started to open my mouth to say hi, but thought better of it.
 This was Sanctuary.
 She wasn't going to acknowledge the new girl was even breathing, let alone sentient.
 It should have bothered me, but I just shrugged it off and went to the far stall.
 A split second after I'd closed the door I heard the heavy wooden outer door open.
 Normally that wouldn't have caused me to even pause in my normal routine, but it suddenly felt as if the stall was too small.

 Dieredon nodded, the sparkle in his eyes fading.

 The elf whistled.
 From the night sky came the sound of soft wing beats.
 Then a white, winged horse swooped down, landing in front of Dieredon.
 ‚ÄúCome, Sonowin,‚Äù the elf said to his cherished companion.
 ‚ÄúLet us leave this place while it is still in peace.‚Äù

One of the slavers was human, the other a small Orqui or maybe a half breed.
 The human held a long sword, the Orqui a mace.
 Rodregas tried to think of a trick, but nothing came to mind.
 ‚ÄúI have to strike quickly before the odds get even worse.
 When nothing tricky comes to mind, work on the basics,‚Äù Rodregas thought.
 He stepped in closer and attacked, swinging one sword in a slashing forward swing and following up with a backhanded half slash that flowed into a half block.
 Neither was meant to do anything but feel this opponent out.
 The guard swung to try to meet his sword with his own instead of going after him.
 His sword lacked the shine of the ‚Äútrue silver‚Äù of Mithril.
 Instead it had the cast of blue steel, an enchanted steel / Mithril alloy.

I let my door swing shut, and walked over to Rachel's side so that I could see the entire parking lot.
 Empty as it was, it didn't take very long to realize Britney's little white Saturn was gone.
 "I thought you might still be here."
 The voice caught me by surprise.
 I probably would've jumped and screamed a little if I hadn't recognized it.
 Brandon was walking towards us with his characteristic casual stride, and I felt my heart speed up a little as I remembered our conversation from earlier in the day.
 "Brandon!
 What are you still doing here?"
 I heard some movement off to my right, but was so focused on Brandon's response that none of it really registered.
 The smile gracing his breathtaking face was like the ultimate treat.

"I'm sorry I wasn't around yesterday.
 Some things came up that demanded my attention."
 The music was lower than usual, a possible sign he wanted to talk?
 "Did you manage to resolve them successfully?"
 Again that incredible smile flashed across his face.
 "They were touch and go for a little bit, but I'm most pleased with how everything worked out."
 I'd spent all of Monday in a daze, and felt much the same now, only this time it was a daze of good fortune.
 It hardly bothered me when Britney snubbed me during English.
 I flew through my Algebra assignment, finishing up the one from yesterday as well as the one Mrs. Campbell assigned, before the bell rang to release us.
 The only thing that even threatened my bubble of happiness was when I walked into the lunchroom and saw that Britney was sitting with the cheerleaders who'd come and sat at our table yesterday.

If I really worked hard, maybe I'd be okay.
 Most teachers would still offer some kind of extra credit if you begged hard enough.
 I spent the next hour mapping out exactly how I was going to salvage my college prospects, and had more or less pulled myself together by the time English ended.
 My newfound dedication to excellence meant I outdid myself in Algebra.
 I finished up the day's homework, and made it more than halfway through one of my makeup assignments by the time Mrs. Campbell stopped off at my desk.
 "Care to run another errand for me, Adriana?"
 I didn't really want to.
 Not when I'd just discovered I had more studying to do than was humanly possible.
 Still, Mrs. Campbell had always been super nice, if equally stern, and there was only ten more minutes of class left.
 Besides, I'd been so intrigued by the sight of Alec drawing that I wanted to see him like that again.

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù Dieredon asked.
 She shrugged.
 ‚ÄúMy guess is his brother.

 Dieredon nodded.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôll find him and watch him for a bit.
 If either of them slaughters another child, I will see it and put an end to it.‚Äù
 Aurelia pulled a few strands of hair away from her mouth and tucked them behind her ear.
 ‚ÄúThis seems like a small matter for a scoutmaster to be involved.
 Are you sure you have nothing more important to do?‚Äù

92m likely0m. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôll be leaving with him later today and watch to see if he goes92m and0m if92m he0m kills another child. I can feel the ache92m in0m his92m cheek0m and see the doubt in his mind. Any person that he slaughters.‚Äù She smiled.

‚ÄúA sign,‚Äù Jason muttered and snapped his fingers.
 ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it!
 Jazell likes to leave clues, check the arrow.‚Äù Emily turned the arrow and saw a sloppy line drawn through two squiggly circles.
 She squinted closer and saw that Jazell had tried to make the line some sort of sword but epically failed.
 Emily showed Jason and he nodded.
 ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I thought.
 Now we have to figure out what it means.‚Äù Emily walked up to the edge of the hole and looked down.
 ‚ÄúI have a feeling that we have to go down there.‚Äù Jason sighed.
 ‚ÄúI guess we‚Äôre jumping down.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy would we do that?‚Äù ‚ÄúBecause,‚Äù he said and sat on the side, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have a rope.‚Äù Then he jumped.

She laid her hands on his chest, leaning into him as she looked up at him.
 "I really did want to kiss you.
 I couldn't have gotten that look on my face if I hadn't wanted to kiss you."
 He drew her closer.
 "Prove it."
 "How?"
 "Kiss me."
 She blushed, but after a moment, she stood on tiptoe and raised her face to press her lips against his.
 She wasn't sure how to begin a kiss, but that obviously wasn't going to be a problem: his lips began moving over hers the moment that they touched.
 When Rick released her, she gazed up at him anxiously.

Harruq‚Äôs hands opened and closed as he imagined his swords within them, ready to butcher for blood while the soldier proceeded to say the word ‚Äòwest‚Äô as long and drawn out as possible.
 ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù he mumbled and hurried off.
 Accompanied by a young man scribbling on a sheet of parchment, Alvrik sat at a small table in front of a group of people waiting in line to address him.
 Harruq slipped into the back and tried to calm down.
 Never before had he done anything like this.
 He had stolen food, fled from guards, lived in poverty, and kept to himself.
 For he and his brother, that was life.
 What the abyss was he doing asking for work?
 A swelling of nerves in his gut almost forced him to leave.
 Several men in front of him turned away, dejected or angry.

Silently Rick took her hand and led her downstairs.
 In the garden, he took her face between his hands, kissing her softly.
 "If you get home, I'll miss you."
 "I'll miss you too," she whispered, hugging him.
 She made herself focus her mind on her parents as she wandered through the garden.
 She missed talking to her mother.
 She knew her mother would understand about Davis.
 All she wanted was for Marie to be happy.
 She'd always been nice to Davis, but she'd never treated him like a son.

One covered in pictures that were eerily familiar, all with a circular signature at the bottom right hand corner.
 They were mostly of mundane kinds of things, landscapes, or people, but there were overtones that caressed a hidden chord inside my soul.
 Everything was done in drab, painfully boring colors, overlaid with incredibly vibrant, hues that were almost unreal in their perfection.
 It wasn't until I'd moved around a corner and entered what looked like a new phase for the painter that I figured out why the paintings looked so familiar despite the fact that I'd never seen any of the places or people depicted.
 The realization hit with such force that it distracted me from the familiarity of the signature.
 The new pieces were all breathtaking.
 The drab colors were gone, leaving scenes made up of multi-hued strands of light.
 It was like waking up and having someone tell you they'd been reading your mind.
 The pieces weren't of specific places or events from my dreams, but they were an exact match for how they'd looked and felt.
 I felt my hands start to shake.

She linked her arms around his neck, smiling into his eyes and then raising her face to kiss him.
 His hands wandered over her back as he returned her kiss.
 "Wow," he murmured, resting his forehead against hers.
 "I predict our house is soon going to be full of all kinds of knickknacks and gadgets."
 Smiling, she pulled him closer for another kiss.
 He was constantly thinking of her, buying her gifts and designing adventures for her.
 Sighing, she leaned into him as their kiss went on.
 Rick was lost.
 She held nothing back in her kiss, making him hungrier for more.

The only possible way to manage these innate aggressive forces is to meet them firmly.
 The international community has already shown, in the case of airline hijacking, that it is capable of effective action on a global scale when the necessary political will and commitment are forthcoming.
 By concerted measures, the rapid proliferation of hijackings has been virtually eliminated.
 Similar results can be achieved today drastically to curtail small arms proliferation and the drugs trade.
 The anti-social forces supporting these activities must be handled with the same firmness and determination applied to hijackers, regardless of whether they are governments, military, criminal or terrorist groups, corporations or banks.
 The power of these measures lies not in the enactment of laws but in their enforcement.
 Enforcement should be made mandatory and automatic.
 At the same time, it must be recognized that force alone can never eliminate these problems at their roots.
 Aggressive energies must be given constructive channels through which to express themselves positively in economic development.
 Unless and until famine and poverty are eliminated, both in developing countries and in the inner cities of the North, these energies will continue to find negative expression through violence.

It didn't really matter though.
 Cell phone or not, the biggest part of me was already floating away to somewhere safe.
 "I'll call Alec; he'll know what to do."
 She was still whispering, but the words sheared through the darkness, arresting my fall.
 I didn't want him here, didn't want to give him another reason to despise me.
 What if Jasmin came with him?
 The thought of lying helpless with her in the same room sent shivers of cold sliding down me.
 I couldn't see, so I reached out, blindly trying to find the phone before Rachel could dial Alec.
 My questing hand finally found the tiny, hard-plastic package, and I grabbed on with all of my fading strength.
 The darkness was still beckoning, but alternating images of Jasmin and Alec flashed before my eyes.

It jerked and coiled free of the wound, flicking blood over the tracker‚Äôs pristine white robe.
 Behind me, a low voice ordered, ‚ÄúKill him.‚Äù I glanced down at the sword, still in my hand.
 The sword I was supposed to take someone‚Äôs head off with.
 I didn‚Äôt know who the order had been intended for, but it wasn‚Äôt me.
 This man was going to die.
 I knew he didn‚Äôt have more than a moment before their magic broke him.
 They would take his life because he was after us.
 After me.
 I didn‚Äôt hesitate, just pulled my arm up and swung hard, backhand.
 The blade cut clean and his head rolled backward, hitting the ground with a sickening thud.

The faery and dwarves looked at her in surprise.
 I guess they‚Äôve never seen a teenage half-ling girl fall out of a bush before.
 ‚ÄúAm I interrupting something?‚Äù Emily asked with a gulp.
 The faery men drew their double swords and charged at her.
 I released an arrow and it buried itself in one of their necks.
 It fell backward and they turned to my hiding spot, searching for me.
 Two knives flew and a dwarf and man collapsed on the ground.
 I saw Jason hide behind his tree again.
 One dwarf got too close to Emily and she raised her arms, dousing him in flames.

My mother had tried to warn me, but I wanted and needed to know for myself.

 His arms, his chest, his face: it all bled.
 But he remained alive, at least until that final moment when the two magic blades scissor-cut his neck.

But really, I can shoot a bow with skill.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan and Imeralda looked at him doubtfully.
 ‚ÄúThe challenge,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan, ‚Äúis not to be simply good but to be able to outshoot over one hundred other highly skilled warriors, and the targets are multiple and difficult including a moving target.
 Unfortunately, all the targets are within normal range for a human, your strength will not help.
 The good news is this is a competition of skill and they provide the bows.
 The bad news is that it is up to each competing squire to have his own equipment for the other three competitions.
 The sword and the shield competition are limited to light armor.
 You will be at a disadvantage.
 The real problem is going to the completion with the lance and the mace.

It was almost convincing.
 If he hadn't mentioned the stairs, and thereby the fight, I might have fallen for it, but he was just looking for more attention.
 "I'll be okay.

 Alec looked like he wanted to say something else, but finally nodded and sat down in the next chair over.
 It wasn't as good as if he'd gone all the way back to his seat, and it was extremely out of character, but it was better than nothing.
 I breathed a sigh of relief that he wasn't going to continue fishing for compliments, and returned to my drawing.
 I knew I should open my books back up and study, but it was starting to take shape, and I figured it was only a few minutes away from becoming recognizable.
 Once that happened my meager drawing skills would evaporate and I'd have to stop anyways.

"Should I let it grow longer?"

 She sat down and poured milk on her cereal.
 "Mmm--this is delicious."
 "Good.

There are no free markets.
 The free market system is highly regulated and controlled by the very state over which it claims victory.
 But although in reality both systems are dead, the ideology of the capitalist system lives on and casts an illusory impression of supremacy.
 Rather than searching for a victor and vanquished, the urgent need is to find a successor that combines and synthesizes the enlightened values of both systems ‚Äì freedom and equality, liberty and security.
 It has been amply proved that the authoritarian state is incapable of exerting a benevolent authority over the people without imposing severe restrictions on freedom, stifling human energy and creativity, leading sooner or later to rising discontent and a loss of social vitality.
 It is also abundantly clear that money as an institution operating through the free pricing mechanism of the market system ‚Äì although it does succeed in generating high levels of energy, creativity and productivity ‚Äì regards people as a purchasable commodity or a potential market, but is otherwise indifferent to human values and welfare.
 Neither the determinism of the state nor the determinism of the market can be adequate in themselves to achieve the goals of peace and prosperity that we strive after.
 It has been generally assumed that the transition now taking place in Eastern Europe will sooner or later lead these countries to adopt forms of government and economy identical to those prevalent in the West.
 But for those raised in a society that offered a great measure of social security, the poverty and insecurity of the Western system are gross inadequacies.
 While it is clear that these new democracies have rejected the authoritarian statist system, it is not yet clear what finally they will accept, discover or invent as a more acceptable alternative.

Eric was the fastest middle-distance runner in our school.
 Baseball was my best game.
 But Eric and I had alienated some coaches.
 Me for quitting the baseball and football teams, soon after my dad died, so I could go instead to Singing Hills, a country club where Tommy Rupnik, a golf pro and friend of my dad‚Äôs let me play for free.
 Most every day, I traipsed through the woods alongside a stream and clobbered golf balls.
 Eric had angered coaches for walking away from the wrestling team after he lost a match and Coach Feezer belittled him.
 The coaches believed Eric had quit out of wounded pride.
 The truth was, disappointing people wracked him with shame.

I was so happy I forgot how arrogant he was, and I smiled at him as he sat down.
 It was like he was looking at something that wasn't even human.
 My insides seemed to freeze and shrink.
 I couldn't even muster up my normal blush of embarrassment.
 I'd had plenty of people hate me since I'd arrived in Sanctuary, but he was the first person I'd met who I was convinced wouldn't have thrown me a life preserver if I was drowning.
 It wasn't even because saving me would be too much work.
 He was completely convinced the world would be a better place without me.
 I'd never been so unnerved in my life.

I lit a thin flame to practice fire magic, leaning forward as I danced it back and forth above the ground.
 My control had progressed a good deal since my training had begun; it seemed almost easy to navigate a small flame.
 I smoothed it out into a line and traced arcs and then more intricate designs.
 The designs started to resemble portraits and I had to concentrate hard to keep from seeing them, so I focused on landscapes, but those grew from tiny village houses and trees to rolling hills and curving creeks.
 Before long, the hills rose to mountains that melted into unidentifiable monsters.
 I snuffed the flame with a wave and the den was black with night.
 Eventually, the clouds broke and the soft glow of moonlight filtered in through the opening.
 I leaned onto an elbow to examine the glistening patches of light on the skin of my outstretched hand, twisting it from day to night, pale to dark.
 Weary and trancelike, I lowered my head, tucking my arm back as a pillow, and fell into a deep sleep.

"This is Principal Gossil and I've got an exciting announcement.
 The school is sponsoring a trip to Las Vegas to see the production of Les Mis√©rables that just started.
 Tickets are available at a discounted rate in the office for the next two days."
 It was like someone had rifled through my mind to pick out my biggest disappointment in recent days, pulled it out and rubbed salt on the wound before cramming it back inside me.
 Of course I'd go see how big of a discount the school had gotten the tickets at, but it was extremely unlikely my tiny check would end up being enough.
 It took me a moment to realize Mr. Gossil hadn't ended his announcement.
 "...those wishing to be entered into the drawing should stop by the office between today and noon tomorrow."
 In the face of the near-universal apathy expressed by the rest of the student body, it took my mind several seconds to process exactly what had been said.
 I grabbed Brandon's arm and shook it to get his attention.
 "Did he just say they were drawing for free tickets?"

I grabbed my math book, and met an equally morose Britney at her locker.
 There are only so many times one person can say something sucks, and expect the other person to agree with them.
 Britney quickly used up her allotment of complaints, and then subsided into silence as she led the way to an out-of-the-way corner of the old school.
 I'd noticed Britney liked to position herself so she was closest to the middle of the hall.
 Admittedly, dodging all the people trying to get into their lockers wasn't much fun, but I suspected her real motivation was a desire to ensure she could see and be seen, which was much more easily accomplished by relegating me to the outside position.
 Normally I'd have just viewed her theatrics with amusement, but it'd been a long day and I wasn't in the mood.
 If I'd known for sure where we were heading, I'd have considered cutting her off, even with all of the probable fallout, but I didn't.
 Instead I just sighed, followed her around a corner, and collided with six-plus feet of muscled goodness packaged in a white polo shirt that looked worryingly familiar.
 Brandon caught me as I rebounded from him, easily stopping my momentum before I could stumble into a locker.
 "We'd better be careful; I'm starting to sense a trend."

"You knew all this time?"
 Another laugh, and a smile at the way I was trying to conceal how much the punch had hurt my hand.
 "Of course I knew.
 It isn't like I could do anything about that.
 I've never led her on, but I've always been aware she liked me."
 There didn't seem to be much else to be said, so I thanked Brandon again for the ride into school, and headed off to my home room.
 Everyone had pretty much just pretended like I didn't exist before.
 Now, with Brandon having taken an interest in me, I got everything from simple acknowledgment of my presence to obvious dislike, and even a couple of people who looked like they wanted to take Britney's place.
 I suppose some people would have been thrilled by the chance to join the top of the social food chain, but it mostly just disgusted me.
 I politely rebuffed the scavengers, ignored the haters, and carefully acknowledged the rest without giving them anything else to go on.

 With a sharp tearing sound, Alec's right hand elongated into the viciously clawed weapon of his hybrid form.
 It shredded the comforter and mattress just a few inches from my head.
 I gave him my best lop-sided smile and kissed his arm.
 "You're not going to scare me off with cheap tricks.

‚ÄúWell, let‚Äôs get to it then,‚Äù she said, leading me through the tiny living area toward the back room.
 She didn‚Äôt have or need a great deal of space.
 Much like me, Junnie was practically alone.
 Her family had all received the calling ‚Äúto serve elfkind.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know exactly what that meant, only that the elf usually left with fanfare and seldom returned in fewer than a hundred years.
 It was apparently a very honorable thing, though she never seemed proud.
 Just off the living area was the study, larger than the front room, stuffed full of documents and lit by a pair of dim oil lanterns.
 Dust covered the decrepit scrolls and books lining the walls, but aside from a well-used worktable, the room was clean.
 Settling onto my usual stool, I leaned forward, elbows on the carved edge of the table to prop my head up for the monotonous hours to come.
 It was hard to say how long I sat so, looking down on a huge volume entitled The Great Elves of Varkenshire, pretending to read.
 But my eyes had wandered from the page to a small thistle where it rested among some other potion ingredients.

Not in her looks.
 She was taller and red haired.
 But in her expression, I read the same message I got from Karen‚Äôs sweet face.
 It said, I‚Äôve been hurt bad and know how it feels so I‚Äôll be nice to everybody and try not to make anybody else feel that way.
 A thousand and some miles from home, I was lonely enough to once again ache for a best friend.
 So while I admired this barmaid, who looked about three months pregnant, I dreamed she and I would roam until we discovered the right small town, where we didn‚Äôt know anybody.
 There she could leave behind the sorrow of getting ditched by the creep who knocked her up.
 I meant to love her baby like my own.
 But on the third evening, not long after she had sat with me and chatted in a dovelike voice about strange and outrageous visitors to the bar, a guy with several tattoos came for her.
 As she walked out with him, she waved goodbye to me.

"I knew you'd be sitting here worrying she wouldn't come."
 It took a minute for the words to make sense.
 "Fine, but that doesn't shed any light on why you're all the way out here."
 The gray eyes just visible in the slowly growing light crinkled up in a smile.
 "I called her and told her I'd pick you up.
 She can take you home, I'll come pick you up every morning."
 My head was spinning.
 Why would the most popular boy in school want to pick me up for school every morning?

I sought refuge in something even more mundane.
 Namely the fact that tomorrow I would have to go enroll in school and try to blend in with a bunch of small-town juniors who'd all probably known each other since they could walk.
 Going to a new school after missing the first month of classes was a prospect likely to generate anxiety in the most outgoing of teenagers, and I was far from that, but it was a different kind of worry.
 As I mapped out all of the things that could, and probably would, go wrong, I could feel my heart slowly settle back down out of my throat.
 If I were pretty or athletic I'd probably manage to fit right in.
 It always seemed like the kids who moved in partway through the year usually had some kind of instant in with the cool crowd, but that probably wouldn't happen for me.
 It wasn't that I didn't want to make friends; I just wasn't very good at it.
 My equilibrium seemed to have returned, so I took a few unsteady steps around to the back of the truck.

Chapter Seven Steed
 The early morning sun streaked through every break in the makeshift door, lighting the entirety of the hollow.
 I considered covering my head with that damp dress and sleeping the rest of the day, but my stomach ached for food and Chevelle might not be far behind.
 I crawled out, rubbing and squinting my eyes, and was able to locate a few roots and greens.
 It would have to be enough to tide me over until I could figure out a way to hunt.
 After knocking the brush away from my shelter, I slung the pack over my shoulder and trudged north once more.
 There was an abundance of streams running through the hills, and a few patches of fat, amethyst berries along the way, so I couldn‚Äôt complain.
 And the route was undemanding; the ground was smooth, nothing too overgrown to make passage difficult, none of those nasty snarls that could form from a maze of thorn trees or the network of vines that could tangle your legs.
 The grass was tall, but soft, so it rolled over, hiding no more than the occasional field mouse or vole.
 Sporadic wildflowers dotted the hills, small sprays of pinks or spiky yellowbird.

Employment in manufacturing and mining grew to a peak of about 40 per cent of the workforce after World War II before beginning its downward spiral to 15 per cent by 2000, about the same proportion as in 1850.
 Yet, during this same period total employment in America has expanded phenomenally, from a mere 13 million workers in 1870 to 68 million in 1955 and more than 136 million in 2002.
 In spite of all the automation and all the export of jobs to lower wage economies, the percentage of the American population employed has continued to rise over time.
 Several factors are responsible for this result, among which population growth and technological development are most prominent.
 Rising levels of technological sophistication certainly displace workers in most fields of manufacturing.
 But at the same time they stimulate growth of employment in many different ways ‚Äì increasing demand for the products thus manufactured by a factor of 10, 100 or even 1000 fold as in the case of automobiles, TVs, cell phones and computers; increasing the demand for research workers to support technological innovation and for teachers to meet the rising demand for education; and rising living standards, which increases consumption of other goods and services due to the falling prices made possible by rising productivity.
 Over the past two decades the US economy lost nearly 4 million manufacturing jobs but added a net 37 million jobs through expansion of the service sector, which now accounts for 84 per cent of total employment.
 It is time that we stop resisting or resenting this trend, but rather strive to adapt by shifting our focus toward those fields of employment which are most directly stimulated by technological innovation.
 Export of commercial services already accounts for 20 per cent of world trade.
 The shift from manufacturing to services is a positive and inevitable expression of the elevation of human activity from the physical to the mental level, which is the central reason for the phenomenal rise in global living standards over the past century.

The Secret
 I could use Olga‚Äôs comment that a family or business person might need a bigger house to justify my bigger house.
 I have a daughter and a business, the college.
 Or two businesses.
 Agents, publishers and others encourage us writers to consider our work a business.
 Like Brother Lawrence, Olga didn‚Äôt urge anybody to retire to a monastery, only to try to stay in as close contact to God as they could in their own place and position.
 Besides Eric and Olga, Mother Teresa has taught me plenty.
 Judith Moore, a wise and benevolent editor at the San Diego Reader, sent me to Tijuana to report on the Missionaries of Charity seminary there.
 I spent a few glorious days talking to the brothers.
 I found them the kindest, most generous, least self-concerned group I have ever encountered.

Our lecture essentially consisted of an extended review, which I quickly realized I didn't need.
 I broke out my book and started in on one of my catch-up assignments instead.
 At the rate I was going I'd be able to take my makeup exam way ahead of schedule.
 It was a pretty lame thing to be excited about, but just having something going well for a change helped compensate for the rest of my life.
 Amazingly enough, the satisfaction from having accomplished so much shielded me for most of the rest of the day.
 I withstood Britney's varied, mostly unsubtle, attempts to make me feel guilty for not spilling my guts about whatever big secret she thought I had, and even held up through the complete boredom that was Mr. Simms' class.
 It wasn't until I walked into Physics that I felt the cold hand of reality reach out and caress the back of my neck.
 Alec was uncharacteristically early, already sitting at his normal desk.
 He looked up and briefly met my eyes when I reached my desk, but there wasn't even a trace of acknowledgment in his gaze.
 Mrs. Alexander started class, reviewed a couple of points that other groups needed clarified, and then released us to work on our assignments.

Instead, he'd skipped the entire first half of the week, and by the time I did finally see him, I'd backed myself so far into a corner, I couldn't even meet his eyes during class.
 Somehow I'd managed to make it through day after day of isolation.
 Brandon's friends continued to more or less ignore me, the boys without the trace of spite that I picked up from most of the girls.
 Britney started another rumor sometime about the middle of the week.
 Apparently I was now some kind of closet drug addict who was hoping to get Brandon to fund my habit.
 Rachel hadn't been back to tutoring since we'd argued, and I was picking up an increasing number of hostile looks from people I didn't even know.
 Some of them were recognizable as Alec's friends, but most of them were just nameless nerds who apparently had a soft spot for Rachel, or a towering hatred for Brandon's friends.

I'm not the only one who needs to sleep."
 I tried not to let my voice get too sing-song, but I felt a completely irrational thrill as he quietly crossed over to my side of the room.
 "That's actually one of the benefits of my condition.
 I don't actually need normal amounts of sleep.
 An hour or two per night is usually more than enough."
 Having him so close to me was somehow both exhilarating and soothing at the same time.
 I could feel the tense, knotty parts of me start to relax for the first time since Simon and Nathanial tried to kill me.
 As exhaustion started to finally eat through all of the nervous energy that'd been fueling me, it was all I could do to follow what Alec was saying.
 Still, I wasn't ready to go to sleep.
 It felt like he'd disappear if I closed my eyes.

They tell me it is great to talk to someone who understands what they are experiencing as a parent.
 Most have no one who can relate so they keep their family secret and they try to figure out what to do just as we did.

What is needed is a massive effort in public education and demonstration, coupled with incentives to encourage their adoption.
 In monsoon regions it has been demonstrated that recharging underground aquifers by reverse pumping during rain-surplus seasons can restore ten years of water depletion in one rainy season.
 Proven methods are available and have been commercially applied with great success, as the achievements of Israel so dramatically demonstrate, radically to reduce water consumption by as much as five- to ten-fold, while at the same time significantly increasing crop yields.
 The most productive of these methods, involving the construction of greenhouses, is too capital-intensive for immediate wide spread adoption in developing countries.
 Drip and sprinkler irrigation are far more moderate in cost and still result in enormous savings of water.
 The cost of adopting these methods can be further reduced by more widely popularizing them, so as to achieve increasing economies of scale in their manufacture.
 8.Low-input sustainable agriculture.
 While we have argued against pressure on food-deficit developing countries to reduce their comparatively low-level usage of mineral fertilizers and chemical pesticides, empirical studies sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences and the Department of Agriculture in the USA found strong evidence, long resisted by scientists and commercial farmers in the West, that chemical-free farming can be as productive and cost-effective as chemical-based methods.
 Industrial countries that offer subsidies to encourage chemical usage should modify their policies to provide active incentives for the use of chemical-free methods instead.
 During the last ten years, Indonesia has succeeded in bringing down the consumption of chemical pesticides without adversely affecting grain production through the nationwide adoption of integrated pest management systems for food crop protection.

Just before I looked back down at the shiny aluminum of my now-naked can, Brandon looked up and caught my eye.
 The smile on his face seemed to say all kinds of things.
 I'm sorry I can't come over and talk.
 They all really depend on me.
 This whole thing with Jasmin is really crazy; we've got to figure out how best to handle it.
 Maybe it really said all of those things, or maybe I was completely deluded, but it was definitely a smile.
 That alone was enough to make my heart skip a beat, and send a warm tingly feeling lapping through me like a wave of distilled happiness.
 I was halfway through History before I realized there'd been something odd about the discussion at Brandon's table.
 Luckily, Mr. Simms started out the class in usual form.

 Their cautious demeanor made more sense now.
 The council had sent trackers‚Äîthe pair Chevelle had choked and released, and the other, the broken, limp corpse in the clearing by the ridge.

It was not a matter of having enough; it was a matter of having almost too much power that overwhelmed the simple spell.
 Rodregas breathed in, trying to keep his mind empty but for the shape and vibration of the magic, as he fed a small amount into the bow.
 For a second he had it.
 The bow responded and Rodregas was able to pull the bow back, but the moment was quickly gone.
 The bow bounced back into its regular shape and his arrow shot up and floundered in the air before falling to earth.
 Where both Imeralda and Doi‚Äôvan had nailed the dead tree in the exact center, his arrow was closer to the barn then the target.
 Unfortunately, the barn was in the opposite direction.
 Rodregas heard a few unkind chuckles from the other two at his shot.

Now that I‚Äôve coached myself to talk to Jesus in Eric and Jesus in Olga, and God in Jesus, not only does it no longer feel neurotic or blasphemous.
 Instead, it seems just right.
 Because the more I do this, and I do it most every time I pray, the more Olga and Eric appear to fade, almost as if they become part of the sky, until all that‚Äôs left are their beautiful faces, and then I lose sight of the faces and all that remains are the attitudes those faces reveal, and what I perceive is willingness to sacrifice for me and others.
 Eric in his way, Olga in hers.
 Jesus in his.
 That I can‚Äôt see my best friends as clearly anymore tends to sadden me.
 But even the sadness contains beauty.

The inefficient and negligent use of water in agriculture is one of the most serious barriers to a sustainable expansion of agricultural production.
 Public policy regarding the cost of water supplied by major irrigation projects and low-cost or free distribution of power for pumping underground water aggravate the problem.
 Technologically, the solutions to water depletion are largely in hand.
 What is needed is a massive effort in public education and demonstration, coupled with incentives to encourage their adoption.
 In monsoon regions it has been demonstrated that recharging underground aquifers by reverse pumping during rain-surplus seasons can restore ten years of water depletion in one rainy season.

It is an indication of what is possible, not a prophecy or projection of what is inevitable.

 PROSPECTS FOR THE YEAR 2005
 According to the provisions of international treaty, the final batch of nuclear weapons has been destroyed, ushering in a world free of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
 Global military spending has fallen by nearly 50 per cent since 1994 to $400 billion per annum (in 1990 US dollars), half of which is now contributed to a global military force responsible for enforcing a total ban on war between nations.
 Not a single inter-state or civil war is raging due to the extension of the UN's mandate to prevent all forms of war and its vastly strengthened military capabilities.
 International drug trafficking has declined by more than 80 per cent since the signing of the UN declaration granting the UN special powers to eradicate the drugs trade.
 An accelerated schedule for dismantling trade barriers and the formation of regional economic unions, such as the Middle East Economic Area that incorporates Israel and the Arab states, and other initiatives to promote larger bilateral trade between countries and regions, have helped to more than double the growth rate in world trade.
 With the assistance of the UN's World Development Force, proposed in this report, food shortages have been eliminated from the last famine danger zones in Africa, and total food production on that continent has doubled within a decade.

 Instead, he silently handed her the bottle.
 Marie squeezed some lotion into her hand.

When we reached the blocked cave entrance, Seth drew his sword and sliced the vines apart.
 They fell to the ground and the cave was revealed.
 We walked inside the dimly lit space and I sighed in relief at some safety.
 The air smelled musty and I had a feeling no one had ever been here.
 I sat on the floor next to Emily and the boys sat on the opposite side of the floor.
 ‚ÄúWe should all get some rest,‚Äù Seth said with a yawn.
 ‚ÄúWe can figure out what to do next when we wake up.‚Äù I nodded sleepily and laid down on the hard ground.
 I closed my eyes, feeling a strange tiredness come over me.

Jessica is pretty much the most submissive, not by temperament, but because she's the weakest fighter we've got."
 I felt my eyes go wide at all the new terms, but kept my mouth shut because I was worried Rachel would clam up if I started asking questions.
 "I'm pretty sure Alec could take two of them, but not all three.
 They knew that, which was part of the reason they were pushing so hard."
 I felt shivers crawl up my spine, but what could someone say after something like that?
 Rachel reached over and gave me a hug.
 "Try not to think about it too much.
 Just remember that Alec's dominant to everyone here, and he'd die for either of us without even a heartbeat's worth of hesitation."

Then he slowly walked next to a great bull with bat wings and a head that appeared to be very human.
 While he had been drawn to the Chamber both figures repulsed him.
 They mocked the natural order.
 It was  not just that they seemed to combine multiple unconnected animals, but the size and shapes were simply wrong.
 Rodregas looked up from his examination of a strange bull daemon and looked for Doi‚Äôvan.
 He must have been more familiar with the powers of the various creatures.
 Doi‚Äôvan had walked past many of the figures until he stood at one toward the back.
 The shape was a powerfully built dragon with wings partially spread as if getting ready to fly.
 But unlike a real dragon this one had three heads at the end of long serpentine necks; one was that of a wolf, one was of an eagle and one was of a lion.

In twilight, Eric and I climbed up from the beach and explored some caves.
 After dark, we rested atop the cliff, in a little park a half mile from the Cabrillo lighthouse.

 I told him how Christmas was always my dad‚Äôs favorite day, how the only plants he ever grew were poinsettias he would deliver to the family graves every Christmas morning after the presents got exchanged and breakfast was over.
 When I finished, Eric paced again.
 Then he squatted in front of the bench where I sat and gazed hard at me, as though wondering how far I could be trusted.
 After deciding in my favor, he said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a big change coming.

I opened my eyes to find I was sitting on the ground next to my sleeping body.
 I saw Emily sitting there, saying nothing for once.
 Something fell off my back and I picked it up.
 It was a wooden bow, and when I reached behind my back I felt a quiver full of feathered arrows strapped there.
 I ran a finger over the smooth, dark wood and turned to see Seth crashing out of the woods.
 I smirked at him and pointed at his head.
 ‚ÄúYou have dark blue hair.‚Äù I giggled, not knowing why I was giggling after what had just happened to us a few minutes ago.

 She'd been a nice enough girl, but she'd had her own car at dinner, and it would have been totally ridiculous for him to offer to drive her home.
 According to Lauri, however, Beth would have accepted the offer and returned later to get her car, just for the chance to be alone with him.
 He was glad then that he hadn't offered.
 How could he respect a woman who would do something so silly?
 Restless now, Rick began wrapping up for the day.
 He‚Äôd been a junior vice president at Ward and Lee Realty since 2008, a position that involved a great deal of paperwork.
 Sometimes he missed spending the entire day visiting properties and dealing, but the behind-the-scenes work had its own challenges.

Mrs. McGonnigle.
 I think that‚Äôs right.
 Funny thing is, you know, she was kind of a fox.
 Too foxy to try and control a roomful of libidos.
 She dressed like a stewardess, I remember.
 Anyway, she took one look at this patch on my ass and drew in her breath as if I had a picture of a couple fucking on my jeans‚Äîshe literally turned white.
 And sent me to the office, with a note recommending my suspension.
 I laugh now, but, hell, I was a little frightened.
 I mean, I hated school, right?

The wind whipped at my hair, causing me to see the green strands in front of my eyes.
 The cold nipped at my cheeks and nose, which I tried to rub back to warmth.
 I stood at the edge of the cliff and gasped when I looked down.
 Underneath me, hundreds of monsters gathered around a fight.
 I couldn‚Äôt see who was fighting inside because a swamp troll blocked my view, but I knew it was brutal the way they whooped at a screech of pain.
 I wanted to close my eyes and look away, but I was so curious to see what was going on, that I couldn‚Äôt.
 The crowd parted to reveal the scariest and most hideous thing I‚Äôve ever seen.
 It must have been some type of faery because I could see long, pointed ears sticking up from the sides of its head.
 Long, black hair was stuck out in all directions on top of its head looking slimy and dirty.
 Sharp, twisted horns sat on top of its head, gleaming in the dark.

The climb took far longer than he hoped and he could not see Imeralda as he climbed.
 He was finally getting close to the first of the branches of the tree when he heard Doi‚Äôvan yell.
 ‚ÄúRodregas, what in the name of the Celestial Winds are you doing?‚Äù He paused in his climb, his toes caught in the bark.
 Rodregas could feel the wetness of blood on his toes and he felt like he was going to slip at any moment.
 He breathed deep and yelled, ‚ÄúI am climbing the damn ‚ÄòOne Tree,‚Äô what does it look like?
 Now, shut up before I fall.‚Äù  He continued his climb, finally reaching a branch.
 The branch was on such a scale that he had to climb the branch coming up its side.
 The bark of the branch was smoother and offered less of a grip.
 Finally he got to the top, which was broad and actually rather cup-like against the main trunk.
 Though he worried about Imeralda, he let himself rest for a moment to recover.

The announcer, heard by all who attended this rural school in the center of Hoisington, Kansas, called my father‚Äôs name, Richard T. DeHaven, and then my mother‚Äôs newly acquired married name, Karla June DeHaven.
 It echoed through the classrooms, with a collective gasp from students and teachers.
 They were excused from class, walked through the desks that lined the classroom, all eyes following them out the door.
 Their parents stood with the principal ready for their arrival at the office.
 As they entered the room it wasn‚Äôt hard to see the anger and disappointment.
 They were from different sides of this small town.
 My father‚Äôs dad was a butcher, his wife a seamstress.
 My mother‚Äôs dad was an oil rig grunt of American-Indian decent, and his wife, a meek submissive homemaker.
 Neither parent thought the other was good enough for their child, let alone the fact that they were both still children.

While his upper body was covered, nothing stopped the arrow from flying underneath and piercing through the metal greaves protecting his shins.
 Antonil stumbled, pain flaring up his right leg.
 He forced himself to continue running.
 If he could close the gap, the bow would prove no match for his longsword.
 Another arrow struck an inch from his left foot.
 His leg was aflame, yet he continued to charge, pulling back his shield so his sword could lash out.
 But the elf was not close enough, and he was more skilled with a bow than in just firing arrows.
 He snapped the wood up, cracking Antonil across the bottom of his hand, which held firm to his blade.
 Undaunted, the elf stepped closer, ducked underneath the guard captain‚Äôs return swing, and then kicked at the arrow still lodged in his shin, finally making Antonil drop his blade.
 The elf stood, drawing an arrow as he did.

‚ÄúNo Jazell not yet, maybe we can learn a little more from them.‚Äù Her voice was a hoarse whisper.

 ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she said a little more clearly.
 ‚ÄúWe have to wait and see what happens.
 Plus, we can‚Äôt just randomly attack them.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt really care.
 The song was repeating itself in my head, like a taunt.
 Without thinking, I aimed and shot the nearest dwarf.
 As soon as he went down, the whole camp was facing our direction.

Wow, talk about a chauvinistic pig.
 It wasn't worth getting bent out of shape.
 I let my door swing shut, and walked over to Rachel's side so that I could see the entire parking lot.
 Empty as it was, it didn't take very long to realize Britney's little white Saturn was gone.
 "I thought you might still be here."
 The voice caught me by surprise.
 I probably would've jumped and screamed a little if I hadn't recognized it.
 Brandon was walking towards us with his characteristic casual stride, and I felt my heart speed up a little as I remembered our conversation from earlier in the day.
 "Brandon!

Everyone in the pack already knew I'd spent the night.
 In the end, the reasonable part of me never had a chance.
 Waking up next to Alec fully vindicated my decision.
 He'd greeted me with his typical, heart-stopping smile and I'd leaned in to kiss him before I'd even realized I was in motion.
 He'd pulled back, but his expression at least wasn't reproachful.
 I wanted to force the issue, wanted it so badly I could feel the desire bubbling inside me, but even more than my natural shyness, the thought of him pulling away again, this time in disgust, was too much to contemplate.
 Once we got to school, I'd found the rampant gossip had subsided to a dull rumble, but the few undecided votes had come down solidly on the side of everyone else.
 Some people hated me for using Brandon, others hated me for playing Alec, while a small, but decidedly upwardly-mobile group disliked me for achieving not just one, but both of the conquests they'd been dreaming of since grade school.
 In the end, it didn't really matter why everyone disliked me.
 Still, only the fact that Alec's pack closed ranks around me kept the situation from becoming unbearable.

In order to meet the people‚Äôs nutritional requirements for fruit and vegetables, India‚Äôs production of these crops needs to double within the next decade.
 Achieving that high level will generate more than six million new jobs in the country.
 Broadening the scope to include other agricultural products, particularly textiles, the potential for accelerating global economic growth by an agriculture-led strategy is even greater.
 Cotton is a crop with a very high income and employment multiplier effect.
 Per capita cotton consumption in poorer developing countries such as India is less than half the level in China and less than a third the level in industrial nations.
 Measures of the gap between the prevailing levels of nutrition in developing countries and the levels achieved in the West reveal a huge potential for increasing demand for agricultural production, which can serve as an engine to drive the growth of the world economy.
 Extrapolation from ICPF‚Äôs studies of the employment potential of expanding agricultural production in India suggests that more than one billion jobs can be created worldwide through a strategy that focuses on raising agricultural productivity as an engine for improving diets, employment and industrialization.
 Challenges in Agriculture
 The ratio of growth of foodgrain production to population growth has entered into a period of decline over the past decade ‚Äì increasing at just one per cent per year compared to three per cent during the previous two decades.

He didn‚Äôt feel particularly attracted to her, but she was a nice girl, and that was a big improvement over his last few experiences.
 That evening he went out to the garden with the book Teri had given him.
 Sharon had been enthusiastic about the dance when he‚Äôd called to invite her.
 He‚Äôd told her he‚Äôd lend her the book, but she said that she already had some ideas about finding a drop-waist dress and a cloche hat.
 Personally, he thought the clothes were rather ugly.
 The dresses were shapeless, and the men‚Äôs pants were baggy.

That kind of makes sense if you can have greater sigils that are the shapes of the Celestial Beasts.
 Why not daemons of the Infernal Realm as well?
 But what is the One Tree?
 It is not a beast of a realm, it is the symbol of the Nymph people.
 It can‚Äôt be a sigil, can it?‚Äù she asked.
 Neither Doi‚Äôvan nor Rodregas answered and the three of them stood there, each caught up in their own thoughts.
 Finally, Doi‚Äôvan spoke, ‚ÄúI am going to see what lies in this Chamber.
 Will you be alright?‚Äù he asked Imeralda.
 She nodded and seemed relieved as she headed right for the doorway of the One Tree.

Qurrah took out his last healing potion, popped the cork, and then held it before him.
 Blood was beginning to fill his throat once more.
 His stolen energy was quickly fading.
 He had no time to waste.
 He tilted his head as high as the arrow in his neck allowed, positioned the mouth of the vial against his lower lip, and then closed his hand around the arrow shaft.

A feint, so quick Harruq blocked on instinct, took care of the other.
 His weapons gone, the half-orc was exposed.
 Dieredon wasted no time smashing the half-orc‚Äôs groin.
 As he doubled over in pain, a snap kick smacked his chin, splattering blood and forcing him to drop.
 The sharp tip of a blade pressed against Harruq‚Äôs throat before he knew what was happening.
 ‚ÄúMove,‚Äù Dieredon said.
 ‚ÄúPlease, move.
 Give me an excuse to kill you.‚Äù
 Harruq was too stunned and disoriented to give him what he wanted.
 Instead he lied there, his nose throbbing and his swords limp in his hands.

He recoiled as if struck.

 Even as they stood there, he watched several orcs go running past, howling murder.

So, like, I remember the whole Wattstax thing‚Äîit was all so casual in Memphis.

 No one understood what it all was gonna mean.

 Of course, this was while it was spinning out of control for me.
 Slowly spinning out of control, like I could chart it.

It was a dance.
 Rodregas had seen a few sword masters fight; and it was like this.
 The staff moved faster and with more control that one could follow.
 Doi‚Äôvan finished the exhibition with the staff swinging over his shoulder and with a savage swing downward, ending with perfect control where it would have connected with a fallen opponent.
 Rodregas almost pointed out that he was doing Kata, practicing against an opponent only seen in your mind, but decided that this was the time for him to learn and Doi‚Äôvan to teach.
 Rodregas had long ago learned that it was hard to learn if you were talking.
 Over the next hour Rodregas began to regret his decision to learn.
 Doi‚Äôvan was clearly a master with the staff which Rodregas could not help but be impressed by.
 In the Eastern Realms, and every other kingdom that he knew of, the staff was a peasant weapon.
 As many lords only allowed swords to be for their soldiers and nobility.

Many windows decorated the front, all covered with silken curtains.

But to give this woman he barely knew such fine armor and weapons was not something to do casually.
 It made a lot of sense sitting there on the foothills of the Arida Mountains, worrying about Gobelyn and Dire Cat attacks, but they were a great gift; no one had ever given him such a gift.
 ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù she asked me ‚ÄúYou are looking at me like I asked you for your first born child,‚Äù she stated in a surprised voice.

Davis smiled at her in the ugly, shapeless dress.
 "It's very pretty.
 But how could it not be, with you wearing it."
 She blushed, pleased with his compliment.
 Deciding that the dress would be perfect with the scarab-shaped gold and turquoise choker Davis had given her for her birthday, she went to try on two other dresses.
 But now she liked the Egyptian pattern so much that the others didn't appeal to her.
 Maybe she could find a similar motif in a different color at another shop.
 Changing back into her own dress and straightening the seams on her stockings, she emerged with the blue lotus on her arm.

Most of the rest of the matches were with squires with no ribbons.
 But as the afternoon wrapped up his final match was against Karun who had two second place white ribbons on her arm.
 Rodregas was pretty sure this match would decide who got the yellow first place ribbon and who would get the white.
 If Rodregas won it would give him ten total points after three competitions.
 It would give Karun twelve points if she once more came in second.
 If he lost, it would be much harder.
 Karun would have thirteen and he would have nine points.

So he then asked the question that he really wanted to ask, ‚ÄúDo you know if Imeralda is coming with us, or if she staying with you?‚Äù He should have asked her that himself during the last few days.

 He was afraid of what the answer might be.
 ‚ÄúDo you truly understand Imeralda‚Äôs dual nature?‚Äù asked Jordaan.
 ‚ÄúShe is a half Nymph.
 What does that have to do with her going or staying?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 ‚ÄúNothing, but it does if you love her.‚Äù Jordaan said with his big smile.
 His expression showed nothing but his normal cheer.

It concurred that rising levels of unemployment constituted a serious problem that needed to be urgently addressed, but rejected the notion that it is an inevitable and incurable disease which the world must resign itself to passively suffer and endure.
 The Commission, therefore, developed and presented a comprehensive strategy for job-led economic growth.
 Over the past decade, changes in the employment picture lend credence to ICPF‚Äôs perspective.
 The American economy experienced a decade-long expansion, fuelling high levels of employment at home, while stimulating job growth throughout East Asia, attracting a massive influx of foreign technical workers and setting the stage for a global outsourcing boom which is still in its infancy.
 Among the advanced economies, unemployment declined from an average of 6.9 per cent in the period 1985-94 to 6.5 per cent during the last 10 years.
 It fell by 10 per cent in France, 25 per cent in Italy, a third in Netherlands, 50 per cent in Spain and 70 per cent in Ireland.
 It is declining but remains 10 per cent higher than the average for 1985-94 in Germany, which is still recovering from the economic impact of reunification.
 The new market economies of Eastern Europe are growing rapidly.
 But these positive trends are no grounds for complacency.
 While they may dispel fears of an irreversible shrinkage of the job market in OECD countries, the proportion of long term unemployed remains at an unacceptably high 29 per cent of the total, indicating that these countries have not yet evolved successful strategies to address the issue.

Rodregas did not think he actually minded coming over to his room.
 Rodregas smiled and thought that given the way Doi‚Äôvan talked about pain when training them with the staff, that he must be immune to mere pain anyhow.
 Imeralda repeated Jordaan‚Äôs question.
 ‚ÄúJordaan asked Rodregas if you two were related as being Hellborn is very rare in the Eastern Realms.‚Äù And Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs surprised expression Imeralda added, ‚ÄúWhile I cannot sense the feel and make up of a body like I can a tree, I do know the feel of magic, and I had thought a few times that I sensed the feel of Brimstone and Fire not just with Doi‚Äôvan, but with both of you.‚Äù Rodregas could feel his eyes widen as Imeralda confirmed what Jordaan had felt.
 He had been thinking while Doi‚Äôvan was being fetched and he had a question for his friend.
 ‚ÄúDoi‚Äôvan, you were swept up quickly after you entered the Eastern Realms; you clearly have a strong physical essence and strong magical power.
 The Immortalists should not be interested in either.
 Which did they show interest in?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 ‚ÄúBoth really, I did not understand why they wanted me.
 I thought if you were Hellborn you were safe from the Immortalists,‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan replied, ‚ÄúThey would cut me to see how fast I would heal and do tests where they were clearly testing my physical side.

Debt reduction should be linked to each country's specific programmes for poverty eradication and meeting the minimum needs of the people.
 7.Commodity prices: The problem of debt is closely linked to that of international commodity prices.
 The majority of developing countries are dependent on the export of primary products for their welfare and growth.
 These products account for 80‚Äì90 per cent of the exports of African countries, and 65 per cent in the case of Latin American nations.
 The extreme price volatility of commodity markets is especially damaging to low-income countries, which, regardless of the price, are forced to sell their products to meet minimum needs and pay debts.
 The obligation of the poorest developing countries to repay debts forces them to produce and export excessive quantities of basic commodities, which has been a principal cause of falling commodity prices.
 The more these countries export, the faster prices fall, making it impossible to generate sufficient funds for debt repayment by this means, which is often the only source of foreign exchange available to them.
 Distress sales by the poorest countries force even financially stronger countries to drop their prices in order to maintain market share, which encourages buyers to postpone purchases in expectation of still-lower prices.
 The growth of agricultural incomes in developing countries is critically important to global job creation and economic growth.
 The expansion of agricultural exports under the new GATT agreement is likely to exacerbate the falling commodity price syndrome to the great detriment of the entire world economy, unless effective mechanisms are introduced to stabilize international commodity prices.

 He stood tall and handsome, young squires surrounding him ready to serve.
 Rodregas thought that the Immortalist was watching him.
 He would have to leave quickly after the tournament, as the man was growing suspicious of them.
 Rodregas would have loved to kill him, but Van‚Äôdret was a powerful sorcerer capable of magic that made him nearly impossible to kill.

‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù she answered.
 I reached up to feel my own ears as I considered hers.
 I had always hidden mine behind hair, never braiding it back or putting it up to expose them.
 Not that I could have pulled off the intricate braiding and designs of the other elves.
 But my ears were clearly more rounded than everyone else‚Äôs, almost blunt.
 Ruby‚Äôs were different, too.
 Hers were more angular though, long and almost pointed at the tip.
 Neither of us matched the norm.
 Hers were one extreme, mine the other.

Thursday morning flew by, it was like I blinked and it was already time for Mrs. Campbell's class.
 A number of the other girls, and even a couple of the guys, stopped by my desk before the bell rang to congratulate me on winning the last ticket to Les Mis√©rables.
 Britney wasn't one of them.
 I caught her glaring at me a couple of times out of the corner of my eye.
 Under normal circumstances I probably would've felt guilty, or at least wished things had worked out differently.
 Today, I was fully prepared to acknowledge Britney as the spoiled, self-centered brat she was.
 The bell rang and then Mrs. Campbell's lecture was over in record time.
 I even finished my assignment a good ten minutes before class was scheduled to end.
 I was absently sketching what I expected the inside of the opera house to look like, when a tap on my shoulder pulled me out of my reverie.
 "I'm so sorry, Mrs. Campbell.

"So are you going to tell me what the differences are, or is that part of the stuff I'm not allowed to know?"
 Alec's chuckle was muffled by the closed door, but still brought a smile to my face.

 Everything else is just kind of a corollary to that.
 At least one pack member will need to be with you whenever you leave the house."
 I spit out the toothpaste currently prohibiting me from being able to respond, and swung the door open.
 "Alec, it's the middle of the semester.
 We can't just walk into the office and tell them we want to change our schedules.
 It doesn't work that way."

The metaphysical hurricane that'd knocked me to the ground had actually been Alec pulling power from all of the shape shifters and humans in the area.
 The experience had been nearly as overwhelming for Alec as it had been for the rest of us.
 He'd recovered just in time to find Brandon grimly pulling himself along on all fours.
 Luckily Alec had recovered more quickly, and once Brandon was deprived of the strength and speed¬†his¬†power had bestowed upon him, Alec had been more than a match for him, even wounded and exhausted.
 Brandon's end had been quick, and if Alec hadn't realized my blood was slowly leaking out onto the ground, the rest of Brandon's pack would've likewise been quickly sorted out.
 Instead, Alec had stumbled over, shifted back to human form, and got the bleeding slowed to a point where I wasn't in imminent danger of death.
 Unfortunately that'd been all the delay Brandon's pack had needed to make a run for it.
 Isaac, James and Jasmin were trying to track down the worst of the lot, the ones who'd taken an active part in Brandon's atrocities, but it was slow going.
 Part of the job had been resolved when Cassie and two other wolves had tried to circle around and attack the estate.
 Luckily Isaac and the others had stumbled onto them.

So once you're done, I get to ask you any question?
 No restrictions?
 That was nearly a deal breaker, I could see it by the way his initial smile at my 'rolled eyes' faded away into his more characteristic seriousness.
 He contemplated his response for a good fifteen seconds, which was probably something like two hours in shape shifter time, before finally touching his pen to the paper again and then passing my notebook back.
 It's a deal.
 When I finish up with my questions, you can ask whatever you want.
 Of course if your question is something that's going to get you into trouble, I reserve the right to pack you onto a plane and send you off to safety once I'm done answering.

Chevelle stood.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trying too hard, Freya.
 Let us play a game.‚Äù He held out his hand and a stone flew up from the ground to land in the center of his open palm.
 He closed his fist around it and when he opened it a moment later, the stone was floating a half inch above his palm, slick black and shaped to form a tiny hawk sculpture.
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs beautiful,‚Äù I said, moving to touch it.
 He held up his other hand up to stop me.
 ‚ÄúTake it.‚Äù I wanted to hold the trinket; I reached forward and concentrated on moving it from his palm to mine.
 It floated shakily across the space between us, which seemed so odd at first I thought Chevelle must have moved it.
 I squeezed my fingers around it, as if to verify it was real, but when I opened my hand again it was only the dull gray rock.
 Disappointment filled my face as I looked back at him.

The three of us escaped around the office building, down the front steps to the street, where we ran into Laura.
 Though in four years she would become my wife, I hardly knew her and didn‚Äôt realize yesterday was her birthday.
 She asked me to sit on the grass for a minute.
 Staring across the ball fields, she said, ‚ÄúJust last week he promised that for my birthday he was going to give me a very special present, only I wouldn‚Äôt understand it for a long, long time.
 So he goes and gets killed on my birthday.
 What‚Äôs that mean?‚Äù I shrugged.
 We hugged stiffly.
 Then we parted and went our own ways.

Well, if there were televisions in 1927, he would.

He scowled at the cigar between his fingers, pained as always by the thought of his son.
 John had refused to let his father groom him for his company and had instead started a rival company.
 There was no real rivalry--John's company was too small and had too little capital--but the betrayal still hurt Jefferson deeply.
 "My only son turned his back on me," he continued, "leaving me in need of an heir.
 You have the stuff it takes to run a business, Davis.
 And I believe in keeping the business in the family, so when I made you vice president, it was with the assumption that I'd be grooming a son-in-law as well as the future president of the company."
 He rose, extending his hand.
 "You most certainly have my blessing, my boy.

 Chevelle caught my arm and righted me on my now-still horse.

 I was cautious after that but it became easier to control his movement as we rode.
 I practiced guiding him, eventually even maneuvering him back and forth between the misshapen rocks and spiky brush on our way.
 I was still afraid to have him kneel when we stopped for the evening, though, imagining him rolling on top of me if I tried.

Advocates of private enterprise contrast the failures of Eastern European agriculture with the achievements of the industrial nations as ample evidence of the free market‚Äôs superior capacity to achieve high levels of agricultural productivity.
 Recently, international and bilateral financial institutions have promoted the market as the most effective instrument for managing agriculture throughout the world.
 This view leaves two questions unanswered.
 First, if the market is so effective, why is it that every major capitalist economy utilizes such a vast array of subsidies, incentives, controls, production quotas and fixed pricing mechanisms to govern production and trade in agricultural products?
 Even after GATT, protection for this sector by industrial nations will remain high.
 Second, granted that the market works effectively for mature capitalist societies with high levels of technology, education, productivity, living standards and food surpluses, and relatively small portions of the workforce dependent on agriculture, is the same necessarily true for countries at an earlier stage of development, in which (1) a majority of the workforce is dependent on agriculture for sustenance, (2) levels of education, productivity and incomes are low, and (3) any increase in food prices can have a devastating impact on food consumption levels in the country?
 The answers to these questions are relevant both to the countries presently making the transition from centrally planned to market economies in Eastern Europe and to poorer developing countries striving to achieve food security.
 Nations accord special status to their agricultural sector for several reasons.
 Continuous supplies of food are absolutely essential to the welfare of the population.
 Food prices are extremely sensitive to changes in the supply of foodstuffs.

Then I realized it was Emily.
 ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs alive and she‚Äôll wake up soon.
 Stop nagging me,‚Äù a different voice said that was obviously Seth‚Äôs.
 He was really close to me because I could feel his breath on my face and his voice was very loud.
 Which wasn‚Äôt helping my throbbing head at all.
 ‚ÄúBut when?
 I don‚Äôt like just staying here, when more monsters might come.

‚ÄúA hawk?‚Äù It seemed like an accusation, but I had no idea why.
 I sat, blank-faced, staring back at him, and he turned to Ruby to give her the strangest look.
 ‚ÄúA hawk?‚Äù She appeared abashed for a moment and then simply shrugged, smiling.
 ‚ÄúSeemed to fit.‚Äù That answered his accusation and he released my hand, easing back into his chair.
 ‚ÄúWell, now that you‚Äôre back‚Ä¶‚Äù She hopped off her own chair and bounded toward the door.

 ‚ÄúToo bad they can‚Äôt stay inside with us.

I can take care of the pain though."
 There was a reason I'd never had the slightest inclination to give blood, but fear of needles or not, I couldn't bring myself to protest, so I just shut my eyes and gripped Alec's hand as Donovan stuck the needle in several different locations.
 The blessed numbness quickly spread out to encompass my entire foot.
 Working with a sure quickness any surgeon would have envied, Donovan wrapped my ankle and then examined his handiwork with a nod of approval.
 "That should take care of the pain and immobilize it so it can begin healing, but it is vitally important that you don't put any weight on it, Mistress Paige."
 Alec gripped Donovan's shoulder in thanks, and then nodded as Donovan excused himself to go see to Jess.
 "We should go too.

Measured in these terms, even the most developed nations still have a long way to go and much that can be done to further the development of their people.
 To sum up, 10 years ago when we presented the report of the International Commission on Peace and Food, we were optimistic that humankind will grasp the uncommon opportunities provided by democratic systems of governance and technological and knowledge revolutions for achieving a world without hunger and where every individual has an opportunity for a productive and healthy life.
 The onward march of technology is still in full swing, but the political commitment to foster cooperative human security worldwide is yet to emerge.
 The Information Age has given meaning and content to the concept of a global village.
 The threats associated with climate change and biodiversity loss also underline the fact that while humankind may be segregated by political frontiers, our fates are intertwined ecologically.
 Economically also, islands of prosperity cannot co-exist forever in the midst of oceans of poverty.
 Both unsustainable lifestyles and unacceptable poverty must become features of the past, if we are to curb the growing violence in the human heart.
 Ten years after presentation of our report, we remain convinced that universal health, harmony and happiness are still within our reach, if only we imbibe the eternal truth contained in the following message of Lord Krishna delivered on the battlefield of life called Kurukshetra:
 We human beings can become whatever we sincerely aspire to become.
 Looking back, it is astonishing how much the world has changed since the idea of establishing the International Commission on Peace and Food was first conceived in 1987. Who had the foresight to imagine the monumental changes which have so radically altered the political, economic and social complexion of the world community ‚Äì the end of the nuclear arms race and the opposing military alliances of East and West, the rising tide of democracy that dramatically and irreversibly transformed the USSR and the countries of Eastern Europe, the growing importance of the UN in peace keeping and peace making, the peaceful end of apartheid in South Africa, the first tangible steps toward lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East, the completion of global trade negotiations and the founding of the World Trade Organization, and concerted actions to stem the degradation of the environment?

It will pass.‚Äù His words were gentle now, the anger gone.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I whispered.
 He didn‚Äôt respond.
 He leaned over me to straighten the bedding, his face close to mine.
 I stared at his mouth, wondering briefly what it might taste like.
 I felt a sharp pain and realized I was biting my lip.
 The thought made me giggle again, but Chevelle‚Äôs eyes shot to my face and all amusement ceased.
 He stroked my cheek lightly with the back of his hand.

Alec of course spent the whole class unearthing other little bits of embarrassing information.
 I'd never experienced anything like it, every question I answered spawned two more, and he invariably seemed to figure out the underlying reasons I'd done a given thing, or reacted a certain way.
 I'd just finished describing my failed tryout for the school's production of¬†To Kill a Mockingbird, when he hit me with a completely unexpected question.
 "So tell me about both your best date and your worst date before you came here."
 I felt my skin instantly heat up, and looked down, unable to meet his gaze.
 He let me sit there for a couple of seconds, and then reached out and used one gentle finger to nudge my chin up.
 "What's the matter, afraid I'll be jealous?"
 I shook my head, fighting the urge to look back down.
 "No, there isn't anything to be jealous of.
 I'd never been on a single date before Sanctuary, and you know all about what's happened since I arrived."

"Please, as if any girl who didn't know what a jerk Brandon was would've done anything different.

 There wasn't really any response to that.
 "So, what's going to happen now?

 Everyone seemed really worried last night."

Of course, by this time, I was making my own music, fixing to go out on my own, and, in a way, I saw Dylan as a map, as a way out into the world.
 What more can we ask of art, right?
 Later, when I met him, I talked to him about this and he was, well, flattered, I guess, and he talked about how Guthrie and Leadbelly were like that for him.
 All these memories collide in my head to form a capharnaum around what I want to know more concretely: how did Bob Dylan become important to me?
 And the process must have been gradual, an accretion, Bob Dylan never became, for me, what James Joyce was for Richard Ellmann, or to use a less pretentious comparison, what hamburgers were for Wimpy.
 A centering object, a holy thing.
 But he became a dream-figure, a part of my unconscious, as I understand the term.
 Is Bob Dylan more than a man?
 Is he more than a man with an extraordinary gift?
 Is he really something holy?

His sister.
 Rachel was Alec's sister, and he hadn't made a move to save her.
 He hadn't even been willing to let his friends step in and stop the fight.
 I drifted off to History thinking that I would've done almost anything to save my sister.
 It would take a real heartless individual to abandon their own family.
 My anger buffered me just enough to think about Cindi without the usual consequences, but I still wasn't really in top form.
 I was halfway through my class before I realized Mr. Simms had been shooting me dark looks for the last twenty minutes.
 They weren't the obvious nasty looks that kids shoot each other of course.
 They were subtle and infrequent but there was something about the set of his mouth that made it clear he wasn't pleased I was in his class.
 I shrugged it all off and gutted my way through class, eagerly planning what I'd say to Alec when I saw him in physics, only when I finally stalked into Mrs. Alexander's class Alec wasn't sitting in his corner desk.

 A rumbling commenced.
 At first I thought it was a landslide.
 A granite stone about three feet across came bounding and crashing toward us, gathering speed as it careened.
 We scrambled off the boulder and into the shelter of a grotto beside the trickling stream.
 Once we caught our breath, we crawled and peeked out from behind the rocks that formed the grotto‚Äôs walls.

The thought of walking into some apartment and getting clunked over the head for drugs is not an option.
 This is the second time Steve and Ashley are supposed to meet me for this buy, and the last time they decided not to show after I wasted hours listening to their phone calls buying more time or trying to get me to drive somewhere else.
 ‚ÄúI have no intention of moving anywhere, so get your shit together or this deal is off.‚Äù I tell her this is her last chance to get the Oxy and I will be waiting in the spot I told her.
 ‚ÄúHurry up, or I will sell the drugs to someone else, just like I did the last time you flaked!‚Äù I push the end call button on this cheap pre-paid cell phone that I purchased just to do this deal and I toss it onto the console of the truck.
 I didn‚Äôt want these drug dealers to know my real name or have my actual cell phone number.
 Steve and Ashley know my elder son, Brandon, and my second son, Bryce, but they do not know I am their father or that there is any connection between us.
 They know me under my chosen alias, ‚ÄúBill‚Äù and when I am done with this deal I will toss this pre-paid phone which I have nicknamed the crack-berry in the nearest dumpster and never be in this situation again.
 I am tired of sitting in this parking lot staring out over the tall weeds and watching every car and truck that drives in.
 The lot becomes more deserted as the night slowly drags on and the skies darken.

My mouth nearly hit the ground when I recognized the throaty roar and dark paint job of Brandon's Mustang.
 "I knew you'd be sitting here worrying she wouldn't come."
 It took a minute for the words to make sense.
 "Fine, but that doesn't shed any light on why you're all the way out here."
 The gray eyes just visible in the slowly growing light crinkled up in a smile.
 "I called her and told her I'd pick you up.
 She can take you home, I'll come pick you up every morning."
 My head was spinning.
 Why would the most popular boy in school want to pick me up for school every morning?

Still, neither of them made it more than a quarter of the way around before being slammed back down into their chairs.
 The tingly heat that'd convinced me Alec was staring at me earlier was back, and even more intense.
 I felt the tiny hairs on my neck stand up as the feeling redoubled yet again.
 The darker, more vocal of the two opened his mouth and got the first part of a swear word out before ending in a hiss of pain that was almost completely drowned out by a crescendo from the orchestra pit.
 Alec leaned forward, whispered something in each of their ears, and then finally let both of them go.
 I expected them to turn around swinging, or at least swear at him.
 I didn't expect them to remain in their seats stunned and shaking like trauma victims.
 An usher finally arrived to see what all of the commotion was about.
 The older boys shook themselves and then looked for a second like they were going to try and get Alec kicked out of the theater.
 The sense of being caught in some kind of electric sandstorm momentarily intensified, and then faded away as they got up and left.

I felt my knees almost collapse as the two packs slowly backed away from each other, and Jasmin joined me inside the classroom.
 Mrs. Campbell gave the two of us a considering look after reading Jasmin's note, but sent us off to a pair of empty seats at the back of the classroom without comment.
 We were starting a new unit, but I couldn't concentrate on the lecture.
 Alec's unshakable calm over the last few days had mostly convinced me the other members of his pack had been overreacting.
 Somehow I'd come to believe the coming dispute with Brandon's pack would be resolved as easily as a normal teenage dispute.
 After experiencing such intense, barely restrained violence, I was starting to see just how ludicrous that'd been.
 People had already died over what was going on here.
 It hadn't been real, either because I hadn't examined Simon and Nathanial's lifeless bodies, or maybe because I was repressing the experience like I'd done with so many other parts of my life lately.
 I could feel my mind trying to shut down, hoping to cushion me from the worst implications of what was coming.
 I knew it was going to be bad, could feel it in a sickening, only-seconds-away-from-vomiting kind of way, but couldn't follow the chain of logic through to the very end.

Brandon entered rehab about a month after I did the bust so he wasn‚Äôt on the streets for long after it all came crashing down.
 I think without the bust, he could have got killed for stealing from other drug dealers or been captured in a larger bust that he couldn‚Äôt negotiate his way out of.
 I knew through our exchange of e-mails that most times he busted someone they ended up repeating the same behavior eventually ending up in prison or dead.
 After getting to know the officer I began to realize he was never a bad guy at all as he was just doing a thankless job, often with grim results that left him feeling like his was a fruitless effort to cleanse the streets of dealers and addicts.
 When I contacted Officer White and invited him and his Sergeant to meet Brandon and me for coffee he quickly agreed.
 The officers were amazed at how healthy Brandon looked and how mature he acted.
 Brandon greeted them with a handshake that turned into a hug.
 He thanked them.
 I think the arrest helped him realize how long the police had been after him and how much they knew about him and that dealers he knew were working for the police.
 After rehab when his head was clear, and he knew how close he came to dying or going to prison, I think he respected what the police were doing.

Tired, I settled back into my seat.
 ‚ÄúSteed, tell me about breeding horses.‚Äù He sighed.
 ‚ÄúHow much detail do you want?‚Äù I giggled.
 He smiled as he started into the subject, explaining what he‚Äôd been taught about breeding techniques and dominant traits when he was young.
 His father had imparted to him all he had learned in his lifetime and all their ancestors had passed down before.
 They bred the animals methodically, striving to combine certain traits, bring them together in a single horse.
 With each generation, they strengthened the line, even bringing in new breeds from other lands to add to the list of desired attributes.
 Smoother gait, better endurance, stronger health, longer life.
 I faded off somewhere during the part about bloodlines.
 I woke late in the evening when Ruby switched places with Steed.

‚ÄúHarruq, I love you.

 She stood on her toes and gave him a quick, soft kiss on his lips.
 A tear ran down Harruq‚Äôs cheek as he stood in shock.
 His mind relished the soft feel of her lips on his, the scent of flowers, and the subtle fire that had escaped onto his tongue.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you tomorrow,‚Äù she said, taking a hesitant step toward the trees.
 ‚ÄúSure thing,‚Äù Harruq said, rubbing the tear off his cheek and pretending it had not been there.

 It'd sounded like the perfect job for Mom, albeit a short term one.
 Now it was sounding like it'd been too good to be true.
 The move had been something I'd opposed and then ignored when my opposition hadn't made any difference.

When he placed his hand on the tower door an involuntary shudder racked his body at the idea of following those orders one more time.
 He looked over again at the AElven maiden.
 To an exotic beauty like her a balding overweight man like himself would be invisible under normal circumstances.
 Some of the other guards might be tempted to take what would not be given, but not him.
 Like his mother always told him, a person did not have to own a beautiful sunset to enjoy watching it.
 The door to the top of Raven Tower was large and deeply carved in intricate designs and runes.
 Though as a youth Rodregas had trained in the basics of magic, a secret he was careful not to share, the magical runes were far beyond his understanding.
 He led the prisoners through the door and walked out onto the top of the tower.

If Isaac had been the one close enough to reach out and touch, I probably would've tried to get his attention and said hi.
 With Vincent, I just stayed quiet and hoped he wouldn't notice me.
 I didn't want to risk tripping and making my ankle worse, so I was paying especially close attention to where my feet were going.
 If I hadn't been looking down, I would have completely missed it.
 I still almost thought I'd imagined it, but there was no denying that Vincent's foot snaked out and nudged the ankle of the kid in front of him just hard enough to trip the smaller guy.
 The result was all out of proportion to what I expected.
 The smaller boy fell forward, careening towards the banister with so much force he knocked people in front of him out of the way.
 Just before I left elementary school someone had read us a newspaper article about some poor guy being pushed over a railing and falling to his death.
 I'd had nightmares for months.

 The dreams I had then were the most dreadful I‚Äôd ever had.
 I jolted awake and shuddered for several minutes at the images I could not beat down.
 Ruby was there, waiting for me.
 ‚ÄúWhere are the others?‚Äù I asked, voice hoarse.

His grades were terrible, and he kept getting in trouble for being in the wrong place at the wrong time or with the wrong person.
 For instance, he was put on probation for being in a car with someone who was in possession of a replica firearm.
 He looked like total shit, and when we confronted him about it he was feeling bad enough that he confessed: He was addicted to the pain pill known as Oxy.
 He told us that he needed our help to get off of it.
 We never thought to find the reasoning behind the drug abuse, we just thought he had tried it and grew to feel dependent on it.
 He was always a tough kid to raise and he was often a handful and we felt this problem could be handled like any other.
 But we were novices when it came to helping someone kick drug addiction.
 We did our best to assist him and we attempted to detox him at home.
 We called Brandon‚Äôs real doctor (not the ones who prescribe marijuana) and asked for guidance.
 We tried to keep him away from everyone we knew until we could get the drugs out of his system.

It had been brief, but she could remember everything about it in vivid detail.
 She closed her eyes as she stood in the shower, reliving the moment.
 In her mind she could see his face as he told her she was beautiful.
 Her heart had sped up then but nothing like when he'd tilted her chin up and looked into her eyes.
 She'd known then that he was going to kiss her, but she'd been unable to turn away.

Growing up with the example of his mother was a powerful object lesson regarding what happened to humans that got involved with shape shifters; but given enough time, I'd exploit that tiny piece of him that wanted exactly what I wanted.
 "Unless you're sending me away there's no point in having this conversation.
 I'm exactly where I want to be.

 Alec stared back up at the clouds rather than meet my eyes.

 At the very least, you should have started screaming.
 Instead you wander around, take in some rather feeble attempts at art, and then sneak out without saying a word."

 ‚ÄúBoth of you, stop that this instant!‚Äù
 Through blurred vision, Harruq saw a woman with auburn hair standing at the edge of the alley.
 The patrolmen also turned to look, their weapons still in hand.
 ‚ÄúWho the abyss‚Ä¶‚Äåoh, go on back to your forest, Aurelia.

 He slid his arm around her waist, pulling her against him.

 The dragon was lying on the ground, watching us closely.

He looked surprisingly uncertain, almost like he was used to working from a script, and didn't know what to do when things didn't go as planned.
 "Do you know when she'll be back?"
 My headshake seemed to unnerve him a little more.
 Presumably he was having a hard time believing in a world where people didn't have fixed schedules, where moms didn't let their daughters know when they'd be back from their outings.
 "The message really is quite urgent.
 Are you positive you don't have a way to contact her?
 Well then, I suppose I've no choice."
 Most people say they don't have a choice rather flippantly, but he seemed rather more like he had his back against the wall than I expected.
 "You know, I presume, that there was some confusion regarding the tourism project she bid out for the city?

It was only a few pages, about a fellow who wants peace and security, so he builds a special house with no windows.
 And he decides not to include a doorway.
 Once it‚Äôs done, he can‚Äôt get out.
 In the morning, Eric read it.
 No doubt he could have told me the theme wasn‚Äôt much different from my dream of going off with Karen to a secluded cabin, or from my quitting the baseball team so I could spend afternoons alone smashing golf balls.
 But Eric rarely gave answers to questions we could solve on our own.
 In that, he was like God, who perhaps respects us more than we deserve.
 In The Brothers Karamazov, Fyodor Dostoyevski gives a story of Jesus coming to earth during the Spanish inquisition.
 He only heals a few of the suffering crowd before soldiers arrest and deliver him to the Grand Inquisitor.

Such a fury possessed us, we might have stoned him to death.
 Except Eric and Steve had gone straight up the hillside.
 At first they dodged the barrage Tom threw.
 Then he stopped raging, held still for a moment, and sank to kneeling on the ledge.
 Probably he hadn‚Äôt slept in two nights.
 Because Eric and Steve had shamed us with their courage and merciful hearts, we let them bring Tom down the hillside to the shade of the grotto.
 Later I heard Eric coaching Tom that he should refuse to stuff the pain of his hurt feelings inside, because in there, it had no choice but to fester or explode.
 When the hospital released my mom, she could hardly cook, wash dishes, or attempt disciplining me.

What should be the limits placed on international involvement in the internal affairs of countries that, at least momentarily, are unable to help themselves?
 The sanctity of the sovereign state, like the sanctity of private property in a capitalist society, is a fundamental principle of the nation state system on which the present world community is based.
 Like the protectors of private property, the guardians of the sovereign state vigorously resist each attempt to limit its scope or qualify its power ‚Äì although in both instances there are obvious and well-recognized limits and qualifications.
 The sensitivity over the issue of sovereignty ‚Äì especially among former colonies and victims of imperialist aggression ‚Äì is quite understandable in view of the fact that the emergence of modern nation states over the last two centuries occurred during a period when imperialist wars and colonial conquests were accepted as part of the normal conduct of international relations.
 It is a measure of the world‚Äôs progress in this century that this standard of conduct is no longer tolerated by the international community.
 The formulation of current policy on racial memories of past exploitation or persecution is no more appropriate or conducive to human progress, however, than the false conception of policies based on an exaggerated sense of pride or egocentric self-importance derived from the glory of forceful conquest in the past.
 In both instances, attitudes of the past must give way to fresh attitudes oriented to the future.
 Some member states are understandably wary of raising these issues, out of concern that their re-examination could become an excuse for outright political interference in the internal affairs of sovereign nations, a concern which is reinforced by the non-representative character and lack of impartiality of the Security Council.
 Other nations are reluctant to assume the greater responsibilities that a clearly enunciated doctrine might impose on them.
 All would agree, however, that neither an infinite fragmentation of nation states along ethnic, cultural, religious or linguistic lines, nor a blind indifference to persecution or unconscionable neglect of its own citizens by a state government, can be justified by either reason or lofty legal principles, or be permitted by the human heart and conscience to go unchecked.

exercising sovereignty over sovereign92m nation0m92m states0m must be thoroughly tested92m at0m every turn.

The history of civilization is the process of humankind discovering greater and greater resources and learning how to utilize them to acquire higher and higher levels of physical security, productive power and comfort.
 In the earliest phase, these resources were almost exclusively material.
 The next phase brought the discovery of tools and instruments that made the material resources far more productive and valuable than before.
 Gradually, society discovered rudimentary organizational resources ‚Äì the capacity to organize productive activities in a more effective manner.
 The organization of farming utilized the tree to make a plough with which to cultivate repeatedly the same land, giving birth to sedentary societies.
 The organization of crafts, commerce, armies, governments ‚Äì constructed from a fabric of customs, rules, systems and laws ‚Äì each made use of the material resources for greater productivity, power and achievement.
 At each stage of this evolution, society discovered the power of knowledge to increase further the productivity of the material, technological and organizational resources at its disposal.
 A knowledge of weather patterns boosted productivity in agriculture.
 A knowledge of astronomy enabled sea-worthy vessels to travel across the oceans to distant lands.
 This led to the invention of systematic education as a method to pass on acquired knowledge and skills to the next generation and thereby continuously increase them.

There are significant precedents for the utilization of the military to support the environment and development ‚Äì for construction of roads in Ethiopia and Yemen, bridges in Guatemala, as well as harbours, canals, railways and airfields; for afforestation projects and monitoring wildlife in India; for training of mechanics, electricians, and other productive skills; for urban renewal projects and drug enforcement in the United States, harvesting of crops in the USSR, flood rescue operations in Bangladesh, nuclear clean-up at Chernobyl, damage limitation after the vast oil spills and oil fires in Kuwait, humanitarian relief for Kurdish refugees, distribution of food and medicine in Bosnia and a host of other activities.
 In many developing countries the military can assist with efforts to improve social services in rural areas on a war footing ‚Äì to spread literacy, primary education, basic vocational skills, health care and access to safe drinking water.
 The military have at their disposal scientific and technological resources which in many cases can be applied to environmental protection with the minimum of adaptation, such as information and monitoring systems that track changes in the atmosphere, in the oceans and on earth‚Äôs surface.
 These resources can be applied to environmental monitoring and impact assessment, protection of endangered species, quick response to disasters and accidents, energy conservation, and the minimization and management of waste.
 The appropriate role for the military in these various activities will depend on the country, the urgency of the circumstances, and the cost-effectiveness of military involvement compared with available alternatives.
 In some instances, it may be feasible to establish international ‚ÄòEarth corps units‚Äô, specially trained and equipped to carry out certain types of environmental protection and restoration, such as India‚Äôs eco-battalions, which seek to conserve the Himalayan habitat by restoring tree cover and constructing small dams and canals.

Now that he'd told her he loved her, had opened his heart to her completely, he couldn't bear the thought that she might not walk back into his arms.
 So when he at last saw her moving through the fog, he ran to snatch her up.

 She could barely breathe but didn't want to be released.
 When he at last set her down, she continued to cling to him.

 I was contemplating possible ways to sleep on a horse when he finally stopped.
 We were riding through a small pass, the moonlight barely lighting our way, and Chevelle‚Äôs horse disappeared.
 My head swiveled, searching for any sign of them, and then my own horse turned beneath an overhang and stopped in a cavern so dark I hadn‚Äôt seen it until we were there.
 Chevelle tossed out a small flame, giving us enough light to dismount.

 Doi‚Äôvan trailed the others and then stepped back toward Rodregas room.
 Rodregas sagged against the bed, the wound of losing Imeralda hurting more than those of his flesh.
 ‚ÄúYou said you knew she was a Nymph,‚Äù stated Doi‚Äôvan.
 Rodregas nodded.

 The center of the wall exploded inward, but this time Aurelia was prepared.
 A rolling thunder of sound shoved all the broken shards forward, sending even the remaining chunks of the wall down the street in a chaotic assault.
 Velixar grinned.

To me, the key to living well is living in a way that gives an opportunity for appreciating nature and friends and taking time for prayer and writing and helping people.
 And unless you inherit a pile of money, the way to live like that is to not want a lot of stuff.
 Most stuff is just clutter.
 But our culture feeds the desire to own or consume until what we think we need makes us greedy.
 ‚ÄúThe Bible says that we should work so we‚Äôll have something to share with people in need.
 I can work for a few days a week and by not letting myself want a bunch of stuff, I can have money to give away.
 So I‚Äôm careful about what I buy, and I pick the things I do buy for durability and longevity.

Qurrah could see two men positioned on either side of the campfire.
 They kept their backs to the fire and sat far enough away so their eyes would not fully adjust to its light.
 They camped within a sparse copse of trees, the trunks not nearly thick enough to hide their approach.
 ‚ÄúThey are wise and alert,‚Äù he whispered.
 ‚ÄúPerhaps I can get close enough to cast a spell on one or two.

I didn‚Äôt expect what was there.
 On my way in, I found the spot where we had met so many days.
 I almost didn‚Äôt recognize it‚Äîbare of growth, the dirt patted down from years of wear.
 And then I saw him, the man in tattered clothes, hunched with his face in his hands.
 He heard me approach and raised his head, the awe all that was recognizable.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre back.‚Äù His voice was trembling, feeble.
 It was my Noble, young no more.
 He had been waiting here for my return.
 He was an outcast of the village; no one believed his tales of magic, the mysterious woman he claimed to meet here.

A stray eddy of wind played across my muzzle, and I knew they'd made their first mistake.
 I pressed into my second in command for a moment, conveying an order through posture and motion, and then nipped at Jasmin's heels, the two of us stretching out in a full sprint.
 Free from the others, Jasmin and I streaked through the night with a speed the rest of our pack couldn't have matched.
 Jasmin pressed at my flank, curious at my decision until she caught the scent, and then an answering growl made its way past her fangs.
 The trap was clever, but the other wolves didn't know the terrain well enough.
 I let my beast bubble up from the corner of my being where I usually kept it chained.
 Between one moment and the next, I went from running on four legs to two.
 As my transformation ended, a six-foot tower of muscle and claws sprang from the shadows.
 I ducked Vincent's first blow and retaliated with a gash that opened one side of his chest nearly down to the bone.

Miles Davis, Gerry Mulligan, Stan Getz, Horace Silver, Coltrane, George Shearing.
 Sylvia had taught Eric to revere and me to appreciate those fellows.
 We shot pool at Mike‚Äôs, where Kerouac had drunk plenty, according to Big Sur.
 We slouched in the catacombs of City Lights bookstore reading apocalyptic poems and hoping for a glimpse of the owner, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the poet who loaned Kerouac his Big Sur cabin.
 We roamed alleys and climbed hills no doubt mistaking mathematicians, who commuted daily to San Jose, for poets or novelists.
 Everybody who looked at home, we imagined had flopped in the Beat boarding houses Kerouac immortalized, or at least listened to the man speak his words in the Cellar, accompanied by a jazz riffing tenor sax.
 We overdosed on espresso.
 Then, as we climbed a hill to recover, I recited a jumble of lines I remembered from Ginsberg's Howl: "I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix, wandered around and around at midnight in the railway yard wondering where to go, and loned it through the streets of Idaho seeking visionary Indian angels, and lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup, a hopeless task, and so took ship and disappeared into the volcanoes of Mexico leaving nothing behind but the shadow of dungarees and the larva and ash of poetry..." And I recited from On the Road about the children crying in Iowa where they let the children cry and where "the evening star must be drooping and spreading her sparkler dims on the prairie, which is just before the coming of complete night that blesses the earth, darkens the all rivers, cups the peaks and folds the final shore in."
 We explored every street and alley of North Beach and drifted into Chinatown, where I imagined us meeting two exquisite immigrant girls.

Even if we have a successful raid against an Immortalist, we will need to be far away before a large group of The Immortal Guard can track us down.
 The Immortal Guards, or at least their officers, use Dire Steeds.
 If we are mounted on regular horses and they come after us on Dire Steeds, well, they will track us down and outnumber us the first time we strike.‚Äù  Doi‚Äôvan nodded at that.
 Rodregas had the impression that he had not thought of anything but the actual fight.
 Imeralda said, ‚ÄúOk, that is all fine.
 You two need to find Dire Steeds and magic armor and weapons before you fight the Immortal Guards.
 Good luck finding that up here in the mountains.

The truth was that even if one of the gods was backing Rodregas, it was more likely to be some god who was pissed off at the Immortalists; one looking for a chosen champion for their own selfish reasons.
 As a child Rodregas had dreamed of being such a champion, but Paladin‚Äôs were always chosen from the ranks of the Order of the Soaring Heavens, and while Rodregas had once served the Order as a squire he had never came close to achieving knighthood.
 ‚ÄúAll right, Sir Paladin, I have to admit I have talked to the Sorcerer Ravenhurr a few too many times, and you definitely don‚Äôt seem to be him.
 Nevertheless, we are taking your wagon and your supplies.
 We will let you go in peace in the morning,‚Äù said Audrian in that tone of voice that implied that he just expected people to follow his orders.
 ‚ÄúHand over the shorts swords,‚Äù Audrian continued, gesturing at the two blades that Rodregas had yet to pull.
 ‚ÄúWe will return one in the morning.‚Äù Rodregas smiled and nodded and pulled the two swords out simultaneously.
 He was starting to think his new body was ambidextrous, equally comfortable with both hands.
 That could prove useful, but would require some additional training to take full advantage of.
 ‚ÄúActually, since I was kicking your ass barehanded, even with a knife in my belly, how about this: I won‚Äôt kill the bunch of you if you keep your distance and leave my camp at first light?‚Äù Rodregas‚Äô tone was casual.

Chevelle held up two fingers slightly to silence me.
 We hadn‚Äôt ridden more than a quarter of the way into town when he turned the horses to a medium-sized structure, stopping before a water trough.
 He dismounted effortlessly and pulled me from my horse and into the building in a few quick steps, closing the door behind us.
 It was dark inside, his fingers lingering on my arm.
 I felt him shift, waving a hand as several lanterns around the main room lit, giving off a soft glow.
 He indicated a door on the rear wall.
 ‚ÄúYour room.‚Äù I drew back my hood, nodding.
 ‚ÄúI have some business to take care of before we move on.‚Äù Move on?

The huge structure had been built into and around the top of a granite hilltop.
 The walls were hundreds of feet high in most places and constructed of the very sides of the mountain simply carved flat and smooth.
 Because it was built directly on and out of the very bedrock of the Earth, knocking down the fortress walls was not an option for an opposing army.
 Like the stone of the farmhouse, the stone construction of the Cathedral had been enchanted by Nymphs of the Earth.
 It was said that the ley lines were tapped to provide magical protections as great as the physical.
 The Cathedral‚Äôs defenses gave it the reputation as one of the most impenetrable fortress in the Eastern Realms.
 Of course, Rodregas thought what could not be taken by force, could be easily taken by politics and fear.
 Once through both the huge gates, Rodregas, Doi‚Äôvan and Imeralda came into full view of the Great Cathedral of the Heavens.
 The Cathedral served as both fortress and a temple to the Celestial Gods, and its thick walls were a balance of the practical and the artistic.
 Its towering white walls were adorned with statues and engravings.

 Dominic's presence as she stepped around the corner seemed to be the deciding factor.

 Alec's tone was still conversational as he shoved Vincent backwards and allowed his hand to return to normal.
 "The harassment of my people stops now."

 My heart raced until he finally relaxed and sank back down with me.
 "Please don't let on that you know.
 I wasn't supposed to say anything.
 I just couldn't let you go after her."

It was horrifying and amazing all at once, and it made complete sense.

 "We're where the legends of succubi originated.

 I'd finally worked through things enough inside my mind, to respond, but he bulldozed right over me.

 If you somehow survive everything that's about to happen, it would leave you forever hungering for another touch, but never able to fulfill that desire."

There was another flicker of something I couldn't quite read in Alec's eyes, but I was long past caring.
 I turned and limped off, wishing my ankle was in better shape so I could properly stomp.
 Spanish arrived much too soon.
 Since I hadn't gotten in trouble wandering the halls so far, it was a definite temptation to skip the last hour of school too.
 Unfortunately my luck was bound to give out sooner or later, and then I'd be in even more trouble.
 The last thing I needed was a record of delinquency to go along with my failing grade in Biology.
 Mrs. Tiggs was positively glowing as we all walked into her classroom.
 She popped out of her chair as soon as the bell rang, and began handing out graded tests.
 My world started trembling as I turned my test over and saw an 'F' at the top of the page.
 'Come see me after class.'

I reached forward, placing my palm against his, and then he was gone.
 His entire body had vanished.
 I half expected to feel his touch‚Äîperhaps he‚Äôd merely camouflaged himself‚Äîbut my hand was empty.
 I looked around, baffled.
 The makeshift audience wore easy, amused smiles.
 They watched me, not the vacant space from which Grey had evidently disappeared.
 And then I noticed someone beside me who hadn‚Äôt been there before‚Ä¶ it was him.
 ‚ÄúHow‚Ä¶‚Äù But he was gone again.
 I‚Äôd been staring right at him and had no idea where he‚Äôd gone.
 I was just beginning to doubt whether I‚Äôd seen him at all when I spotted him standing across the circle, grinning fiendishly while he dangled an object from his hands.

Rodregas knew that this was probably it.
 They had gambled and lost, there were just too many of them.
 But he did not want to die without taking out the Immortal Guards first.
 If he killed the slavers and the guards, there was a good chance that the slaves could escape.
 If Rodregas and his group died without taking the slavers and guards out, then they would have died in vain.
 Rodregas hoped Imeralda would get away.
 His shoulder jerked to the left, and he guessed that he had been hit by an arrow.
 Rodregas threw himself toward the last guard.
 He blocked the sword blow with his borrowed shield but did not have the angle to avoid a direct impact.
 The sword sliced through the shield and Rodregas jerked his arm back fearing that he would lose it.

Even with the most perfect subjects, I still generally fail to capture their true essence."
 "But not all?"
 "No, not all of them."
 It was getting harder and harder to string thoughts together in a comprehensible manner.
 "Sounds fulfilling.
 Busy, but fulfilling."
 Alec waited so long to respond that I nearly drifted off.
 "It's always seemed fulfilling.
 At least until recently."
 I wanted to know what he meant, but couldn't muster the willpower.
