 Liz – What would he do?
 Jim – Sumo Assassin would race to the courthouse on the Sumo-mobile crash it through the walls and then Aunt Jeihmima the judge, backing over him once or twice to make sure that the judge would stay down.
 That would only happen after Eugene’s father received the same treatment.
 Liz – I guess that wouldn’t work here.
 Jim – Nope.
 Guess we have two choices here, wait till Gene’s father dies and then move forward with the adoption, or forget it all.

Anyone who would be so controlling to someone like Rachel had already piled up all kinds of bad karma.
 "Fair enough.
 What's your favorite book that you've never read?"
 The question seemed to take her by surprise.
 "Um, Gone With the Wind.
 Probably because she doesn't necessarily start out as a bad person, but allows self-interest and events to carry her into terrible actions."
 I felt my eyes go wide.
 "That's a pretty detailed analysis of a book you've never read."
 Rachel blushed a little.
 "I really haven't read it.

He had often looked into the darkness.
 For the first time, the darkness had looked back, and it was amused.
 Whoever this necromancer was, Qurrah knew he had been an idiot to challenge him.
 “Lead the way,” Qurrah said.
 “And forgive my outburst.”
 “I understand,” Harruq said, ignoring the pain in his knees and the bit of blood running from his elbow to his wrist.
 “We need to hurry, though.”
 He looped his arm through Qurrah’s and then hurried down the alley.
 As a soldier’s body collapsed at the end, the two stopped, and Harruq swore.
 “The orcs made it through,” he said, to which Qurrah nodded.

“Okay, Jazell, what exactly did he say?” Emily asked, pencil poised in the air ready to write.
 “He said, ‘He’s rising, he’s rising’.
 I have no idea who he meant or if what he said means anything.” Emily scribbled down, Toad dwarf said, “He’s rising, he’s rising”.
 Who’s coming and is he important?
 I stared at the paper, the question swirling in my mind.
 Who did he mean?
 “Now what did the dwarf tell you, Seth?” she asked.
 “He said, ‘You won’t stop him, little warrior.’” He frowned at the last part.
 Emily added, Toad Dwarf told Seth, “You won’t stop him, little warrior.” Does this mean he’s powerful?
 “Did you have to add the ‘little warrior’ part?

In 1991 the industrial nations spent more than $180 billion on agricultural subsidies to support their farm populations, which is three times the total world overseas development assistance.
 These subsidies cost Western consumers another $135 billion annually in terms of higher food costs.
 Agricultural protectionism in the North not only places powerful constraints on exports from developing countries, but also directly interfere with the livelihood of one-third of the entire human race living in developing countries.
 The elimination of the system of quotas and subsidies to Western farmers can dramatically reduce the budget deficits of industrial nations and bring down food prices, while stimulating large-scale expansion of agriculture, industrialization and job growth in developing countries.
 Existing trade barriers by the industrial nations to textile exports cost developing countries an estimated $50 billion annually.
 The complete elimination of these barriers could result in a doubling of textile exports by developing countries.
 This labour-intensive industry can be another engine for job creation in developing countries and rising demand for technology and capital goods from the industrial nations.
 The progressive reduction, leading to the eventual elimination, of barriers to trade in agricultural products and textiles is an important step that can substantially improve the employment opportunities of people in developing countries.
 5.Improve access to markets: The most important structural change in the world economy over the past 35 years has been the five-fold increase in the world share of manu factured exports gained by the developing countries as a group, up from 4 per cent to 19 per cent, compared with a current market share of about 13 per cent each of the United States and for Japan.
 Although 54 per cent of these manufactures come from five top exporting countries, a large number of countries export more than $1 billion in this category annually.

I hadn't thought about what it would be like this year."
 Alec nodded like he'd just checked a box off on some kind of mental list.
 "So snow's always been a pretty key ingredient sounds like."
 "I guess.
 It hadn't really sunk in that we wouldn't be getting any of that this year.
 A month ago I would have thought that was a good thing, that it would be one less thing to remind me of Dad and Cindi.
 I think I might actually miss it this year though."
 I rested my head against Alec's shoulder.
 "It doesn't really matter.
 The important thing now is that we're together for Christmas.

Math had never been my favorite subject.
 I'd always managed to pull A's or at least A-'s, but hated all of the little nitpicky rules.
 Unfortunately, after missing a whole month of classes, I was at least as bad off in Algebra as I was in Biology.
 Mrs. Campbell was solving problems with so many variables in them it was like watching alphabet soup spontaneously re-arrange itself on her overhead projector.
 Not only that, things were being squared and cubed, an operation with which I had only passing familiarity.
 I struggled valiantly to understand what was going on.
 I got the sense the operations being applied to the formulas were being explained very well, I just didn't have the vocabulary to follow what she was saying.
 By the time class finally ended I was fighting not to become emotional.
 The fact that Britney looked for a moment like she was debating whether or not to wait for me before finally stopping next to the door with her arms crossed, didn't help.
 I threw my book and binder into my backpack and tromped up to the front of the classroom.

The share of trade in global GDP rose from 12 per cent in 1970 to 29 per cent in 2001.
 While the effects of expanding world trade on employment are complex and can lead to displacement of workers and destruction of jobs in some cases, available evidence strongly indicates that the overall impact of freer trade on the global economy will be to promote significantly faster growth of employment opportunities.
 The emerging liberalization of textile trade in 2005 is an example of the potential positive impact of freer trade.
 In India the textile industry provides employment to 18 per cent of the entire workforce, accounts for 8 per cent of the country's GDP, 17 per cent of its manufacturing capacity, and 27 per cent of its export earnings.
 A recent projection indicates that with the lifting of quotas under the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing in January 2005, India’s textile exports could rise from the current $16 billion to $40 billion by 2010, creating as many as 12 million new jobs in the process, five million jobs through direct employment in the textile industry and another seven million jobs in allied sectors.
 The global manufacturing strategies of multinational corporations will further spur the exponential growth of contract manufacturing opportunities in developing countries.
 Already China exports $300 billion a year in manufactured products, while Taiwan and Mexico export more than $140 billion each.
 According to a recent study, India has the potential to create 25 to 30 million new jobs in the manufactured exports sector.
 Shift to Services: One would hardly expect to find the decline of manufacturing jobs as a source of employment opportunities, but historical data supports this conclusion.
 Fear over the destruction of manufacturing jobs due to adoption of capital intensive technology has been prevalent for the past 100 years.

So to keep them off my track I traveled in and out of ley lines to throw off the magic scent.
 This one runs underground before coming out in this small valley.
 I was trying to find the ley line again.
 That is how I found the old farmhouse.” Ley lines are like rivers of magic energy that encircle the world.
 Most major Immortalist keeps and other magic locations are located either on one, or where two of them cross.
 Magicians love them for all the free magical power just flowing by to use.
 But while there is plenty of power it is not easy to use.
 The power is naturally full of disturbances and chaotic energies.
 The horror stories of magicians having terrible accidents with spells gone crazy on ley lines were legend.
 This is why Immortalists used circles to manage the power.

I'd kind of known I'd have an incredible amount of material to catch up on from the first part of the semester.
 I hadn't anticipated that every other student was going to spend the class carefully ignoring me.
 I'd never really fit in, but this was unbelievable.
 New students could always count on someone to offer to be their friends.
 I'd seen it a dozen times before as people had moved in.
 The really attractive people got drawn into the popular circles, less cool people were offered a place with the punks, the nerds, or at least with the drug users, who didn't care as much what you looked or acted like as long as you were hooked on something illegal.
 I knew I had serious problems, but I didn't think they were obvious to everyone that looked at me.
 English was next, and odds were it would be a nearly exact repeat of Biology, possibly minus the awkward introduction.
 The thin, distinguished looking teacher absently accepted my proffered form, starting a little when I didn't leave.

"Open it and see."
 She took it, glancing at his face as she raised the lid.
 The sapphire immediately caught the light, and she gasped.
 "This is beautiful!"
 He reached out to take her hand.
 "Marie, will you marry me?"
 She gazed at him for a moment before crying, "Yes!"
 and throwing her arms around his neck.
 Gently disengaging her arms, he took the ring from the box and slid it onto her finger.
 "I love you, Marie."

And then he stood and walked away.
 I sat unmoving for a moment, and then finally glanced at the group.
 They were deeply involved in their conversations, seemingly unaware of the encounter that had my heart in my throat.
 I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, attempting to “move about” in my mind.
 It was completely frustrating.
 Fuzzy, wrong.
 Nothing worked.
 None of it connected the way it should have.
 It made me angry and tired and the maddening fight against it gained me nothing but a buzzing headache.
 I sighed and threw myself on my blankets away from the group.

“I thought I had to come out here to get a search party.” “I, uh… you were in my room?” He straightened, his expression making it clear he hadn’t expected that response.
 I pressed, taking the chance.
 “Why?” I heard movement behind me and the fear returned tenfold.
 Chevelle didn’t tense; he only let out an exasperated breath.
 “It’s fine,” he said.
 He released me and I turned to see who he’d addressed.
 Four figures stood in a line, almost a formation, and they relaxed at his words.
 My arm tingled as the blood returned to the limb, freed of his harsh grip.
 Yes, he hates me.
 I flexed my fist.

Epilogue Names were changed in this work of narrative non-fiction to protect the innocent and the not-so-innocent.
 Steve and Ashley: I would later find out that Steve posted bail and was busted shortly thereafter for robbery and assault as he pistol-whipped and beat his next victim.
 By the time he went to trial for this bust, he had also been busted again for another drug deal.
 Steve is now serving five years in prison.
 The last I heard about Ashley is that she is prostituting herself to support her drug habit.
 NARCONON: Information about Narconon is readily available on the Internet; the official site explains the theories of detoxification, based on the work of L. Ron Hubbard.
 Brandon: Sadly, as he neared the 2-year sobriety mark, Brandon relapsed.
 I immediately knew just by talking to him over the phone.
 I wouldn’t have noticed the changes in his behavior had I not come to know the new sober Brandon after his treatment at Narconon and his subsequent employment at the facility.
 Brandon reluctantly agreed to return to Narconon to try to discover “what he had missed” but he didn’t go easily.

Protectionism reduces overall economic welfare, often hurting those with the lowest incomes.
 In the long term greater international trade, like technology, expands overall employment opportunities substantially.
 Trade also counters the tendency of prices to increase along with incomes in more developed countries.
 Living standards rise as consumers benefit from the availability of lower-priced imported consumer goods.
 One of the greatest barriers to solving the world’s employment problem is the perception that trade destroys jobs.
 As in the case of technology, the interactions are complex and must be viewed in their entirety, rather than in isolated industries.
 The global economy is not a zero sum game in which increased production by one country must necessarily result in reduced production by another.
 Trade opens up new opportunities.
 It permits each country to specialize in industries where it possesses a ‘comparative advantage’.
 This specialization enables it to evolve improved processes to achieve higher levels of quality and productivity, larger production volumes and lower costs.

All agreed that no matter what might happen with the greater sigils that all should gain the minor Sigil of Healing.
 Its benefits to warriors and mages alike were well known.
 Jordaan agreed to do the inscribing and show the others the technique.
 In return Imeralda would inscribe Jordaan who was also eager for the sigil.
 Jordaan had his hand out with the palm facing up.
 At Jordaan’s direction Rodregas put his own, palm up, on top of it.
 The frog went on top and Jordaan’s other hand went on top of the frog.
 Jordaan then said, “This is going to hurt, it will feel like someone is drawing a pattern under your skin with a knife.
 If you pull away before it is done, you will mess up the pattern and it will use up your magic without adding the benefits of the sigil.” As Jordaan finished speaking he looked in Rodregas’ eyes until he nodded his understanding.
 He knew what was coming.

That cooled the flush and I grimaced, moving to stand.
 I hadn’t done so since the incident and my head spun.
 I wobbled, and Chevelle was suddenly there, steadying me.
 I shook off his look of concern.
 “I’m fine.
 Really.” He shifted closer and I became wholly aware of his hands at my waist.
 The grip he’d used to steady me became softer and yet, at the same time, his fingers tightened around me.
 My breath hitched as he pulled me against him, the length of our bodies touching.
 My throat went dry, black spots swirling in my vision.
 I fought to stay focused on his face, so close.

During 1993, 42 countries were involved in 52 major conflicts, and another 37 experienced political violence.
 Terrorist warfare, whose principal aim is to threaten social peace, has become the model for conflicts in Northern Ireland, the Middle East and the drug war in Colombia.
 Modern means of communication, increased vulnerabilities of inter-dependent, integrated civil societies, and modern instruments of violence make these forms of war extremely destructive.
 The expansion of war to encompass society poses one of the most serious challenges to national and international security and development and raises fundamental questions regarding war as an instrument of policy.
 For more than two centuries, war has been rationalized as an appropriate instrument in international affairs.
 The increasing destructiveness of violent conflict to society in general has resulted in a shift in military strategy from actual fighting to preventive diplomacy.
 The Helsinki Process, the Stockholm Document, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Warsaw Treaty’s adoption of the doctrine of ‘non-offensive defence’, and most recently the UN Secretary General’s Agenda for Peace – all give highest priority to war prevention.
 While welcome, these incremental measures do not fully recognize either the extent of the danger of the continued application of violence to achieve political ends or the extent of the opportunity which the end of the Cold War has brought for radically altering the way in which humanity settles domestic and international disputes.
 There was a time when war could be justified as a necessary expedient.
 Now the potential human and economic costs of even limited terrorist war – especially if it involves the use of nuclear or biological weapons, but even otherwise – are so great that the risks are no longer tolerable.

I encouraged their interests by making sure they had the equipment they needed to pursue them.
 For instance, when Brandon showed a real interest in and talent for photography, he received his dream camera for Christmas.
 I have loved my wife and I have shown my children that I love them.
 The boys have witnessed firsthand what a healthy spousal relationship is and that was something I never saw in my childhood home.
 I always believed in teaching my children to respect all people in all walks of life.
 On the holidays I sent my boys out to give freshly baked cookies to the people who collected our garbage.
 I taught the boys how to care for our yard, mowing and edging, and they had household responsibilities and chores (and I never sprayed them with a hose nozzle, at least not to compel yard work).
 I believed they needed to learn good strong work ethics.
 But I never once hit them, and I never abused them, as I had learned “what not to do” as a father.
 I did everything I could think of to give them the best chance to succeed in life.

She did her best to comfort him, stroking his hair until all his dark strength drained away.
 Exhaustion came soon after, and for an agonizing time Harruq lay there, mumbling incoherently and waiting for the pain to fade.
 At last, he looked up to Aurelia, his eyes a calm brown, the whites bloodshot.
 “I love you,” he said.
 Sleep took him, and relieved, Aurelia let her own eyes close and her hair drape across his face.

The most gorgeous, kind boy I'd ever met had just professed his love to me, and strangely enough it made what I had to do next both harder and easier.
 "Alec, what if I were to go back to Brandon?
 Would that stop everything from going wrong?
 I mean, then you wouldn't have been poaching his property or whatever you call it."
 It was bad enough that my heart was shattering as I said it, the look in Alec's face made everything a hundred times worse.
 For a second I thought the earth was shaking, but it was Alec, trembling much like he'd done Friday night.
 A loud crack from beside us made me jump.
 Alec looked at the branch, easily as thick as my arm, which he'd just torn from the tree we were leaning against.
 He stopped shaking as he considered what he'd done to the poor tree.
 "You're saying that because you're worried for me?

I let Jasmin help me pull my books together, and then numbly followed her out to the hallway.
 Alec and the rest of the pack were waiting for us at my locker.
 Jasmin calmly opened my locker and put my things away while I was still trying to come to terms with everything.
 Alec took my hand.
 "Are you okay?"
 I shook my head.
 "This is going to be really bad, isn't it?"
 His silence validated my belief, probably even more than he realized.
 "I'd...we'd...spare you it if we could."
 It was my turn to shake my head.

I opened my mouth, maybe to laugh the comment off, or otherwise hedge my bets against the humiliation and inevitable mocking laughter.
 Whatever it was I'd intended on saying evaporated away the instant he reached out and slowly slid his finger down the side of my face.
 The tiny part of me that was still screaming none of this could be real was pulled along by the rest of me.
 I completely abandoned myself to the sensations created by his touch.
 My nerve endings didn't know whether to classify his finger as icy cold or scorching hot, but before I could recoil in pain the sensation gave way to a tingly warmth that sank down into my center, simultaneously tightening and relaxing parts I didn't even know I had.
 My pounding heart seemed loud enough to hear from across the street.
 I opened my eyes, afraid he could somehow hear the overworked muscle, already flushing red with embarrassment, only to find a gentle smile waiting for me.
 If there was any insincerity to the expression, I was utterly unable to detect it.
 I cleared my throat, seeking to avoid the awkwardness that always followed these kinds of moments, but Brandon effortlessly defused all of that by opening my door and helping me into the car.
 "I'm sorry I wasn't around yesterday.

 he would have thought that most 22 year olds in the 1920s would be married.
 Especially a girl as beautiful as this one.
 But Tranton was her family name, so she apparently wasn’t.
 Scanning the text on the page opposite the picture, he found a little information about her.
 She’d gotten married at 23—a year after the picture had been taken.
 And she’d died in 1941.
 So young!
 She’d been only 37.

I was instructed to meet the police over an hour before the scheduled time.
 During this entire time since Brandon was busted, my wife and I had been working to detox him.
 We had him on complete lockdown at the house with no visitors allowed.
 His room and the entire house were still searched daily, including the CD cases and every nook and cranny.
 We used the professional drug tests and we tested him randomly.
 Hopefully he hadn’t found a way to get this drug into our home (again).
 He finished the worst of the drug withdrawals a couple of days after the disastrous intervention.
 When Officer White called, the bust was on.
 I hugged and kissed Brandon and Lisa as if I was about to ship off to a war.
 I felt guilty that I couldn’t say something to my younger son Bryce but he was now back at college and we hadn’t told him what I was doing for Brandon.

He did not attempt either stealth or silence.
 Seething, he limped back to Qurrah and their home.
 Neither said a word as he discarded his armor, tossed his swords into a corner, and crashed onto their bed of straw.
 For a long moment, only the sound of Harruq’s heavy breathing filled the room.
 “I assume things didn’t go well?” Qurrah finally asked.
 Harruq didn’t bother to answer.

Even Rachel's frequent teasing hadn't ever managed to crack his 'working face'.
 "I hardly think that would be the case.
 While you may very well have lost your way, it would have been a small matter for one of the others to track you down.
 You have, if I may say so, a very distinctive smell.
 It reminds me of a type of sage brush that hasn't grown here in quite some time."
 His sigh was more felt than heard, and it put me in mind of mountains, redwoods, and other ancient things.
 "Donovan, can I ask you a question?"
 "Of course, mistress.
 I'm afraid there are many which I won't be able to answer, but it would be a delight to share those things which haven't been forbidden me."
 "You're really old, aren't you?"

Brandon stood up from where he'd been leaning against the sports car and flashed me a blinding smile.
 He moved towards me with a casual grace that made little shivers run through me despite my earlier decision not to let his interest, or lack thereof, affect me.
 "I had a bet with myself that you weren't going to wait.
 Somehow the fact I just lost doesn't matter now."
 It didn't seem possible he was talking to me, that anyone so gorgeous could mean something like that about me.
 I opened my mouth, maybe to laugh the comment off, or otherwise hedge my bets against the humiliation and inevitable mocking laughter.
 Whatever it was I'd intended on saying evaporated away the instant he reached out and slowly slid his finger down the side of my face.

They were killing the final hour before dark.
 Then they would hoist the wrapped body onto Harruq’s shoulder and sneak out of town.
 Qurrah sat meditating in a corner while Harruq yammered to himself.
 The blade was in one hand, the decorative scabbard in the other.
 “He was a skilled swordsman,” Qurrah said.
 “He was also arrogant.
 I would expect such a blade from one like him.”
 Harruq shrugged.
 “If I didn’t have my own two swords, I’d use it.”
 The half-orc cut the blade through the air a few times and then sheathed it.

Whoever said that ought to be gagged.
 At least in my family, while one kid slept, the other wouldn’t.
 When one behaved, the other raised hell.
 Everything one gets, the other wants.
 And so on.
 (Read Mark Twain’s Roughing It to learn how this plays out in large Mormon families.)
 I told Pam one kid would be plenty for me and suggested that even the one could wait until after I had rested for a couple years from raising Darcy and Cody, who by now were adults so admirable that just thinking about them often made me glow.
 Several of my friends with grown kids had married younger women and right away gotten snipped, but I couldn’t deny Pam the experience of being a mother, knowing I might’ve remained a loveless semi-zombie without Darcy and Cody.
 But neither was I going to insist that she have one.
 As far as I could tell, Pam wanted a career more than a baby.

I crawled through the narrow path I’d made the previous time.
 It hadn’t seemed such a tight fit in only pants.
 I settled in, jerking a length of skirt free from the thorns with a spray of colorless beads.
 Brushing the loose dirt off the papers I had buried, I laid the soiled documents across my lap and untied the laces binding them together.
 I stared at the words on the ancient parchment, unable to believe what I was reading was true.
 It had to be; it was signed with the official seal, staring back at me from the smudged white fabric of my skirt, the letters on the page as real and words as patent as they could be.
 The documents held the details of a trial, and not only a trial, a punishment.
 The punishment of Francine Katteryn Glaforia, found guilty of practicing dark magic.
 Her sentence included some sort of service to council and a spell binding her from using magic of any kind except practical.
 I was dumbfounded.

From within he pulled out a suit of armor stained a deep shade of black.
 He threw it to Harruq, who managed to catch it even though his mouth hung wide open.
 “The first Horde War was caused by a disciple of mine,” the man in black explained.
 “He blessed the armor of one of the leaders of the orcish clans.
 I claimed it when he fell on the battlefield.”
 Harruq examined the suit, turning it over in his hands.
 It was composed of many interwoven straps of thick leather.
 Obsidian buckles and clamps held the pieces together.
 The only color was a yellow scorpion emblazoned on the chest.
 “Why the scorpion?” he asked.

 Next he went over the dresser.
 Rodregas had known that the physical essence of the celestial lion was in his body and that all of his physical attributes would be improved, but the strength of the Immortalist was not common knowledge; you just heard that they were long lived and never got sick.
 They used magic against their foes not swords, and they seldom got involved in physical struggles.
 Of course Rodregas had known that in The Immortal Guard of the Guild the most loyal and powerful of their officers were given enhanced bodies, but he thought their power lay in their magical sigils.
 His new body was very large and very muscular, and much stronger than he would have guessed.
 Rodregas lifted his right arm and curled it into a tight muscle.
 He felt the biceps with his free hand.
 The texture under the skin felt like bundles of large, powerful cables.
 He felt his face break into a smile; he had seen this face smile when it had been a prisoner.

I had fallen asleep looking at my mother’s pendant, trying to remember her, and somehow combined it with the disaster I had read of the northern clans.
 It was only a dream.
 Shaken, I sat up, struggling to collect myself.
 I reached up to remove the pendant from the hook and squeezed it tight in my fist.
 It felt good, like a connection, and I slid the leather chain over my head, pulling the pendant down to rest on my chest.
 It felt right there and I knew I should have been wearing it all along.
 As I let go, I realized I’d gotten blood on my hands, so I headed to the hall and poured water from the pitcher into a ceramic basin.
 Staring into the mirror was not my favorite pastime.
 It mostly made my head hurt.
 But I had to clean the blood from my face and straighten the nest of hair on my head.

Small gusts of air rolled off the dragon’s wings that blew Emily’s hair in her face.
 I smiled as she raked the pink strands out of her mouth.
 We dipped down and I felt the “stomach-in-your-chest” feeling you usually get from rollercoasters.
 I closed my eyes and tried to ignore it but I couldn’t.
 I hated this feeling just as much as I hated puking, and the chills that liked to run up my spine at random times.
 Then all of a sudden, the dragon stopped.
 My eyes opened in horror as I saw the small trickle of blood fall from a hole in the right wing.
 Then we started to fall.

My world started trembling as I turned my test over and saw an 'F' at the top of the page.
 'Come see me after class.'
 The note felt like the final nail in the coffin of my academic future.
 My efforts to focus were entirely wasted.
 It took everything I had just to hold myself together until class ended.
 I'd planned on remaining in my seat until everyone else left, but Mrs. Tiggs motioned me to her desk while half the class was still filing out the door.
 "It gives me no pleasure to tell you this, but based on your initial test score I think you should prepare yourself for the fact that you're probably going to fail this class.
 I worried this would be the result of your starting so late in the semester and not having any prior Spanish experience.
 Unfortunately, it's now too late for you to switch into another class.
 I'm afraid you'll just have to take the failing grade."

 A sharp pain in his gut dragged Harruq from his dreams.
 He lifted open a single eye and glared at the blurry image of his brother.
 “The sun is almost up,” Qurrah said, kicking him again.
 “You need to be as well.”
 “What are you…‌awww, damn it.”
 He sat up straight and shook his head, trying to clear the fuzz that clogged the vast empty space between his ears.
 Qurrah helped by offering a third kick, this one right to the kidney.
 Harruq gasped and staggered to his feet.

She sighed with relief.
 “Oh, Frey.” I was suddenly surrounded and the sight made my head spin.
 I closed my eyes tight in an attempt to stop it.
 “Get her a drink,” someone commanded.
 I felt the hand in mine then, as it was pulled away, replaced with a glass.
 I grimaced; I doubted I could hold a glass up, let alone myself.
 “Don’t worry, it’s only water,” someone reassured me.
 At the word, I realized I was parched, bone dry.
 I forced myself up, keeping my eyes tight as I concentrated on getting the glass to my lips.

Possibly that was his plan.
 If she'd totally abandoned him then her children would've all died."
 I felt my eyelids begin to flutter, as my breathing slowed to match Alec's.
 "Whether that was his intent or not, the Sun didn't completely abandon him, either out of respect for what they'd shared, or possibly out of concern for her children.
 Once it became apparent that the Earth and Sun were through with each other, the Moon began to court her.
 Doomed to touch only briefly during the rare solar eclipses, they nevertheless became beloved, one to the other.
 The greatest sign of the Moon's devotion to the Sun came about when he sent his children down to the Earth to watch over and protect the sunborn, or dayborn as they are most often called."
 Alec's pause was long enough that I think I nodded off, but the sound of his voice once he resumed talking pulled me back awake.
 "Originally there were just two of the moonborn, a pair of brothers called Adjam and Inock.
 Unbeknown to the Moon, the Earth had anticipated his great gesture of love, and sent forth a plague upon the land.

They could no longer cower within them and hope to be spared.
 In the commotion, Qurrah vanished, unseen and uncared for.
 He had spent his whole life disappearing in crowds, and in the dark of night, surrounded by fear and worry, he was just a shadow.

 Qurrah was in no hurry as he left the city behind.
 The grass was soft and tall, and it felt good under his feet after so much sprinting down stone roads.
 Stars filled the sky, and he smiled to them often.
 In the distance, he spotted a small fire, and he knew to whom it belonged.
 “Where is your brother?” Velixar asked as Qurrah approached.

In his mind’s eye, he saw Velixar.
 The old prophet warned of death, retribution, and pain, but Harruq silenced him.
 Let the gift be gone.
 He denied the darkness within him.
 If this was betrayal, then so be it.
 He would pay the cost.
 Great spasms racked his body.
 All the power Velixar had granted him fled.
 His muscles shrank inward, tightening in great, painful shudders.
 Several minutes passed as the horrendous pain tore through his arms, chest, and legs.

You freaked out before,” he asked, his voice full of concern.
 I nodded and answered shakily, “You know that I hate falling.
 You must have been scared too.” He hesitated.
 “Yes, I was, but I think I was more concerned that you would wake the dead with your screams and they would attack us too.” I smacked him lightly on the arm and laid down next to him.
 I stared at the sky.
 “So where are we?” “Well, our winged friend managed to get us out of the woods and near the mountains.
 You can see them over there.” He pointed off in the distance and I spotted the mountains towering above everything else.
 “That’s good, at least all of this wasn’t for nothing.” He sighed and closed his eyes.
 “Yes, I didn't lose my hearing for nothing, because I had to listen to you scream.” “Are you ever going to drop that?” I asked.

“I would encourage you to be careful on your trip over.
 You did hear about what happened to Ravenhurr?” asked Taiga.
 Van’dret almost felt his eye brows rise, “of course, but what should I watch out for?
 I heard it was just some sort of accident.
 I was not aware that any of the Knights of the Order were implicated.” Taiga smiled and waved a hand in a dismissing motion.
 “Oh, don’t misjudge my words.
 I did not mean to imply any misdeeds of our valiant Knights of the Soaring Heavens.
 I am not aware of any of them doing much of anything, much less kill an Immortalist.” “Than what should I keep my eye out for?” asked Van’dret.
 He was becoming even more curious to the direction of the conversation.
 “You, my fine Van’dret, are more in the world than most of us.

 Then we started to fall.
 Chapter 9
 I screamed so loud that my ears felt like they were going to pop.
 We plummeted to the ground, falling closer and closer… Oh man, I thought and closed my eyes.
 Don’t look, don’t look, don’t look… “Really!” Seth yelled at the sky.
 “This brings new meaning to ‘things can’t get any worse!’” I gripped furiously to the limp dragon.
 I was falling to my death: so this is how it was going to end.
 I never pictured it this way; I thought I would die a little more heroically, not screaming like a little girl.
 “Not now Seth,” Emily screamed at him.

The essence of shock therapy is a reliance on macro-economic factors to bring about a radical restructuring of the economy and a radical change in the behaviour of individuals and enterprises.
 While monetary policy may prove useful for dealing with short-term adjustment problems within a relatively stable environment, there is no evidence to support its use as the principle instrument for social transition.
 Monetary variables are indicators of the functioning of an economy, but the essential factors which determine the strength and health of an economy are the productivity of its enterprises and its workforce and the material resources of the country.
 Tight monetary policy can generate intense short-term pressure for change in behaviour, but this pressure is applied indiscriminately and often with unexpected and unanticipated results.
 The primary result of premature liberalization of prices was to encourage trade and speculation while discouraging production and investment.
 It distracted attention from fundamental changes in institutions and social attitudes needed for the transition to be successful.
 Macro-level policy measures have to be complemented and supported by parallel micro-level efforts to educate the population about the new economic system, to generate a free flow of information – not just freedom, but the actual exchange of information, which is still severely limited in these countries – to develop new distribution systems, to impart appropriate business and managerial skills, to provide access to credit, to build up new social institutions and to en courage and promote new enterprises.
 In most cities of the former Soviet Union, for instance, there is not a single whole sale market for food.
 There are no systems for consumer credit, no agencies in charge of promoting small business development.
 In the absence of these and other essential micro-level conditions, even the right macro-level strategy will not evoke the anticipated response.

“In time,” she said.
 “I have met him only once, but I doubt there are any like him.
 Stay quiet and be patient.”
 Her mind was a net, and she cast it further and further out, scanning the rolling hills and the plains beyond.
 “Found him,” she whispered.

 A blue portal ripped through the air before Qurrah, beckoning him.
 He looked through but saw only mists and distorted landscape.
 Seeing nothing to lose, he got to his feet and stepped inside.

 CM:  	That’s not on any album, is it?
 BG:  	No.
 I’m thinking about reviving it.
 Because it was never really a Black Lung song.
 It was more personal, a statement of a kind.

The same is true for information, technology, training, transport and other factors.
 Increasing the speed of dissemination of information and new technology can accelerate the creation of new businesses and new jobs.
 In many developing countries, inefficient bureaucracies are slow to take decisions, issue licences, review applications, sanction loans, and amend legislation.
 This inefficiency directly impacts on the pace of development.
 Streamlining and expediting decision making and the movement of other social resources is a highly effective strategy for spurring development.
 Comparative scales need to be created to measure the movement of each of these social forces within and between nations.
 Strategies can be evolved to stimulate more rapid overall development by directly acting to increase the velocity of these forces up to ten-fold or even more.
 Progressive Attitudes
 The world we live in today is an external expression of our inner attitudes.
 The world we aspire towards can be realized only by acquiring the attitudes corresponding to those achievements.

 Britney rolled her eyes as she went to her assigned desk, but I suspected she was actually relieved we'd been split up.
 Mrs. Campbell didn't seem like the kind of teacher you could get away with ignoring, so I retrieved an algebra book from the back of the room and sat at my desk.
 Any thoughts about finding out why hiking was off limits quickly melted away once class started.
 Math had never been my favorite subject.
 I'd always managed to pull A's or at least A-'s, but hated all of the little nitpicky rules.
 Unfortunately, after missing a whole month of classes, I was at least as bad off in Algebra as I was in Biology.

Somehow I willed myself to stick it out at school despite my surroundings and the influences of my peers.
 I don’t know what it was that enabled me to do this, to not fall entirely into the wasteland of addiction and entitlement.
 Biology?
 Character?
 It’s inexplicable, really.
 All of my roommates had dropped out of high school but somehow I continued; although my grades sucked, they were passing grades.
 In my senior year I only took classes until noon because that is all I needed to graduate.
 I got another job at a local restaurant for the lunch shift as well as any days I was off from the grocery store.
 I realized at an early age that nobody was going to give me anything and if I wanted something I would need to earn it.
 If I didn’t succeed, I wouldn’t survive!

Most of the time it just means they're faster and stronger than me.
 That they can heal from things that would kill me almost instantly.
 Sometimes though, the other side of their nature shows through."
 I felt my heart speed up as Rachel met my eyes with more gravity even than normal.
 "They aren't always completely in control, Adri.
 They try, and some of them are really good.
 Alec is probably the most controlled person I've ever met, and Isaac is so disciplined he's almost immune to the power plays.
 Even so, sometimes it's like they operate on a shorter fuse than the rest of us."
 My throat was so dry it took me two attempts to clear it.
 "Could Alec have won?"

Rodregas thought he saw other movement as well, farther out, but it was more animal-like.
 He was surprised any wild animals would be this close to the noise of a fight.
 Rodregas waited for an opening, but it was hard to know exactly what was going on in the dark.
 He was bleeding from his belly wound, and decided that he could not wait.
 Rodregas decided to pull his short swords from the harness on his side and, at the same time, rush in on the big guy.
 The large attacker was big and powerful, but his rake had shattered and Rodregas had his short swords on his harness.
 His attacker appeared to not have a back up weapon.
 Then a voice rang out, “Stop, STOP, it is not him!
 It is not the Sorcerer Ravenhurr.” It was a woman’s voice.
 Then a much deeper voice, one that seemed half growl, responded, “She is right.

"Oh, it's perfect, Adri.

 I avoided looking at the mirror.
 It seemed like a crime to defile such a pretty dress, and I wanted to remember it like it had looked on the hanger, all shimmery and wispy.
 I did risk a look down at the price tag.
 My heart actually skipped a beat.
 That was more than some people spent on their first car.
 "Rachel, you've already bought me way too much.
 I can't let you get this.
 Not only will I never wear it, you could practically feed small countries with what you'd have to pay for all this."

A snicker slipped from Steed and Anvil glanced at him before amending, “Well, that is where they cut out part of my tongue.” I recoiled, wrenching my hand from his.
 The tingle remained.
 He didn’t seem offended; he simply took a few steps backward to start his demonstration.
 I brought my arm back to my side and it brushed Ruby, shocking her just enough to make both of us flinch.
 She only smiled as she returned her attention to the start of the show.
 The other men drew back, some sitting, some standing, but all giving him their full attention and space as he raised his hands and braced himself, taking one full deep breath before shifting forward, ever so slightly.
 A thunderous crack and excruciating light flew from both of his outstretched hands, slammed into a tall pine, and snapped the top third of the tree off.
 Several limbs splintered and popped as it crashed its way down.
 I stared in open-mouthed astonishment.
 Sweat glistened on the large man’s forehead and his breath was a little labored, but still, he stood.

My eyes batted open and I was lying on the ground, looking up at Junnie and Chevelle.
 Junnie’s words ran together as Chevelle mumbled.
 “Gian Zet Foria Gian Zet Foria Gian Zet Foria.” It seemed so familiar.
 Like Georgiana, Suzetta, Glaforia.
 They stopped simultaneously.
 “Frey.” Junnie was talking slowly.
 “Stay calm and lie still.” I tried to convey my incredulity as I lay there, unable to move.
 “Explain to me what happened.” All the anger and excitement turned numb.
 What came out sounded no more than a statement of fact.
 “Chevelle held me back and made me watch my mother die.” Junnie didn’t have the outraged look I expected.

“What should I do?” A sly grin crossed his face and he rolled his hand out in front of him.
 “You are only limited by your imagination, Freya.” Great, so if I screwed up it was just a problem with my mind.
 I considered that, recalling what Steed had said about feeling it, thinking about what you wanted to happen.
 But what did I want to happen?
 I had to catch that line of thought before it spiraled out of control; I concentrated on finding something small.
 A tiny pebble lay on the ground at my feet.
 I focused on it hard, willing it to rise.
 When nothing happened I looked for Chevelle’s reaction.
 He watched me, his serene mask back in place.
 “Do you need motivation?” I was afraid of the kind of motivation he’d provide, remembering the fireballs flying at me in the meadow.

 He handed it to her.
 "Comb your hair as you blow it--that'll make it dry faster.
 And this is how you turn it off.
 I'm going to go make breakfast.
 Come down when you're ready."
 The hot air felt good, and it was making her hair fluffy.
 Unfortunately, she didn't have any curling tongs, and her too-long hair, now perfectly straight, hung past her shoulders.
 With a sigh, she parted her hair in the middle and went downstairs.
 "Hair all dry?"

What about you?” “Well,” she said thoughtfully, “I was thinking about Kojas-” “Emily don’t say his name, I don’t feel like being yelled at again.” I interrupted her.
 “Fine,” she said, a little annoyed.
 “I was thinking about him, if I must call him that, and what he’s like.” I rolled my eyes.
 “Emily isn’t it obvious; he’s evil for crying out loud.
 That’s why we have to go and stop him.” “I know that Jazell, gosh, but I was wondering what he looks like.” “I don’t want to know,” I said.
 Emily twirled her hair, “I know but I’m just curious.” I bit my lip.
 “If we do end up fighting this guy, you’ll get your wish.” Minutes later, Jason emerged from the trees and dropped his travel bag on the ground.
 He leaned against the statue next to Emily, giving us both feeble smiles.
 “So,” he said, trying to sound happy, “travel day today, huh?” We didn’t answer.
 “Okay looks like I’ll do the talking,” Jason said.

 Far from town, a blue portal tore open above empty grass.
 The big half-orc tumbled out, followed by a flustered Aurelia.
 Upon her exit, the portal closed, swirling away as if it had never existed.
 Harruq groaned, spitting out dirt that had made its way into his mouth.
 “Where are we?” he asked.
 “About two miles east of Woodhaven,” she told him.

Harruq cut him again and again.
 His arms, his chest, his face: it all bled.
 But he remained alive, at least until that final moment when the two magic blades scissor-cut his neck.

Dire Cats are smarter than regular lions; they might see you as an ally or part of their herd.
 No wait, I think with cats you call them prides.
 But I wonder how they see Doi’van and me?” she asked.
 Neither Doi’van nor Rodregas had an answer to that question.
 “Well,” Rodregas said, “we need to find shelter and if they meant us harm us they would not have shown themselves.
 It’s getting dark.
 Let’s get the horses into the barn.
 If they have been tracking me since I let them out, they don’t seem to want to do any great harm.” With that Rodregas got out of the wagon and started to pull the horses into the barn.
 Their noses were flaring, and he had to pull them almost to the opening.
 As soon as they got close they both went charging in; they sensed the barn was shelter to keep them safe from the Dire Cats.

Again I found myself hoping nobody would recognize me or my son’s name plastered for all to see on the hearings notice sheet attached to the courtroom door.
 These fatherly duties seemed minimal after what I had already done and I was happy to do this because he was getting the help he needed.
 I was still humiliated to be there and to see my last name on the court docket clipboard.
 Easter weekend, Lisa, Bryce and I drove over eight hours drive towards Temecula, California, then over a rural road through a desert valley to Werner Springs.
 There was no mistaking our destination when we spotted it.
 It looked like the recreation yard in the film One Flew Over the Coo Coo’s Nest, as people milled about, stopping and turning to look at us as we entered the parking lot.
 The facility itself might have been a roadside migrant worker motel.
 People were roaming around the grounds doing everything from raking leaves to just hanging in groups, but each one stopped what they were doing to examine us as we drove in.
 We could immediately tell that visitors to this desolate location were rare.
 Brandon approached the vehicle with enthusiasm and the brightest broadest smile we have ever seen on his face.

But contrary to popular conception and empirical observation, there is little evidence to support the thesis that technological development is responsible for rising levels of unemployment in the medium to long term.
 In spite of widespread anxiety that machines are progressively replacing people in the workforce, historically there has been a strong positive correlation between technological development and job creation.
 It is certainly the case that the commercial application of each new phase of productive technologies displaces people from traditional occupations, reduces the number of workers required to carry out specific tasks, and can in the short term lead to fewer jobs in specific industries.
 In the process, a larger number of low-wage, unskilled jobs are replaced with a smaller number of higher-wage, more skilled jobs resulting in rising levels of worker productivity and rising personal incomes.
 But that is only the most direct initial impact of improved technology.
 Seen from a wider perspective and traced patiently along the course of its myriad consequences, the introduction of new technology acts as a catalyst that generates a positive ripple effect which, on average, results in the creation of many more jobs – more skilled, more productive and higher-wage jobs – than it destroys.
 The rising productivity made possible by technology reduces production costs and thereby lowers the price of products and services to customers and consumers.
 The lower prices result in increased demand, greater consumption, higher levels of production and even greater cost reductions due to economies of scale.
 This represents only the first cycle of job creation.
 While jobs are being eliminated in low-skilled manual or assembly operations, simultaneously they are being created in industries that manufacture and service the more sophisticated machines, as well as in Research and Development (R &D) laboratories that develop the new machines, materials and manufacturing processes.

 I shoved it back in my pocket and continued walking.
 The sun was almost gone and shadows were starting to appear behind everything.
 I looked at my own shadow, that danced behind me.
 The phone buzzed again as Seth sent me a reply.
 See anything?
 Do you want me to meet you?
 I glanced at the nearby woods.
 My ears heard nothing and I didn’t see any movement but my hands shook slightly as I typed, Nothing, I’m fine.
 I didn’t open his reply because I knew what it would say.

I nodded, and managed a fairly convincing smile.
 "Okay, then.
 Well there's a present for you in the living room, but since you didn't want to celebrate until after school, you'll have to wait to open it."
 I could definitely hear the rumble of a high-performance engine.
 I nodded again, and turned to go, hopeful that I could avoid the inevitable question of why Brandon was coming to pick me up in the mornings as well as dropping me off most afternoons.
 Unfortunately, Mom's hearing was nearly as good as mine, and she was walking towards the windows before I managed to get the door open.
 "Adri, who's that?"
 It was obviously one of those leading questions designed to see whether or not I'd try to lie.
 I shrugged.
 "His name is Brandon; he picks me up sometimes in the morning."

Each piece opened up another fragment of my soul, revealing a new pain that I'd kept hidden for the last few months.
 The last picture was next to a door, which I opened almost without realizing I was doing so.
 The organized confusion of a true artist met my gaze.
 I'd seen it with my mom, when she was so driven to complete a shot that she couldn't be bothered to clean up after herself.
 She left just enough structure to the mess to find needed tools, but didn't waste any effort on anything that wouldn't help her with her great aim.
 Brushes were scattered everywhere, old and new canvases stacked in the corners of the studio, and flecks of paint had found their way onto almost every visible surface.
 The rich smell of paint was nearly overpowering, but I noticed it only in passing as I made a beeline towards the easel that dominated the center of the space.
 The painting was still wet, right down to the signature which had been done in the palest green.
 The scene was from the point of view of someone looking into a bedroom window, darker than most of the later stuff I'd just looked at.
 The centerpiece, done in a dimmer light than what I remembered from my dreams, was the sleeping figure.

“Grand Marshal, you are not really thinking of knighting this fiend, are you?
 He killed a fellow squire out there.
 And he consorts with Nymphs and Infernals, not people of the Celestial Realm.
 You do the Order a disservice to make him a Knight of the Soaring Heavens.” Van’dret’s voice was slow and reasonable sounding and he spoke not so much to the Grand Marshal as to the audience.
 “I but follow the rules of the Order as they have stood for unknown centuries, Ambassador.
 While there are many things that go into raising a squire to knighthood, the tournament is the exception.
 The rules are simple; win and you win knighthood.
 While undue bloodshed can disqualify you, a single death during the tournament is not unusual.” While the Grand Marshal spoke, he did not look at the audience.
 He looked at Van’dret and he did not look happy at the interruption.
 “But clearly he already has a greater sigil; no man can fight like that who does not have one.

"I am.
 Thank you, Rick."
 He swallowed, his eyes locked on her face.
 "Do you know how incredibly beautiful you are?"
 "I'm a mess."
 "No.
 You're beautiful."
 She lowered her eyes.
 "Thank you."
 Rick tilted her chin up, making her meet his eyes.

Then he asked if we were against Kojas and I said yes, that he was hunting us.
 Then he told me that he would let us use his cave because he was on our side.
 Then I thanked him and here we are, inside the cave nice and dry.” “Maybe that's your power, you can speak to dragons,” Seth suggested.
 “But I don't understand how you two get powers and we don't.” “Be patient,” I said.
 “Yes,” Emily murmured and stifled a yawn.
 “Girls first, Seth.
 Have a problem with that?” “All right then,” he said and leaned against the wall.
 “Sweet dreams to you two.” “Yup sweet dreams to us,” I said and closed my eyes.
 “Goodnight Emily.” “Goodnight Jazell.” I drifted off, feeling surprising comfy against Seth's shoulder and hearing Jason softy snore.
 I opened my eyes to see myself standing in the woods.

"How would you feel about inviting my sister and her boyfriend for dinner one evening this week?"
 he asked as he walked her back to the house.
 Last night it had occurred to him that she might feel more inclined to stay in 2011 if she had friends here.
 "All right."
 She looked up at him.
 "Are you going to tell her about me?"
 "What do you mean?"
 "Are you going to tell her I'm from 1927?"
 "Are you kidding?
 She’d think I’d lost my mind.

His thoughts had traveled in a similar direction.
 “I have been thinking about what you said about it making sense for me to get a greater sigil.
 I have more magic than I need.
 There is only one other group besides the Guild that has is allowed to give sigils, the Knights of the Soaring Heavens; from who the Gods choose their champions.” Imeralda and Doi’van had both become quite intrigued by what Rodregas was hinting at.
 He continued, “I was a squire in the Knighthood who was never raised.
 As you probably know most squires are not raised, only those of the most noble blood and those of greatest talent in both magic and the arts of a warrior.
 I was neither.
 I had thought that I would make a career in the army,” he paused after admitting that.
 His time as a squire was like magic to him, and his time in the army had been a living nightmare.
 “Once a year directly after the new group of knights is raised, a great competition is held; a five days open tournament.

Granted that a consensus is reached regarding these larger issues of principle, there still will remain immense problems relating to implementation, as illustrated by the recent failure of international intervention in Somalia.
 Whatever may be the limits placed on the UN’s mandate for action, it is clear that it cannot carry out that mandate effectively under the current constraints imposed on it by member states through indecisiveness, narrowly defined interests and lack of political commitment.
 Once again the inherent weaknesses in the structure of the UN organization impact negatively on its capacity to perform the tasks rightfully allotted to it.
 The absence of a unified chain of command for national forces placed under UN command – culminating in the outright refusal of field forces to follow the commands of UN field staff, inadequate training and equipping of both military staff and fighting units, poor coordination between field units from different countries and between member states and UN headquarters – and a failure to vest sufficient authority in the UN Secretary General are among the most blatant weaknesses of the present system.
 Substantive measures are needed to strengthen the UN’s capabilities to handle crises.
 First and foremost, the position of the Secretary General, who now has the diplomatic status equal to that of a prime minister of a member state, should be upgraded to that of a head of state, with full authority over the forces placed under his command by member states to carry out the decisions of the Security Council.
 Problems of control over the armed forces of member states argue for the constitution of a standing international military force, as described in the previous section of this report.
 Lesser measures can be implemented immediately, such as provision of appropriate training to UN Secretariat personnel responsible for conflict prevention, expanding the staff of the Department of Political Affairs, and establishment by the UN of its own independent international surveillance capability, including a satellite system to monitor its work worldwide.
 Meanwhile, advanced computer, satellite and communications technology should be made available to the Secretariat by member states.
 A comprehensive system is needed to monitor military movements.

“You lied to Emily?
 She’s going kill you.” He smiled faintly.
 “She doesn’t need to know.” “So a dwarf told you something?
 Why didn’t you tell us?” I asked.
 Seth looked away.
 “It didn’t actually include you or anyone else, so I didn't say anything.” He paused.
 “They said that I would betray you all and be Kojas' servant.
 I would be the key to the downfall of Igneeria.
 I don't know what to do Jazell; I don't even know if those things are true.
 They won't attack me and I swear, if you gave them a minute, I bet they would help me.” He was talking so fast the words almost blurred together.

 Case closed.

Her body was everything that he had thought it would be, both wonderfully hard and lush.
 To say she was the most beautiful woman he had ever enjoyed touching was a ridiculous understatement.
 Imeralda reached up to his neck and pulled herself up on top of his lap.
 She wrapped her legs around him and hoisted herself up like she was climbing the trunk of a tree.
 He had wanted to take his time and explore her with his hands and lips, but clearly she was in no mood for foreplay.
 Rodregas in turn was in no mood to stop her now that his own passion was building, and there was no reason to think that they would not be repeating this experience.
 There would be other times to explore her.
 Now was time to give in to their most primal needs.
 For one last moment he held her back, slowing her movements.
 He was a little worried that she would have trouble handling his size, but she literally started bouncing on his lap and his own groans joined hers and he stopped thinking and gave himself to the pleasure of the moment.

Well, shit, I thought, ok, yeah.
 I can dig this chick, because I mean, she had this body, well, the kind you dream about.
 And she was this novelist’s daughter and so she was cool and kind of bohemian and had this apartment in Midtown, upper floor, with a nice view of Poplar.
 So, I just showed up there one evening.
 And, you won’t believe this, but she was just out of the shower and was wearing nothing but a bathrobe.
 And her skin was glistening with dampness.
 I thought I had stumbled into heaven, man.
 I thought, nothing is gonna be easier than falling into bed with this beautiful woman.
 So, after some awkward small talk—and keep in mind, she didn’t go get dressed—I made a move.
 I think I just sort of leaned in to kiss her.

He couldn't help smiling as he rubbed his eyes sleepily.
 She was so excited about everything.
 He'd better not let her have tea before she got behind the wheel.
 "OK, I turn the key, right?"
 she said, almost quivering with excitement as she slid behind the wheel.
 "Yeah, but take a minute to calm down.
 Take a deep breath."
 He covered her hand with his, smiling.
 "Now turn the key until you hear the car start and then let go."
 She turned it and let go as soon as she heard a noise.

He went over to the glass enclosed shelves; the books looked richly made but old.
 Books of sorcery would sell very well indeed.
 The glass covers were locked, so again he muffled the sound with the blanket and forced the cabinet doors open.
 With each cabinet door the glass broke.
 He tried to open the cabinet doors without breaking the glass.
 But, whatever magic locks were in force were just too secure.
 So, he had to use brute strength to shatter the doors one by one.
 Several of the books fell during his struggles with the cabinet.
 Rodregas reached down and grabbed a couple of them, and then dropped them right back to the ground in shock as evil licked his hand.
 He shook the feeling off his hand and went back to the water closet and washed it in the water basin.

And his obsession with marriage increased tenfold.
 I had not met his family, but one morning when I arrived at the patch of forest where we met, he proudly presented his mother’s wedding gown, a gift for me.
 He wanted me to wear it in our ceremony.
 I had never agreed to the union, but I avoided telling him it was not possible.
 It would be only valid in his mind.
 But then again, what would that hurt?
 I accepted the dress from him, looking it over.
 It was poorly made and ill-fitting, but had potential as a design.
 I sat, using magic to work on the seaming and arrange the pearl strands and beading in a more pleasant pattern while deciding how best to deal with him.
 He was watching me intently.

"So what does a seventeen-year-old shape shifter spend his time doing?"
 I succeeded with my goal of making him laugh.
 "Well, I spend a ridiculous amount of time trying to keep my friends away from each other's throats.
 We've got some pretty strong personalities, and it's nearly a full-time job stopping minor disagreements from boiling over into something bigger.
 Apart from that, I spend an hour or two every day vetting Donovan's management of the family assets.
 He does an incredible job with everything, but even so, there are certain things I have to approve myself."
 "Who's Donovan?"
 Another chuckle.
 "That's one of the most difficult questions you've asked so far.
 He likes to call himself our butler, but that doesn't even begin to describe him.

 The tears began flowing faster down her cheeks.

 "Yes--no."
 She looked up at him, sliding her hands into his.

He was not sure how to feel, like a pleased father giving out mid-winter gifts to children, or like a young lover giving flowers to a new crush.
 Rodregas was unsure which reaction was proper now, and which she would want him to feel.
 Doi’van had watched the whole show with the thoughtful expression that he was starting to believe was his normal face to the world.
 “And do you have a full suit of Night Bronze Plate Mail for me and a magic sword or three as well?” he asked in his careful voice.
 “I am afraid that if we want any proper armor for ourselves we are going to have to take it off some Immortal Guard’s corpse.
 But I do have one other Black Yew bow and a bigger sword that probably makes more sense for you to use than me, since I have used nothing but short swords for a very long time.” Rodregas then pulled out the two-handed great sword that he had found at the keep and handed it to Doi’van.
 On Doi’van it was more a hand and a half sword, but as he flourished it around a bit, Rodregas could see he was pleased.
 “The steel is simple, but the balance is good.
 I am starting to be very happy that I helped pull this wagon up the hill,” he said with a deep chuckle, which sounded like distant thunder.
 Rodregas nodded and said, “I am afraid other than a few items to sell everything else is food and blankets for us... and the horses and tools that I stripped out of the Raven Keep.

There were only about twenty Ravenhurr guardsmen.
 If they were sent in every possible direction, especially in pairs, there was a good chance that he would come across no more than two of them at a time.
 If they were still confused about whether he was or was not Ravenhurr, he would have an excellent chance of overcoming them.
 On the other hand, if the forces of the guild came after him… The guardsmen of the Immortalist guild were known as the Immortal Guards and their reputation as the premier fighters of the realm was seldom questioned.
 If they found out what had happened at Raven Keep there was not much chance for Rodregas’ survival.
 After a simple meal, a good rub down for the horses and a few hours of rest, Rodregas got the wagon back on the road.
 If he could keep up this pace, up he could be well hidden before any forces could find him.
 At the end of the second day, before he had come to his last turn off, he realized that he would have to get some sleep.
 He was feeling exhausted.
 His body might be surprisingly strong and quick but apparently it still needed to sleep on a regular basis.

But, I did think—I do think—that we had to stand for something other than pop ditties, you dig?
 The people who needed help—well, it was all so fucking clear then—AIM and the draft dodgers and the blacks and, Jesus, I mean, if you couldn’t see the problem you really were part of the problem.
 So, seeing it, what does one do?
 What could one do?
 Power, in the end, is just another word, too, but the power is gonna belong to someone, so, in the end, who decides?
 Who decides Nixon has more power than Mao, or John Lennon has more power than Roy Cohn?
 You dig?
 I was wrestling with these things, absurd things, but I couldn’t see clearly.
 All I saw was blackness, the blackness of dried blood.

Rodregas sensed that the Knight Captain was not happy with what had happened, but he said no word of apology.
 As the three were led away, Rodregas asked the boy the name of the sorcerer at the table.
 “That is the Immortalist Van’dret, Ambassador to the Knights from the Guild.
 He is very powerful you know.
 We are told to do whatever he commands, but also told to stay as far away from him as possible,” said the young boy, who could not have been much more than twelve years old.
 Rodregas nodded and said, “Sounds like good advice.” Rodregas looked up as Doi’van and Imeralda entered the room.
 Doi’van looked grim.
 But as Rodregas assumed no one had died, he had to smile.
 “Is it that bad?” he asked.
 Doi’van missed his amused tone, or he was simply not in the mood to hear it.

I pressed, taking the chance.
 “Why?” I heard movement behind me and the fear returned tenfold.
 Chevelle didn’t tense; he only let out an exasperated breath.
 “It’s fine,” he said.
 He released me and I turned to see who he’d addressed.
 Four figures stood in a line, almost a formation, and they relaxed at his words.
 My arm tingled as the blood returned to the limb, freed of his harsh grip.
 Yes, he hates me.
 I flexed my fist.
 “Ah, she escaped,” Ruby purred.

You are beautiful."
 I waited for the inevitable joke, or backhanded compliment to follow, but he seemed happy to just stop there.
 For once in my life I managed to be smart and do the same.
 "So what's the agenda for today?"
 Alec stretched and then shrugged.
 "School, just like every Monday."
 My groan brought a smile to his face.
 "I can ship pesky parents out of the country, but if you start a wholesale program of cutting class your mom will find out when she gets back."
 "So I just go about my day like normal, pretending like I don't know Brandon's a psychopath who just happens to be able to change shapes at will and rip big holes in brick walls?"
 I finally rolled out of bed, and started picking through the pile of bags from our shopping trip, hoping to find something that wouldn't make it look like I'd just won the lottery or robbed a bank.

When Britney stomped over and asked if I was done, I considered telling her I needed ten more minutes.
 Her being an attention hog didn't justify me being petty though.
 I just nodded instead and packed up my stuff.
 The ride home was completely uneventful, and mercifully brief.
 Britney was one of those people who drive fast normally, and even faster when they are pissed off.
 Apparently having to stay after school to study merited twenty-five over the speed limit.
 I normally would have complained--I'd become much more sensitive about speeding in the last couple of months, but I was anxious to get home, and very much not feeling like there was anything particularly special to live for.
 Not that I was suicidal, contrary to Mom's unvoiced, but obvious fears.
 I just didn't have much of anything to look forward to.
 It wasn't until Britney's Saturn was nearly out of sight that I realized our Jeep Cherokee was parked in the driveway.

It can mark a decisive transition or staging ground for speeding humanity’s evolutionary progression.
 The remarkable events of the past few years – the fall of the Berlin Wall, the turn to democracy in the former USSR and other countries of Eastern Europe, the peaceful end of apartheid in South Africa, and concrete steps toward lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians – confirm this truth.
 In an age of incredibly rapid and revolutionary change, who can confidently claim the wisdom to predict what can or cannot be accomplished in the coming decade?
 Looking back on this moment ten years from now, we may well be able to chronicle what now appear as equally extraordinary achievements.
 The glimpse of possible changes in the world over the next decade afforded in the box on pages 7–8 may appear outlandish and unrealistic to some.
 It is an indication of what is possible, not a prophecy or projection of what is inevitable.
 It presents a set of real opportunities that can be tapped, provided that we take best advantage of the present situation.
 The progress it heralds is no more inconceivable and remarkable than the chain of recent achievements seemed seven years ago – yet those we have already come to take for granted and, underinsistent prodding by the media, to replace in our consciousness with ever new concerns.

Only he chose trust his father’s will above his own, which was limited by his humanity, as ours is, in spades.
 Maybe twice, at least, Eric chose to die for me.
 Still, because Eric didn’t create himself, to worship him would be like praising Hamlet rather than Shakespeare.
 Besides, if Eric died for me, it probably wasn’t the human in him, but the Christ.
 So I will take care not to worship Eric, only adore him.
 I wonder if I have been stricken by acute anthropomorphism.
 Maybe I should give up watching my Joan of Arcadia CD collection.

 Art – Last I had heard they hadn’t decided on a name.
 Yes this is Elizabeth Struan’s show, assuming that is what you’re looking for.

It’s got that “Green River” riff to it, a chugging thing, even though it’s acoustic, it sounds like a freight train, don’t you think?
 CM:  	Ok, uh, “If You Push Your Belly Button your Legs Fall Off.”  Many critics said this was like a children’s song.
 Like “Mary Had a Little Lamb.” Consciously so?
 BG:  	A children’s song?
 Shit.
 No.
 It’s about being in bed with a new woman.
 It’s about that moment of intimacy after you’ve spent each other, that time when you’re running your fingers over each other’s bodies, asking about little nooks and crannies, scars and tattoos.
 I said this to a woman—the “white swan woman” in the song—after our first intercourse.
 I said to her, “If you push your belly button…” and she laughed long and hard.

“Can you find him?” Harruq asked her, realizing what she was doing.
 He sat on his rear and began readjusting his armor to his more slender frame.
 “In time,” she said.
 “I have met him only once, but I doubt there are any like him.
 Stay quiet and be patient.”
 Her mind was a net, and she cast it further and further out, scanning the rolling hills and the plains beyond.
 “Found him,” she whispered.

I was sitting at the bar with Bill, just a twenty-two year old kid, when a vision walked in.
 She stopped just a few steps inside the door.
 She wore purple high waist pants and a cream colored blouse that went all the way to her neckline with ruffled edges framing her stunning face.
 Her long blond hair flowed down to her shoulders.
 If I could put a caption over her head, it would have read, “If you talk to me, I will kill you.” She looked completely out of place, and her blue eyes lit up the room.
 Her silent stare suggested that she was not there to be picked up or even approached.
 She was not the typical girl entering an 80’s bar and dance club.
 My mouth must have dropped open as I watched her every move; she appeared to be looking for someone in particular.
 I looked at my friend Bill and I swear I said to him: “I am going to marry that girl!” We hadn’t been there long, and I wasn’t drunk or impaired in any way, I just remember she seemed to be literally glowing, and I knew.
 I had never felt this before and I have never felt it since.

Got us some studio time.
 He’d been to numerous practices, knew our stuff.
 And he agreed to produce, under the name Euphonious Moniker.
 Of course, now, everyone knows he did it, but back then, I don’t know, there were legal complications or something.
 Anyway, with Jim there, well, he gave us the confidence to do it.
 So we started laying down tracks.
 Now, the story that’s told is that I hated recording, that I was, I don’t know, juvenile, about doing numerous takes.
 I probably did say, “That was good enough,” a couple times.
 But, man, Jim is such a gentle man, he just took it all in stride.

 Most of those words he doesn’t use correctly.

The halls had emptied remarkably fast, especially considering how much gossip there was for the rumor mill.
 It was almost like some primitive survival instinct had kicked in and steered everyone away from ground zero.
 With the two of them so much closer, I could feel their energy beating at Jasmin and me.
 It was all I could do now to remain motionless as they entered what even I knew was striking range of Jasmin.
 "Awfully exposed out here, aren't you, precious?"
 Vincent's voice was a low, unnatural thing, pitched so it was just barely audible for humans.
 Cassie's expression made my stomach tighten up and my gorge rise.
 It wasn't right for a girl to look at another girl like that.
 Like she couldn't wait to watch Vincent do all kinds of terrible things.

I blinked and nodded.
 “Alright but if it starts getting crazy, wake me up.” “Wake you up?” he asked and laughed.
 “I'm sleeping too.
 If it gets crazy, they'll wake us up.” “Okay,” I said and yawned.
 I leaned my head against the tree and closed my eyes.
 The world seemed to fade around me, along with the bickering and Seth's hand, as I fell asleep.
 I opened my eyes to see that I was in a cave.
 I peered at the entrance of the cave to see that outside it was dark.
 I walked toward the entrance when something stopped me.
 “Don't go into the shadows, Jazell,” a familiar voice said.

 And I have the right to be pissed off.
 Jim – Johnny, do you still have mom’s note?

 The one that we were all the spawn of Satan and that she felt corrupted by being related to us.
 The one that she said…

 She shook her head with a youthful smile.

 I started to follow her, but Alec recaptured my hand in his.
 "She just needs a little time.

 My surprise must have bled through to my face.

First came word that troops were on their way to enforce an edict evicting all elves from the city.
 The more this rumor spread, the more elves seemed to arrive.
 Elven men and women with camouflage and great longbows patrolled the city.
 Even more lingered in taverns and the homes of kin.
 Many humans left for the homes of family and friends, wanting no part of the coming conflict, while others spent hours whispering with the elf men in the bars.
 The tension grew.
 A group of men, not daring to admit where their pay came from, built sturdy palisades between the two halves of town.
 Everyone knew why but none spoke of it, at least outside of a whisper.
 Two weeks after Harruq and Qurrah had slaughtered the messenger from Veldaren, the burning lights of an army encampment filled the fields north of Woodhaven.
 Soldiers of Neldar had arrived.

 His hand reached in.

“Follow me, please.” We followed without any words.
 We went outside and past some light pixies that were milling around the very small garden.
 One waved to me and I raised my hand in greeting.
 Crystalla walked into a small, dark building and I followed.
 It opened into a room with a high, glass ceiling.
 Ahead of us were four doors, each with a symbol I couldn’t see from here.
 Crystalla stopped and faced us.
 “Find the door with your symbol on it.” “Uh,” Jason raised his hand sheepishly, “how do we know which symbol is ours?” She smiled.
 “You will know.” She motioned for us to move up to the doors.
 I walked slowly and leaned forward to see the symbol.

I'd planned on remaining in my seat until everyone else left, but Mrs. Tiggs motioned me to her desk while half the class was still filing out the door.
 "It gives me no pleasure to tell you this, but based on your initial test score I think you should prepare yourself for the fact that you're probably going to fail this class.
 I worried this would be the result of your starting so late in the semester and not having any prior Spanish experience.
 Unfortunately, it's now too late for you to switch into another class.
 I'm afraid you'll just have to take the failing grade."
 I stood there woodenly for several seconds, unsure whether or not she was through.
 She finally made a shooing motion and turned back to grading papers.
 Predictably, there were still a half-dozen other kids in the classroom.
 They all turned back to the door and started filing out again, but by tomorrow half the school would know exactly how badly I'd just been humiliated.
 I found myself just outside the tutor lab with no recollection of having stumbled to my locker, or going by Physics to grab the stuff I'd left there.

He was a deeply religious man accompanied by his mousy wife and perfectly groomed daughter, all dressed in their Sunday best on their way home from church.
 He had believed all of Brandon’s lies, trusted my son and his roommates and ended up landlord of a drug den.
 He was devastated to see the condition of his property but he was strangely calm and understanding.
 He simply wanted our help to get Brandon’s belongings out of his house and fix things as best we could.
 He gave us an offer we couldn’t refuse.
 If we would get everything out by the evening and pull out all of the carpet, he would not pursue damages.
 None of us were prepared for what we saw when we turned the key in the lock and opened the door.
 Paper and cardboard blackened the windows.
 When we removed these window covers, we found broken panes behind them.
 The bedroom doors had been kicked in, and broken bongs and stem pipes, empty cigarette packs, matchbooks, just trash littered every surface.

It was probably not worth the cost of some of their excess equipment and limited gold, but the three of them all had good memories of the farm and liked the idea putting a roof back on the structure.
 The Nymphs with their connection with nature were the only humanoids unlikely to be attacked by the Dire Cats.
 The biggest surprise came when Jordaan came to say goodbye.
 Rodregas had his stuff all spread out in the room he had been using, organizing what would go where.
 The trunk had been left in the barn back at the farm, but its contents were now in his saddlebag.
 Rodregas had signaled Jordaan to wait a moment as he rolled his gear up.
 He was wrapping some of the Grimoires that they were not reading and the small mechanical toy frog that he had picked up in Ravenhurr’s laboratory when Jordaan made a funny sound and stepped forward.
 Jordaan seemed to be staring at the package and Rodregas wondered if he had recognized one of the Grimoires.
 Jordaan pointed at the newly wrapped package and said, “Excuse me, but can I see that?” Rodregas nodded and curiously handled the half wrapped pack over to the Nymph wondering what had captured his attention.
 The Nymph slowly laid the package on the bed and unwrapped it.

I managed to snap my slack jaw shut at the same moment I realized I had angled my body toward him when he’d addressed me.
 I mentally cursed, but I could recover this; I would just keep going in the same direction as if I were on my way to town, because I was on my way to town.
 There was no need for him to know it was to research someone associated with the Council.
 Someone like him.
 I tried to respond to his greeting, but felt choked and instead only nodded back, my mouth tight as I endeavored to grin with a now clenched jaw.
 I groaned internally, keeping on the path, not daring to look back in case he was behind me.
 I was convinced he was.
 He wouldn’t be taking the back way to Junnie’s as I had come, and he wouldn’t be leaving the village without a pack; he was likely going to a Council meeting.
 Yes, he was certainly right behind me, following me into town.
 Somehow I made it to the library without tripping or looking back, though I was nearly overcome with the temptation to turn at the door to see him one more time.

"Are you sleepy?"
 "A little."
 He put his arm around her, drawing her head onto his shoulder.
 "I guess it's a good thing we didn't go dancing."
 "Mmm."
 She snuggled up against him, smiling smugly.
 He squeezed her closer, burying his nose in her hair.
 "Your hair smells nice."
 "Thank you."
 He'd never held her pressed so close to him.

 She told him “those things were too good for someone as worthless as him.”  He must have cried for a month afterwards.
 That was just one event.

In deference to my new dedication to academic excellence, I finished up the reading, and then opened up my Biology book and started trying to get a handle on all of the items I'd thought I understood, but apparently hadn't.
 When the bell rang I limped back to my locker before making my painful way to Physics.
 I almost turned around and left when I saw the substitute again, but almost two decades of ingrained respect for authority figures propelled me into the room and to my seat.
 I happened to look up at the exact moment that Alec appeared in the doorway.
 I expected him to take one look at the sub and turn around like he'd done before, but he registered the presence of a substitute and then came inside regardless.
 It didn't make sense until the first girl all but fainted as he walked past her desk.
 Of course.
 He didn't like substitutes, and figured he had better places to be, but the draw of hero worship after having almost double-teamed Vincent was just too much to resist.
 The sub took a desultory roll, and then waved his hands at us.
 "Her notes say you're all supposed to be able to work on some kind of group project.

I wondered what Igneeria would be like.
 Maybe the place would be pretty decent… “Jazell?” Emily’s voice scattered my thoughts and I opened my eyes to see her walking briskly towards me.
 She too had an empty bag slung over her shoulder.
 She dropped her bag next to mine and leaned against the statue.
 Nobody spoke for awhile.
 Finally Emily opened her mouth and said, “What are you thinking about?” “What?” The question had caught me by complete surprise.
 “What are you thinking about?” she repeated.
 “Surely you must be thinking something; we’re going to some ‘other world’!” I closed my eyes.
 “I was just wondering what it would be like in Igneeria.
 What about you?” “Well,” she said thoughtfully, “I was thinking about Kojas-” “Emily don’t say his name, I don’t feel like being yelled at again.” I interrupted her.

He'd probably heard my pulse spike.
 Sometimes the fact that he was a shape shifter instead of just a normal boy was pretty inconvenient.
 Of course if he wasn't a shape shifter, then he wouldn't really be Alec.

 "You don't want to see your mom?"
 "It's not that, it's just that I know we're not going to be able to spend as much time together.
 It's not like she's going to let me sleep over."

 Out here the rain takes on other qualities.

She knelt beside him.
 "What is it?"
 After a few moments he turned to face her.
 "Do you know why those guys kept throwing the frisbee to you?"
 "To watch me jump and bend."
 When his eyes showed surprise, she told him, "I know I'm naive, Rick, but I'm not totally stupid.
 After all, you stared at me all morning."
 "That's different," he muttered, glancing away.
 "Why?"
 When he didn't answer, she took his hand, lacing her fingers with his.

It's probably easier to follow."
 As he read the article, he understood why she'd found it so difficult.
 Everything was presented in a way that made it seem like accomplished fact when in reality it was all theory.
 It was based on Einstein's theory of relativity.
 These wormholes Marie had mentioned were passages formed around black holes, which were collapsed stars.
 And it was all based on the assumption that something besides light could travel at the speed of light.
 In one small paragraph he found that the entire article was theory upon theory: no one had ever found a black hole or a wormhole or anything that could travel faster than the speed of light.
 "You didn't miss anything," Rick told Marie, setting the article aside.
 "Scientists think that it would be possible to travel through time by going through these wormholes the author mentions, but it's all theory.
 Nobody has ever discovered a wormhole, and none of this stuff has ever been proven."

 If she'd met him in 1927, she'd probably have felt every bit as much confusion as she was feeling now.
 He took her hand, pressing his lips into her palm.

Which reminds me, did you ever get the pictures from the Japanese tourists?
 Eugene – Actually yes.
 They’re in my photo album.
 They even wrote a letter.
 Jim – What does it say?
 Eugene – I’m not quite sure, they wrote it in Japanese.
 Johnny – We translated part of it though.
 Jim – So, what does it say?
 Johnny – Well I think it starts out “dear crazy American.”
 Eugene – And that’s about as far as we got.

Was it willing or was it not?”
 The spirit gave no answer.
 The half-orc stood, his hands clenched into fists.
 He hooked them through the air as he repeated his question.
 “Was it willing or not?” he demanded.
 “Yes,” Ahrqur whispered, grimacing as if filled with horrid pain.
 “When she approached me, I offered no resistance.
 Now will you let me return to peace?”
 “Not yet.
 Harruq, would you like to tell him?”

 "Aren't you tired?"
 "A little.
 I didn't get much sleep last night.
 But I'd rather talk."
 "All right."
 Arm in arm they returned to the living room and sat on the sofa.

Can I call you back in half an hour?"
 Mom stood there with the phone up against her ear for several seconds before shaking herself and looking at me.
 "That was some kind of promoter.
 She wants me to go out and shoot a fashion show in Paris.
 For a week and a half, and then another one in Italy.
 I've never heard of either of the shows, but she's offering me twenty thousand dollars for just three weeks."
 I felt my eyes go wide at the idea of something so unbelievable happening to us, and then even wider as I realized this must be what Alec had been referring to.
 'Convince her it's fine for her to leave' indeed.
 He hadn't been kidding about getting us out of the country.

She'd been way weirded out after my collapse.
 I wasn't sure even the promise of Brandon's continued presence would be enough to convince her to come through on her word.
 I hurried downstairs and grabbed my liquid lunch replacement out of the fridge.
 I was in such a hurry I almost didn't see the new note on the white board.
 Sorry I missed you last night.
 Found a really promising spot.
 Left early--looked like it might work if I was there at sunrise.
 --Mom I wasn't sure what to think.
 In theory she might be working on stuff for the brochure, but somehow I knew she was busy chasing her dreams once again.
 Good luck, I'll see you later.

They reached the western gate, which remained open during the day.
 Without ceremony, they were kicked through, both falling to the dirt and scraping their knees.
 “Get going,” one said.
 “See if somewhere else will take your mutt ass.”
 It was not just adrenaline that caused Harruq’s hands to shake, but Qurrah put his hand on his wrist and begged him to calm.
 “Never forget this shame,” he said.
 “Let it burn in you.
 Let it be a reminder of what I have always said.
 We are better, superior.
 Never feel guilt at what we do to them, for you see what they would do to us.”

How could she be so small and have such an incredible body?
 Marie glanced down at herself self-consciously.
 "You said that this was very modest."
 "It is."
 "Then why are you looking at me like that?"
 He swallowed.
 "I've never seen anyone who looks as good as you in one."
 She smiled then, reaching for his hand.

He picked up his car keys so that he could go find something nice.
 Marie was huddled in the middle of her bed sobbing.
 When her tears were at last exhausted, she dragged herself off her bed and went to wash her face with cold water and brush her teeth.
 Then she changed into shorts and a t-shirt.
 There was no point in pretending that she was in 1927.
 The clothes couldn't change what had happened.
 Even getting home tomorrow wouldn't change what had happened, what she’d finally realized tonight.
 She went downstairs and turned on the TV, wondering where Rick was.
 She felt bad for running away from him.
 She knew she must have hurt him, and the last thing in the world she wanted was to hurt Rick.

He reached a large stinking corpse lying on its back with a golden arrow in its forehead.
 Qurrah shoved the cadaver onto its side, curled underneath, and then let it fall atop him.
 The weight crushed his fragile body and the smell was awful, but it was his only cover.
 Miserable, he hid there, quietly whispering.
 “Where are you, Harruq?” he said, his face buried into the dirt.
 His tears fell to the grass.
 “Harruq, I need you.
 Where are you?”
 Then he heard talking and shut his mouth.
 “Are you alright, Dieredon?” an elf asked.

I didn't necessarily hate the mornings, but we weren't really on a first-name basis.
 More like acquaintances than friends.
 "You both used to be down in the kitchen eating breakfast at the crack of dawn almost every morning.
 Now it's like you don't even want to roll out of bed."
 She used to like mornings.
 I'd tagged along just because it hadn't seemed right to put a damper on such enthusiasm.
 Trust Mom to bring that up on my birthday.
 I swayed just a little.
 Today it didn't seem quite as bad, as long as I didn't think of her actual name.
 "Mom, I don't want to be late.

The tent is ripped from the ground and tumbles away leaving a clear view of the black helicopter that is lowering itself closer to the ground.
 The helicopter is about thirty feet above the ground, and now just behind the podium, over the limos.
 The side door slides open revealing two men in black suits.
 Everyone starts to dive for cover.
 I am seated next to Grandpa but I am now flat on the ground with the rest of the crowd attempting to duck the flying flowers, tripods, and debris, expecting a shower of bullets.
 Chairs are scattering as they tip over and who knows what those two men in the helicopter are going to do?
 I look up and the only man standing is Grandpa who has his arms in the air as the wind from the copter pounds him and ripples his suit like a flag in the wind.
 This deeply religious (and senile) old man proclaims loudly “the lord has come to take my son!” and he continues to repeat this line as if he is a TV preacher in a revival tent.
 I have an eye on the copter and a hand on Grandpa’s leg as I attempt to pull him to the ground with the rest of us.
 People are barely audible but they are screaming and crying and in total panic.

"Well, your homework is easier to grade than most.
 I also wanted to let you know that I'm happy with what you've been doing at the lab, and to give you this."
 As unbelievable as it was considering that most of my classmates seemed more concerned with working their fast-food jobs than with doing homework, the plain envelope she handed me contained my very first paycheck.
 Ever.
 I all but skipped out of the classroom.
 Later I'd probably complain about how small it was and wish I had enough to go shoe shopping, but for now it was just nice to know I had some discretionary money.
 Brandon looked up as I walked into the cafeteria, and waved me over.
 As I threaded between a pair of closely-set tables I noticed that Alec's table seemed unusually unsettled.
 If a shouting match could be conducted in whispers, it was being done by Jasmin and James, neither of who looked like they were happy about whatever was being discussed.
 Alec wasn't talking, but from the way he was scanning the room, he didn't want to be there anymore than the rest of them.

He’d prefer to face a dragon in unarmed combat.
 He’d have better odds surviving, too, based on Aurelia’s cold, steeled look.
 “You came all the way out here to thank me?
 Hardly sounds like an orcish thing to do.”
 One would not have thought gray skin could turn so red, but it did.
 “Well, I still want to repay you.” Harruq held out a small bag containing copper coins.
 “It’s all I have.
 Please, take it.”
 Aurelia glanced at the bag.
 “No,” she said.

I thought maybe he'd have moved on to something else by the time I was able to talk again, but he was still patiently waiting when I managed to make myself look up again.
 It was tempting to lie and tell him I was just thinking about Cindi, the only one in the family who'd ever really had any luck in the dating department, but that wasn't fair.
 Besides, it would only put off the dreaded day.
 Eventually he'd find out what I was really like.
 When the words finally made it out, they seemed to fight me the whole way, clawing at my throat with such force that by the time they finally exited my mouth, they were the barest hint of a whisper.
 "Because I'm worried once you realize just how much of a loser I was back home, how much of a loser I still am, you'll decide you don't belong with me."
 "Why would you not dating very much have any impact on how I feel about you?"
 "Because in addition to being the most thoughtful boy I've ever met, you also happen to be rich enough to buy a small country.
 You're so incredibly gorgeous girls swoon when you walk into a room.

"Now that has some real possibilities."
 I was still rolling the thought around in my mind when the bell rang and Alec pulled me to my feet.
 We swapped out our books and were halfway to Spanish when Vincent and Brandon strode into view.
 Moving so smoothly I was positive that nobody else even realized anything was wrong, Alec swung me around so he was between them and me.
 The tension ratcheted up in step with the rolling waves of energy, as Brandon and Vincent drew nearer.
 They split up when they saw us, casually positioning themselves so Alec couldn't protect me from both of them.
 I felt my knees stop working as I took in Brandon's lazy, confident smile, and Vincent's sick, eager expression, but the gentle pressure of Alec's grasp on my hand kept me from falling down.
 I looked up at Alec, hoping for a reassuring smile, but his face had taken on the expressionless mask he used to guard his thoughts.
 I tried to slow down, but Alec kept moving forward, never altering his speed in the slightest as he pulled me directly towards Vincent.
 It seemed incredible that the few other people still in the hall couldn't feel the surge of energy as Vincent stepped directly in front of us and placed his hand on Alec's chest.

Man, everything was happening.
 I started to lose myself when I played, you know, and it was kind of frightening, where I’d go when I played.
 I wasn’t even aware of Skippy and Crafty, except as background thunder, a wall I was bouncing off of.
 And, like sex, I was gone, man.
 At first I almost blacked out, it was so intense, but you learn to control it, right?
 I mean, I learned to let myself soar, to let myself fall into it, to not be afraid.
 You step up to the edge of the cliff and you think—you think—you can fly, but you’re really not sure.
 It’s that first jump that’s scary.
 After that, it’s all magic—after that I knew who I was.

When Buddy played lead guitar and sang for Black Lung, a blues rock band with a loyal Memphis following.
 The late Lee Baker, a guitar god himself then, said about Buddy, “He was the best of us.
 He was a seer, a prophet.
 That later acoustic stuff is crap, of course, but with Black Lung, Buddy was tapped into something other.” Back then, Black Lung played the Shell regularly, maybe opening for Johnny Winter, or teaming up with Mudboy and The Expanding Head Band for a mini-festival that would start at dusk and stumble into the early morning hours like a dreamer looking for paradise.
 Lot of medicine passed about in those days.
 Lot of prescriptions from the hoodoo man.
 It was the sixties, people, and in Memphis that meant The Strip, The Shell, The Bitter Lemon.
 Buddy was known all those places.
 Hell, Buddy was known everywhere in the River City.
 This is the story of Buddy’s taint, the story of Buddy and his pact with the devil.

The words of his brother echoed in his head.
 “Aurry?” he asked.
 “You said most elves remember when men were created…‌do you know how orcs were made?”
 The elf looked at him.
 She was trying to read him, Harruq could tell, but he endured it without protest.
 “When Ashhur and Karak warred, there were elves that sought to end it,” she said.
 “Against Celestia’s orders, they joined Karak, hoping their aid would finally end the conflict.
 When our goddess imprisoned the two gods, she cursed those elves.
 She stripped them of their beauty, their intelligence, and their long life.
 They weren’t evil, Harruq, but Karak offered them strength and they accepted it.

“Remember a few months back when I came home beaten, bloody, and blue?” he asked.
 “Guards caught me trying to sneak inside Maggie’s Tavern.
 They attacked me, said they were going to arrest me as the Forest Butcher.

 Qurrah rubbed his chin, lost in thought.
 He glanced at Harruq, a tiny smile forming on his face.
 “May I meet her?”
 Harruq immediately began blubbering.
 “No, but you see, I don’t know if she’s ready, and you might not…‌I need to let her know you’re coming first!”
 Qurrah chuckled.

They have servants for that.” The three shared a smile at that.
 Rodregas was very glad that he had insisted that she learn the fundamentals of blade work.
 “So what now?” he asked.
 “Now we go see if we can get some greater sigils,” said Doi’van.
 “We?” Rodregas asked.
 “And have you decided to take a greater sigil even it if cost you most of your magic?” Doi’van nodded and said, “Yes, I like to learn magic, but we are on a mission, one that is very important.
 The Immortalists, especially Taiga, must be stopped.
 If we are going to do that I will be of most use as a warrior.
 We have a powerful magic user,” he said with a smile.
 Imeralda smiled back at the complement and the three got back and continued their walk to the Chamber of Sigils.

We’ve been doing it right all along—except that you had to be the one thinking about my home.” "Yeah."
 Marie stared at him, her eyes widening in disbelief.

 "I'm sorry."
 She covered his face with kisses.

“You stayed home?
 Tell me you stayed home?” “Well, I stayed home all right, but that’s not the whole story.
 You see, the devil came for me.” “No.” Helga covered her face with both hands and peeked out.
 “Yes ma’am.
 He came right up and knocked on my door.” “But you didn’t let him in?” “Well, I wasn’t going to, but one look at that hunk of a man, and he got me in his spell.
 I hardly remember what happened.
 All I can tell you is, when I woke up in his arms this morning, I jumped out of his clutches and ran straight to here.
 You want to go home with me after the shift?
 If he’s still hanging around, maybe you can chase him off.” By now, Helga was wringing her hands.
 Her eyes had misted over.

Squeezing Rick's hand harder, Marie listened carefully as the flight attendant explained what to do in emergencies.
 When she'd finished, Marie pointed to an overhead panel and asked Rick, "Is this where the oxygen masks fall from?"
 "I think so."
 "Haven't you ever put one on?"
 "No.
 Traveling by plane is really safe, sweetheart.
 Far fewer people are killed in plane crashes than in car crashes."
 She sat back when she felt the airplane pick up speed.
 She was looking out the window, so she both saw and felt the plane leave the ground.
 "We're in the air!"

Addressing these challenges will require a substantial increase in financial resources devoted to education.
 In most regions, public expenditure on education has risen in recent years.
 In 1990, the world average was 13.5 per cent of total government expenditure, or 4.8 per cent of GNP.
 More than one-third of the countries in the world still spend more on the military than on education.
 Efforts to improve education must go hand in hand with efforts to promote peace and disarmament and drastically curtail military spending.
 Mechanisms should be put in place to insure that a significant portion of reduced military spending is invested in education and training.
 The very highest social priority should be given to six educational goals in both developing and developed countries.
 First, there must be a massive effort to achieve UNESCO’s goal of eradicating illiteracy worldwide by the year 2000.
 The problem can only be banished by an all-out commitment of every national government to eliminate the huge backlog of illiteracy, while at the same time insuring that every child is taught to read and write.
 National youth service corps and military personnel can be utilized to help provide the necessary manpower.

It doesn’t work.” I held my hands in front of me, helpless.
 Panic was taking me when she laid a hand on my shoulder and leaned forward.
 I expected her to calm me, explain it would come back, it would all be okay.
 Glitter was in the air before I could stop her.
 By the time Chevelle returned, I was loopy with it.
 He and Ruby sat facing me.
 She must have filled him in on my problem.
 I resisted the urge to touch him.
 I always wanted to touch him.
 “Frey,” Chevelle began in a measured tone.

He loved her far too much to put her through that.
 But they couldn't go on like this.
 He'd always prided himself on his self-control, but living under the same roof with a woman he loved, a woman who begged for his kisses--that was too much.
 But he knew Marie didn't really understand.
 She thought that they could just kiss forever.
 If only he could convince her to stay here with him.
 He was sure that she'd eventually come to accept the fact that she wasn't going to be able to get back home, but he was afraid they'd end up making love before she'd reached that point.
 And while making love on their wedding night would be a wonderful, earth-shattering experience for them both, he knew that making love before marriage would probably have disastrous results for her--and therefore for him.
 So he had to convince her to stay.
 And to marry him.

 "If you like."
 He smiled at Jefferson.
 "Your father and I were going to discuss business this morning, but--" "But I think it's much more important for Davis to take you shopping.
 Go ahead, young man--we can put business off for a few hours."
 Marie hung onto Davis' arm as they walked out to his automobile.
 "Thank you for taking me.
 I haven't seen you since Tuesday!"
 "And you've missed me?"
 "Terribly."

They had control over me.
 My thoughts shifted, running through it again, going backwards from where I was.
 Their faces, the chanting from behind me, Chevelle backing away, the dream.
 The water.
 I remembered being trapped underwater just before waking, but I hadn’t been drowning.
 It wasn’t a dream.
 I was horrified as more of the memory returned.
 The cloaks who had surrounded my mother, killed her, had been circling me.
 I knew they’d intended to destroy me, too, though I couldn’t see why.
 Chevelle had held me, pulled me into the water.

This model should become so precise that we can anticipate the impact of peace, more education, greater political freedom, rising social expectations, and high values such as guaranteed employment on the progress of society.
 This conceptual knowledge should enable us to understand and replicate fully the conditions responsible for the post-war achievements of Japan, China’s recent 20 per cent growth rate or Yugoslavia’s remarkable conquest of hyper inflation.
 A comprehensive approach will enable us to anticipate the imbalances and side-effects generated by partial initiatives and to evolve total strategies to avoid them.
 The comprehensive conceptual model needs to be complemented by the development of models for employment, food, education, trade and other fields that go beyond the national or sectoral approach to show the impact of the complex interactions that are key determinants of the development process – for instance, the impact of democracy on agriculture and of increasing agricultural productivity on employment, industrialization and trade, the impact of rising education on democratization, social tolerance for diversity, personal expectations and social stability.
 Once formulated, these conceptual models need to be applied under a variety of conditions to test their validity and demonstrate the value of a comprehensive approach to development.
 Therefore, we have proposed that the UN adopt a number of districts in different regions of the world, including crime-ridden inner cities or impoverished rural areas in industrial countries, to evolve and apply strategies for their rapid transition to a higher level of development.
 Six Goals in Education
 Once formulated, this knowledge needs to be imparted through education.
 Education is the greatest known civilizing force and the single most powerful lever for human development.
 Training imparts skills, but education increases the capacity of the individual at a more basic level, making the mind more active and alert, converting physical energy into mental energy, training us to see things from a wider perspective, to question and challenge the status quo, to think and imagine, to innovate and invent, to make decisions for ourselves and to act on our own initiative.

What had I gotten myself into?
 I didn’t want brains splattered all over my truck, especially if they were mine!
 I was then shown pictures so I could verify Ashley and recognize Steve.
 It was her, and his head was practically shaved bald.
 He looked like your typical punk kid, just like Brandon.
 “Is his hair still that short?” I asked.
 “Not the last I saw.
 Why?” “Well, if his hair is longer, I can at least grab him by the head if he pulls a gun on me.” At this point I was given a lecture and the shots fired instructions again, because apparently I hadn’t gotten the message the first time.
 I was to stay in my truck and tell them to get in when they arrived.
 I was also told that the dealers would try to move me to another location and I was to stand my ground and never agree to move, even if it was just across the street.

Make it stop, make it stop… Seth gave me a comforting squeeze but it didn’t help.
 I tried to think of something else, like penguins or llamas.
 Anything, I didn’t care what I thought about, it could be underwear, as long as I wasn’t thinking about what was actually happening to me right now.
 Llamas, I thought urgently.
 Llamas are furry and they spit at you when they’re mad.
 They’re the joke of most middle school kids, they’re tall…I think.
 You can see them at parks or zoos.
 They tend to try to steal your dad’s hat at the zoo.
 They can be black, brown, and white.
 I don’t think there are pink or purple or green llamas out there unless you dye them.

I even finished my assignment a good ten minutes before class was scheduled to end.
 I was absently sketching what I expected the inside of the opera house to look like, when a tap on my shoulder pulled me out of my reverie.
 "I'm so sorry, Mrs. Campbell.
 I finished early, but I should have started on one of the catch-up assignments.
 I just didn't want to get into a whole new subject with only ten minutes left."
 Her smile was much more understanding than normal for a classroom situation.
 It took the sting out of the words that were probably just for the people close enough to overhear.
 "Don't you worry, Miss Paige, I'll let you know when I don't think you're keeping up.
 Seeing as you are done though, would you please run something over to Mrs. North?
 I'd do it, but I need to go to a special projects meeting today during lunch."

It was called Turntable Poison.
 Some say it sounded like The Rascals crossed with Hot Tuna.
 One cut comes to mind, a piece they played in every set at The Shell, the ballad, “Mr.
 Handy and Hakel-Bärend.”  On the LP they insisted on the extended version with Buddy’s long, side-handed solos, slick as molten lead and the twelve minute drum solo by Skippy Quetzalcoatl, effectively killing the album’s potential sales but insuring the group a spot in infamy alongside the lost tapes of Mudboy and the Neutrons and the missing five hours of von Stroheim’s Greed.
 There was also the shorter, “Blues for Wendy Ward,” with its plaintive chorus, “Thank you for at least that sweet ache,” a phrase Buddy made sound like a supplication to the gods.
 “Wendy Ward” got some air play around the country, on the late night FM stations, a minor flickering fame which only whet Buddy’s appetite for more, for larger radio audiences, larger followings, more groupies, better food backstage.
 He wanted it all, Buddy did.
 No one asked him, What is all?
 If they had he might be here today.
 Who can say?

Already longer than The Crying of Lot 49.
 So, when this comes out, I’ll be vindicated, right, I’ll be made sense of.
 More than any man deserves, I guess.
 But, hell, why else are we doing this?
 It’s gotta be a story or people aren’t gonna read it, aren’t gonna care.
 It’s gotta have an arc and that arc has to end with some kind of positive energy, some chi.
 You know how to do this, right?

I sat motionless as I watched him go, and remained so for some time after.
 I hadn’t realized how exhausted I’d been.
 When I finally rose to leave, I stashed a few more of the northern clan documents from the table under my shirt.
 My head was swirling with all that had happened, not simply my new tutor but the magic.
 On my way out I walked past the shelf that hid the body of the now-dead bird.
 I’d never been able to move objects, but it seemed I had done it without thinking.
 And it wasn’t just that, but the thistle.
 I needed to see Junnie.
 The door was partially open when I reached Junnie’s house, so I peeked my head in and called for her.
 When she didn’t answer, I slipped in to check the back room.

Today, vast sections in developing countries are stirred to action because their expectations are not fulfilled.
 Economic liberalization has unleashed people’s expectations: witness the rush of Chinese peasants to invest in the stock market and the increasing demand of Indian villagers for a range of consumer goods.
 The same movement continues in the West as increased physical and social mobility, the growing demand for higher education and the widespread urge for greater recreation and travel.
 These expectations are the seed and driving force for social progress.
 They provide the energy and create the openness and willingness for change.
 But they also increase the danger of frustration, disappointment and violence.
 The end of the Cold War was expected to usher in an age of peace, but actually violence is on the rise in both developing and developed countries because of the widening gap between human expectations and achievements.
 This growing gap between expectations and achievements is at the root of contemporary turbulence worldwide.
 The popular and some times violent demand for freedom and participatory democracy, the return of religion in politics, surging ethno-nationalism and intolerance, and rising urban crime are disparate expressions of this phenomenon.
 In Eastern Europe, where a peaceful revolution from within has broken the shackles of statism that long confined the energies of people, these energies now surge forward in high and eager expectations of a better life.

I was back in the circle, the group of us sitting around a small fire.
 Ruby was telling stories.
 She related the tale of Bonnie Bell, a blue fairy from the East.
 “He hunts the human children, luring them in with glitter and lights, and eats them, beginning with their tiny little toes.
 Though he gives no choice in the matter, in exchange, he allows the mother one wish.” I scoffed, “Humans aren’t real.” “Even so,” she continued, smiling wickedly, “you’d be surprised how many don’t think to wish for their children back.” Raucous laughter floated up around the ring.
 Fairy tales indeed.
 It felt good being there, surrounded by my new companions, a fire and stories, laughter.
 This was more of a home than Fannie’s had ever been.
 But I was also under the influence of a fairy.

Chevelle gave her a doubtful look and then glanced at me, apparently deciding I deserved it.
 He nodded once and walked toward the rock ledge.
 Ruby bounced from foot to foot, celebrating her victory.
 As Chevelle moved past Anvil and Grey, they turned to follow him.
 The silver-haired elves and their dogs were nowhere in sight.
 My gaze caught Steed, who was watching me.
 I always forgot how strikingly handsome he was until I looked right at him.
 He wore a thin, loose shirt now, rolled at the sleeves and covered by a leather vest.
 It matched the long cuffs on his forearms, the same dark, worn leather of his saddles.
 He stepped closer, taking my chin in his hand to examine my face in the moonlight.

Brandon shook his head.
 "I won't let her.
 That's part of why I wanted to talk to you.
 I won't let anyone do anything to you.
 Think of it as repayment."
 The words weren't anything special, but there was something about the way he said them that made me absolutely sure he'd deliver on his promise, that he was somehow completely in control of his surroundings.
 The intensity in his stare was too much, and I found myself looking away, trying to buy some time to collect myself.
 Luckily I wasn't so far gone as to not recognize where we were.
 "Oh, gosh, that was the turnoff to my house.
 I'm so sorry."

 He offered his employer a slight smile.

The ground had spots of grass sticking out of sand and rock.
 Luckily, there was no wind down here to toss up the sand and dirt.
 I think I passed the spot where the Kojas had stood in my dream.
 I threw the thoughts out of my head and tried to think of something else.
 Like, where this flat plain of flatness ended.
 “Where are we going, anyway?” I asked and stared at the sky.
 It was going to get dark soon.

 The man in black robes lifted his hand.
 Qurrah saw pale and bony fingers hooked in strange formations.
 Then came the fire, erupting as if those fingers were a crack releasing the melted rock of the abyss.
 The sudden light blinded them both.
 The fire burned through the orcs as a solid beam, melting their bodies and scattering their remains.
 When it struck the wooden gate, it exploded.
 Wood shattered.
 Guards behind the gate howled as molten rock struck them, piercing through their shields and armor.
 The orcs roared at the sight, not at all upset at their own losses.

Chapter 18 I felt my stomach do handsprings as I walked inside the opera house.
 The week had flown by much faster than expected.
 Especially considering how slowly each individual day had dragged along.
 Most of my waking hours had been spent wondering if Saturday night was ever going to arrive.
 My train of thought shattered as I got my first glimpse of the interior of what'd become my own personal Mecca.
 The exterior of the building had been impressive, complete with statues and sculptures reminiscent of an eighteenth-century opera house, but I hadn't expected the illusion to hold once I passed through the enormous, gilded doors.
 I'd been wrong.
 The floors were a gorgeous marble which drew the eyes to the nearest golden-white wall, and up the elaborate gilded trim towards vaulted ceilings.
 It was like walking into a palace, complete with painted, spun-sugar clouds, and burgundy drapes made out of rich velvet.
 If it wasn't for the press of people pushing me from behind, I probably would've stayed in the front entryway right up until the sound of the orchestra filtered down to me.

I flew off the cliff, falling straight down.
 I stared back at him as he stood, watching me fall, nothing but open sky above and below.
 I couldn’t imagine why he’d throw me from the cliff, couldn’t think of the magic to stop myself, couldn’t see when I would crash into the base, the rocks below.
 My arms flailed as I jerked awake.
 The group stared at me.
 “Frey?” Ruby asked.
 I grappled for breath.
 “Just a dream.” A few chuckles moved through the crowd.
 Ruby was more interested.
 “What about?” I glanced at Chevelle, a few paces away.

 Guard captain Antonil marched through the street, leading fifty of his men marching in perfect union.
 His face was a portrait of stoic calm, but it was all a lie.
 His heart was troubled and he had not a soul to tell why.
 He held a proclamation of King Vaelor to the entire nation of Neldar.
 He had argued as best he could, but his words meant little.
 When Antonil asked that someone else deliver the proclamation, a frown had crossed the king’s smooth face and he had slammed his lotioned hand against a table.

“Nothing?” Qurrah asked when Harruq stepped inside.
 “Nothing.”
 It seemed Qurrah would leave it at that, but he clearly saw the apprehension on his brother’s face.
 “Tell me the truth,” he said.

 Harruq sighed, and he removed his swords and flung them to the ground.
 “I can’t do it,” he said.
 “We don’t need it.
 _You_ don’t need it.

There were so many holes rusted through the bottom we could see the garage floor through the trunk.
 We removed every wire, rubber seal, window felt, and had boxes full of zip-lock baggies that were marked with a Sharpie what the part was and where it had come from.
 When Brandon was about fifteen, we went to Hot August Nights in Reno, a huge hot rod auto show.
 We wandered through these aisles of incredible cherry vehicles and talked about how someday ours could be alongside these beauties.
 This project would prove to be a huge challenge that would last seven-plus years, partly because it coincided with the start of Brandon’s drug use.
 What started as a project he was very enthusiastic about became an afterthought to time with friends and partying.
 He would show up for certain monumental events like when we put the body back on the frame after it was painted, but I was pretty much on my own with it for a bit.
 My wife was a champ as “that thing” (her nick-name for it) sat in a million pieces in the garage for so long.
 Seeing Brandon heading down the wrong path, I knew only what not to do.
 I had no idea what to do.

Her mouth was twisted in a smile, loaded with false honey.
 I noticed her eyes then, looking past the heavy paint they wore, to dark green jewels… emeralds.
 They were so like those I had just examined in the mirror that I had to look away.
 “Frey,” I replied softly.
 “Thank you for the room.” She seemed disappointed I had no further comment.
 She flitted her hand in dismissal as she swirled out of the room and back to Chevelle, the metal bracelets around her wrists tinkling like chimes.
 “I’m off to town then.
 You know, a handsome hunk of horsemeat was asking about you this morning.” My ears perked up.
 Someone was asking about Chevelle?
 That must have been why we were here.

I heard Ruby behind me now.
 In a low voice she said, “They have heard of your return.
 They have come to see for themselves.” Their rulers had burned, along with so many of their families.
 After the massacre, there had been no one.
 From the dead, it seemed, I had returned.
 Chevelle stepped to my right side, placing something cold and heavy in my hand.
 My sword.
 I knew what to do then.
 I took a deep, steadying breath as I raised the blade to the air.
 There was a faint pause, the briefest tick before the bird took flight, its wings hitting wind as the shift began, and then nothing could be heard but my name, roared in the song of the crowd below.

His worn traveling clothes were gone, exchanged for dark gray and black, a leather vest covering his shirt, the laces loose at his chest.
 A long, dark cloak was clasped at his shoulders, the material thick and coarse, so unlike the soft robes the rest of council wore.
 I knew I was gaping at him, but there was something so strange about it.
 He caught my eye and I let my gaze fall to his sword belt, struggling to gather my composure.
 I had to remind myself that he despised me.
 By late afternoon, our path opened to look down on the village nestled in the rocks of a narrow valley ahead.
 Chevelle stopped on a ridge to allow us a better view.
 I didn’t think I would have called it a village—I couldn’t count the structures from our vantage point but it must have been ten times the size of home.
 The buildings were the dull stone of the mountain.
 None were trees.

“Wanted to thank you for sparring with me,” he said.
 “They’re beautiful,” Aurelia said as she inhaled the aroma.
 “But why the box?”
 Harruq turned a new shade of red.
 “Well, I’d look weird walking down the street with those flowers in hand.
 I do have a reputation to keep.”
 The elf laughed.
 “Thank you, Harruq.
 Are you ready to begin?”
 He nodded, eager to have the awkwardness pass.

No more than a second or two of breathlessness could have possibly passed, but Alec pulled away, firmly holding me at arm's length.
 "You need to get some sleep.
 Regardless of how the fight turns out, you'll need to be well-rested."
 My best longing look didn't seem to be having any effect on him, so I finally nodded and relaxed back onto the bed.
 "I guess I did promise to behave myself.
 I don't think I'll be able to sleep, but if you'll tell me another story I'll at least try..." Apparently satisfied by my promise, Alec joined me on the bed and pulled me close.
 I was still chilled enough from being outside for the warmth of his arms to feel good.
 "Adjam and Inock found that the dayborn had lost all knowledge of their loving mother, and that they reacted poorly to Inock's plague form.
 Neither brother was able to maintain their original forms for more than a few hours at a time, and although Adjam was able to blend in with the animals found in the area, there was nothing like Inock's feline body nearby, and he was chased and hunted by many of the dayborn, for they thought him a demon."
 Alec's breath caressed the back of my neck even as his quiet, velvety baritone reached inside my head and smoothed away the tensions that'd been keeping me from seeking sleep.

A woman was coming out of one house, wearing very short blue trousers, and Marie ran in the other direction.
 She had to find Rick's house!
 Being stuck in the future was bad enough, but if she couldn't find Rick again, she'd-- "Marie!"
 She turned toward his voice.
 "Rick?"
 "Where are you?"
 "Here!
 I'm lost!"
 But then she saw him and ran to him, throwing her arms around him.
 "I couldn't get back home!"

We felt as though we were getting our son back!
 We made the long drive to attend the graduation ceremony with our younger son, Bryce, my mother, my in-laws—who were no longer in the dark— and my brothers.
 It was a gathering including all the students and the staff.
 Prior to the ceremony we were invited to eat dinner with everyone.
 We walked the food line with all who attended, a variety of foods were spooned into our plates and I felt like I was it was chow time in the mess hall.
 We were seated close to the front in a crowded cafeteria room.
 The room was a scattering of mismatched tables and chairs and old couches that were obviously a collection of donations.
 It started with accolades and awards for those early in their treatment and worked its way through the students by their personal achievements inching towards the finale of the three students set to “graduate” tonight.
 Everyone who was recognized for reaching a new level of their treatment was welcome to speak if they wished.
 Those who were in the program longer were more likely to do so, thanking others (both students and staff) for helping them through their most difficult challenges.

It didn’t take long before I’d found their new camp.
 I slipped into a tall tree to watch them.
 To my shock, I found something I had never seen before.
 I watched for hours before I was sure, too stunned to believe it possible.
 I had heard stories, the fairies were always puffing dust about it, but I’d never believed it.
 Was I really watching humans?
 I was pulled from reading, confused.
 Humans weren’t real.
 What kind of book was this?
 She had mentioned fairies’ stories.

Korin was a good looking man.
 It was always weird with him.
 He changed bodies so often that you always felt like you were meeting someone new, but it was not long before you realized that it was Korin.
 He wore a slim male body that was well-built, not much over 20 years old, with blue eyes and blond hair.
 Rodregas was not sure what to say to him so he stood there simply looking.
 He was the Master and it would not be surprising for Ravenhurr to keep him waiting for a few minutes.
 Korin waited patiently, seemingly at ease with what Rodregas would assume to be strange behavior by Master Ravenhurr.
 “Are you ready to leave and celebrate my new birth?”  Rodregas asked him.
 Adept Korin nodded politely and said, “Yes, Master, the gods favor your desire to imitate their celestial glory.” Rodregas nodded back in acknowledgement and said, “And have you found any new bodies who you would like to… take?” That question seemed to surprise him, but Korin smiled and said, “No, Master.
 I have been too busy working on my studies.” Korin now looked at him with a surprised expression and an eyebrow slightly raised.

He kept walking as he looked my direction, surveying the damage from the fire.
 I was convinced he would know it had been me, but he didn’t stop or even slow.
 It made no sense.
 Why hadn’t he investigated further?
 Was he not here looking for me?
 He was my watcher and I was missing.
 So where else would he be going?
 Before I had, regrettably, torched the documents, I had seen Junnie noted as his contact.
 My pulse sped at the idea that he might be going to her, to get her help in finding me.
 If he was my watcher, I’d be his responsibility, and she was the only one who knew me at all aside from Fannie.

“Canadian Sunset,” “Old Brown Jug,” “St.
 Louis Blues,” “Blues for Allen Felix.”  It was a revelation.
 But, never to be repeated.
 I think I was about 6 at the time, but that hour in front of Dick Delisi and the Syncopators is as fresh in my mind as if it happened yesterday.
 Man, my dad.
 What could he have been?
 Given different times, a different circumstance.
 He said something odd to me one time, he said: “Bud, music is a bad demon to have.
 Like hooch.
 If I could have done anything else I would have.”  And, of course, he did, I mean playing at the Vapors wasn’t bringing in enough money to support his small family, so he did books for a paint store.

she exclaimed--had Miss America representatives in a contest that was televised every year, along with a Miss Universe contest, and that evolution was taught in most schools now, alongside creation in some parts of the country.
 She told him that she'd always wanted to see Josephine Baker's stage show and Louis Armstrong and his trumpet, and he told her that anyone truly talented and/or popular now eventually did a television special.
 She told him about the excitement over the discovery of King Tut's tomb in 1922, and as she was explaining how it had inspired the Egyptian motif of her dress, she glanced around and realized how out of style she was.
 "Dresses are sometimes quite short," she observed, "but not all of them.
 And I never would have believed that women would wear trousers in public without causing a stir!"
 "You should see the bathing suits."
 "They're shorter than the dresses?"
 He laughed.
 "`Short' isn't the word.
 There are no legs, no arms, sometimes no middle, and they're cut very low."

His heart stopped for a moment.
 Rodregas thought she was going to take his hand for a second.
 With his free hand he made a fist and slammed the side of her head.
 Not with all his strength, but still a serious hit.
 She grunted and let go, growled and stepped over the bear’s body.
 He slowly reached up, and using the full strength of his body, pushed hard on her muscular chest, pushing her away from the bear’s haunch.
 He then ignored her and went back to cutting the haunch loose.
 He waited but the two lionesses seemed to have gone from aggression to napping, with him missing the transition.
 Slowly, Rodregas got up with his bear haunch and took it back to the barn.
 He met the surprised look of Doi’van and Imeralda with a half smile, “I hope you like the taste of bear?” As he was unsure of how old the meat was, he immediately started a fire and started to cook it.

Then she smacked Seth across the head with it.
 “Live with it Seth.” Emily said every word apart and wacked him again.
 Seth made a small, “Ow.” Every time she hit him.
 He grimaced and said, “Stop hitting me already!” “Alright,” She made a motion to put the stick down and hit him again in the head.
 He glared at her and she threw it on the floor, “Now I’m done.” “So Jason,” I faced him and he looked up at me, “since Seth won’t tell me I’ll ask you.
 How did you guys find us?” “We followed a dwarf that was running here.
 If we didn’t get lost, we would have been here faster,” Jason’s face turned the color of his red Igneerian hair.
 “It’s okay, at least you answered me,” I shot Seth a look.
 “Well if it’s okay with you boys, we would like to get to bed.
 It’s almost 1:30 in the morning, and I would like to get home before my dad wakes himself up,” Emily said, and walked towards her house.

 Curious.
 "What do you mean we can't go hiking?"
 She was looking around at the other students.
 "Nothing, come on.

"They can't do that, can they?

 Mom rooted around in a half empty box until she found some tissues, it wasn't the first one she'd been through this afternoon.
 "I didn't think so, but Mr. Peters claims there was never any contract signed and I can't find our copy in any of the boxes."
 "Mom, what are we going to do?
 Where will we go if they kick us out?"
 She smoothed my hair back from my face.
 "Don't worry about that, sweetie.
 I'm sure everything will be okay.
 I was just over-reacting.

 That pleasure was only one of many that day.
 First she loaded the dishwasher while Rick supervised, and she poured in the soap and started the machine herself.
 After a shower, she had lessons on the use of the food processor, the blender, and--delight of delights--the microwave oven.
 "I can make lunch now," she proclaimed happily.
 "Do you like to cook?"
 "Yes."
 But her face fell.
 "To be honest, I don't know how.

“His mother died, too.
 We killed her.” It sounded so matter-of-fact, my head bobbing along with the words.
 I couldn’t seem to stop.
 My mouth opened to speak once more but I was suddenly swept up, off Steed’s lap and into Chevelle’s arms.
 I managed fear for half a second but then lost the feeling to dizziness, followed quickly by only dull numbness.
 Chevelle was laying me on my bed.
 “Stay here.
 It will pass.” His words were gentle now, the anger gone.
 “I’m sorry,” I whispered.
 He didn’t respond.

Breaking off the kiss, she stood and turned away from him as tears poured down her cheeks.
 "What's wrong, sweetheart?"
 Rick stood, putting his hands on her shoulders.
 Marie shrugged his hands off.

 "If I'm in love with you, how will I bear it when I go home?"
 He stared at her.

 "Yes.

“Today,” he yelled out, “we have a match of men and women who are ready to become knights, to be the very Champions of the Gods on this world.
 They are all worthy, but there can be only one new knight this day.” Faurrenida looked around slowly catching each of them by the eye.
 Rodregas was caught up in the commanding presence of the man.
 “To the Order and to the Celestials!” his voice was half command and half prayer.
 Everyone including combatants and those watching from wall and window responded, so that the words swirled around the arena.
 “To the Order and to the Celestials!” This time the Grand Marshal seemed to look around at all the spectators until finally he nodded, satisfied.
 Without another word he strode out.
 Imeralda followed him as did all the squire’s attendants.
 It was time for the final match.
 Rodregas left his shield and mace relaxed at his side and strode over to Nordien, who stood with shield and mace at the ready.

“I need a drink,” he said, turning toward the town and trudging back.
 All he could think about was getting a good, stiff drink.
 If he was lucky, he might get in a good bar fight.
 Nothing helped him forget his worries better than walloping a fellow drunken idiot.

You finished eighth overall in the tournament, with a second place white ribbon for the joust.
 Several of those who would now be higher are too injured to continue.
 So you are now in fourth place overall.
 Geriodon and Nordien were the top two finishers,” said Doi’van.
 Rodregas nodded.
 The pain was easier to manage knowing that at least he was still in the running for the tournament championship.
 Imeralda stepped into his sight shaking her head, “You men are crazy sometimes; you actually look pleased!
 If your armor had not held you would be dead now.
 And it is not like you are fighting someone who deserves to die.
 Most of these men are honorable warriors.” Rodregas nodded.

Curling up on the bed, she stroked one sleeve.
 She wondered what Rick was doing right now.
 Had he gone to work?
 She suspected that he'd been too upset to work.
 He'd probably sat in the garden until he'd known for sure she was gone.
 He might even still be there, hoping she hadn't gone back, that she was lost somewhere in 2011 and would eventually call out to him to come find her.
 Tears began to run down her cheeks.
 She fell asleep and dreamed that she, her parents, her brother, and Rick were at Cape Cod.
 When she awoke a couple of hours later, she felt feverish.
 Frowning, she felt her forehead.

Brandon's smile was back, but it didn't have his trademark easy carelessness.
 "Now you sound like my mom."
 We rounded a corner before Brandon could say anything else and nearly ran into Britney.
 "Guys!
 Did you see the back door?"
 I could almost see the wheels turning in Britney's head.
 First she went red as she remembered she'd stranded me at school, then her eyes got a little wider as she realized it was still about five minutes too early for me to have arrived on the bus.
 Brandon's normal smile was back.
 "Yeah, Adriana noticed it almost as soon as we pulled up to the school."
 Her suspicions that Brandon had given me a ride into school satisfied, Britney managed a sickly smile and mumbled something about seeing us later as she disappeared around the corner.

“Didn’t need them.”
 Harruq went to the other side of the house and started punching holes in the walls.
 Qurrah might have inquired further but he was lost in his own secret.
 The night didn’t come soon enough for either of the two brothers.

But although in reality both systems are dead, the ideology of the capitalist system lives on and casts an illusory impression of supremacy.
 Rather than searching for a victor and vanquished, the urgent need is to find a successor that combines and synthesizes the enlightened values of both systems – freedom and equality, liberty and security.
 It has been amply proved that the authoritarian state is incapable of exerting a benevolent authority over the people without imposing severe restrictions on freedom, stifling human energy and creativity, leading sooner or later to rising discontent and a loss of social vitality.
 It is also abundantly clear that money as an institution operating through the free pricing mechanism of the market system – although it does succeed in generating high levels of energy, creativity and productivity – regards people as a purchasable commodity or a potential market, but is otherwise indifferent to human values and welfare.
 Neither the determinism of the state nor the determinism of the market can be adequate in themselves to achieve the goals of peace and prosperity that we strive after.
 It has been generally assumed that the transition now taking place in Eastern Europe will sooner or later lead these countries to adopt forms of government and economy identical to those prevalent in the West.
 But for those raised in a society that offered a great measure of social security, the poverty and insecurity of the Western system are gross inadequacies.
 While it is clear that these new democracies have rejected the authoritarian statist system, it is not yet clear what finally they will accept, discover or invent as a more acceptable alternative.
 The creativity and inventiveness they have exhibited in seeking an alternative in the past may quite possibly lead them to discover that better social system which both East and West are in need of.
 Viewed from an evolutionary perspective, we may surmise the general direction and likely destination of that quest.

Have a problem with that?” “All right then,” he said and leaned against the wall.
 “Sweet dreams to you two.” “Yup sweet dreams to us,” I said and closed my eyes.
 “Goodnight Emily.” “Goodnight Jazell.” I drifted off, feeling surprising comfy against Seth's shoulder and hearing Jason softy snore.
 I opened my eyes to see myself standing in the woods.
 The sky saw clearer and it wasn't raining anymore.
 It was eerie quiet and as I stood there it felt like I had never left the woods.
 I heard a voice whispering one word over and over again.
 “Jazell...” “What?” I called.
 “What do you want?” “Jazell...” the voice whispered again.
 “Jazell.” “What?” I screamed into the trees.

The sound of the door and his voice had them looking at me from around his large frame.
 Their conversations stopped as their attention was drawn to the commotion.
 I stood and Dino directed me to approach him.
 He was obviously drunk and I could see the usual crazed look in his eyes.
 He started rambling something about how I didn’t like him or respect him and I quickly claimed I did.
 I was a lanky fifteen year old, probably about 5’8’, 140 pounds.
 He stepped towards me as I obeyed his wish for me to come to him.
 He hit me so fast I didn’t see it coming, and I flew backwards onto the desktop.
 All four legs of the desk broke beneath the impact of my body.
 I lay there stunned on my back.

“Harruq, I want you to make me a promise.”
 “And what is that?”
 Aurelia leaned back and tucked a few strands of hair behind her ear as high above the stars sparkled sadly.
 “Promise you will never strike at me, or those close to me, ever again.”
 The half-orc shifted uncomfortably in the grass.
 “You know I’d never do that.”
 “No, Harruq, I don’t know.
 I think I know, I desperately want to believe I know, but I don’t.
 So promise me.”
 “Aurry…”

“Why do we fight?” she asked again, desperately trying to block every swing.
 Blood covered her arms, and another swing cut through her dress, slicing into the beautiful flesh of her leg.
 “Why, Harruq?
 Why!”
 “I don’t know!” he cried.
 Strength surged into him, dark and unholy.
 In the blink of an eye, he twirled both swords, knocked Aurelia’s staff from her hand, and then looped his right arm all the way around to bury Condemnation deep into her stomach.
 Everything, all fighting, all arguing, all bleeding, living and dying halted at that moment.
 For Harruq, there was only the sight of Aurelia doubled over, her eyes filled with sadness.
 His arm yanked the blade out of her, without any thought on his part.

She sighed, letting herself be comforted by his embrace.
 August was just around the corner now, and she and her mother normally spent August at Cape Cod.
 Her father joined them on weekends.
 They wouldn't go there this year—not with her still missing.
 She'd been gone five weeks now.
 Five weeks and two days.
 And they had no idea what had happened to her.
 "I love you, sweetheart."
 She smiled, his words bringing her out of her reverie.
 Yesterday he'd told her he loved her more times than he had the previous four or five days combined.

It wasn't until I'd finished dry-heaving and was trying to clean myself back up, that I wondered where they'd been.
 The school building wasn't that big.
 If they'd really been trying to break up the fight, they should have arrived minutes earlier.
 I thought about hiding in the bathroom for a while, but that was exactly the kind of place a girl like Cassie would want to catch me.
 Instead I took a deep breath and walked outside.
 Britney was waiting for me.
 By her expression she'd decided on being mad.
 "Do you realize what you just did?"
 I was still fresh out of witty comments.
 I just shrugged instead.

“Epic.” “Epic?” Seth scoffed.
 “That’s all you can say?
 This,” he motioned to the dark archway, “can't be described by one word.” I smiled to myself.
 The old Seth seemed to be coming back, which was great.
 I was getting really tired of quiet, watching Seth.
 “Then how about ‘the coolest thing on Earth?’” Jason asked.
 Seth shook his head.
 “No, it’s not even a part of Earth.
 Try creepy, but cool.” Emily rolled her eyes.
 “Boys, I still don’t know how they find this interesting.” She pointed to Jason and Seth, who were continuing to guess random names to describe the arch.

It's my fault that this all happened."
 Alec stopped and tugged me around to face him.
 "Don't be sorry.
 I wish this had happened a long time ago.
 We kept stalling, kept waiting for me to develop the ability to stand Brandon off, and it was the wrong thing to do.
 I should have challenged him when Simon and Nathanial killed the tourists, should have slapped Vincent down the day he almost killed Ben, should have done something a thousand times over, but I just kept waiting.
 Well, I'm finally done waiting, and it's a relief.
 I'll fight Brandon tonight, and one way or another things will finally be resolved."
 I shook my head in denial, unable to contemplate the horror of what he was discussing, but he gently stopped me before I could complete the motion.
 "This isn't your fault.

Don’t know him?
 Anyway, I was sitting there and there was a legal pad on the coffee table because earlier in the day I had tried writing a song about my mother—don’t ask—and it was sitting there like an invitation and I was speeding like a hell-rooster, man, and I just picked up the pad and this big fat marker, I mean I was writing these huge thick letters on the  page (laughs) and I just started, “You were mean to me/Leave me alone, let me sit in my tree/You were a snake, I needed you then/you were like bad heroin.”  And I ripped the whole thing off in about an hour.
 And I recorded it that night in my living room, fingers tearing over my strings till they bled, I was playing so hard, like Richie, and that song, that was recorded in my home—it sounds like it.
 But it was born of anger, and so, well, it’s not one of my faves.
 Lor came back about dawn and I was still up and I was crying, just sitting there crying with the guitar in my lap, and she put her arms around me, and that’s the story of that song.
 Last time I took speed.

"You don't need to do that; I can always just ride the bus."
 Brandon flipped open the passenger door and motioned for me to get in.
 I started around the vehicle, stumbling and nearly falling before I finally made it to my destination.
 Brandon waited for me to get my seatbelt on and then gunned the engine, flipping around a hundred and eighty degrees in a maneuver I'd never seen anyone perform outside of the movies.
 "Of course I don't have to pick you up.
 It's more a matter of wanting to, if I can say that without making things all weird.
 I have obligations at school, people who depend on me.
 I can't spend the time I'd like getting to know you there, so it just made sense to free up some time in the mornings to make that happen."
 Everything was just too unreal.
 I couldn't believe it was all happening, so I chose to ignore the implications of what he was saying.

Employment Strategies for the Industrial Nations
 In the industrial countries, the phenomena of jobless growth coupled with persistently high rates of youth unemployment and of chronic unemployment among the poorer sections will not be eradicated by even the most optimistic rates of economic expansion or mere incremental adjustments within the context of present attitudes and policies.
 Although the problem has been aggravated by a variety of short- and medium-term factors whose effects will gradually dissipate over time – defence cuts, recession, East European economic crisis, German reunification, etc.
 – the present job crisis among Western nations is largely structural in nature.
 Although conditions vary from country to country, the crisis impacts most heavily on the unskilled, young people, urban poor, ethnic minorities and older workers.
 Specific programmes to effect structural changes will have to be introduced in order to ensure a fair opportunity to all, especially minority youth, to lead economically active lives.
 It is in this context that the European Union, the United States and other Western governments have been considering ambitious proposals for addressing this issue.
 The Australian government has unveiled a $4.6 billion jobs package to reduce unemployment from 10 per cent to 5 per cent by the end of the decade by encouraging training for the young, the unskilled and the long-term unemployed.
 Recently the OECD has presented the main planks of an employment strategy to stimulate economic growth in the industrial nations, make labour markets more flexible, increase productivity, and revamp employment and unemployment security provisions.
 The relative success of the US economy in creating jobs during the past decade has prompted other countries to emphasize the importance of policies to increase the flexibility of wage rates and bring down the price of labour by reductions in the statutory minimum wage.

Head in the clouds half of the time or not, she'd still freak out.
 Heck, I was already freaking out enough for the both of us.

Aurelia thrust her right hand forward, her fingers spread wide and stiff.
 Words of power poured from her lips, and without hesitation the forest obeyed.
 Vines shot from the earth and wrapped around Harruq’s arms and legs.
 Down he went.
 Aurelia gave him no chance to recover.
 She raised her outstretched hand higher.
 More and more vines appeared, covering the half-orc’s arms and legs with green.
 They lifted him into the air, his boots dangling two feet above the ground.
 Harruq bellowed like a bull caught in a cage.
 He jerked against his restraints but they held firm.

Brandon greeted them with a handshake that turned into a hug.
 He thanked them.
 I think the arrest helped him realize how long the police had been after him and how much they knew about him and that dealers he knew were working for the police.
 After rehab when his head was clear, and he knew how close he came to dying or going to prison, I think he respected what the police were doing.
 By then, several more of his friends had died from an OD or were in rehab or prison.
 We chatted and the officers said that they called Brandon the “one percent kid” due to his progress through recovery.
 They also joked about how I was still the talk of the narcotics and uniform officers as this crazy father who went undercover to save his son’s ass.
 It was an odd gathering but I know the officers enjoyed it and I know they appreciated that their efforts had a positive result on someone.
 While we had Brandon home for this brief time we also attended a family wedding.
 The four of us, Brandon, Bryce, Lisa and myself, drove together several hours north to a coastal town in northern California.

Do you mind if I give you a ride home on Tuesdays and Thursdays?"
 Did I mind?
 Of course not.
 "That would be really great.
 Thanks for offering."
 Brandon ran one finger down the side of my face, and then leaned back with a smile as I reached for the door.
 It wasn't until I was out of the car that I realized our Jeep was parked in its normal spot off to the side of the house.
 Excited to talk to Mom about her last outing, I waved goodbye to Brandon and hurried to the door.
 Mom hardly even looked up from her laptop as I walked in.
 Whew, no need to go through the third degree about Brandon.

 "We-we went to the--we went shopping.
 He bought me clothes and all kinds of interesting things.
 And he held me, Mother."
 She looked into her mother's eyes earnestly.

I am always in control, so don’t fear what I do.
 But I must learn, Harruq.

 Nevertheless, death…‌death has a way of teaching us things.
 I can sense its power so clearly in its presence.

 Harruq crossed his arms and stared into the corner.
 “People die every day here,” he said.
 “Shall I find their bodies and bring them to you?”

Needing to push the feeling away, she rose and started to clear the table.
 "Don't."
 Rick took the dishes from her.
 "We're not going to spend our last hours together doing dishes."

 She smiled.

The pendant against my chest seemed to glow at my revelation.
 I ran.
 As I raced from the chamber, I couldn’t tell if anyone had even noticed.
 They all appeared to be staring at the speaker but, regardless, I concentrated furiously on not being followed.
 Do not catch me, do not find me, let me go, I was almost chanting in my thoughts.
 Out the building, out of the village, running as fast as I could, I kept thinking it over and over and over.
 I didn’t know where I would go, I just wanted away.
 I found myself heading in the same direction I had the day before.
 But hiding in a briar patch wouldn’t work this time.
 They would come for me.

His father had imparted to him all he had learned in his lifetime and all their ancestors had passed down before.
 They bred the animals methodically, striving to combine certain traits, bring them together in a single horse.
 With each generation, they strengthened the line, even bringing in new breeds from other lands to add to the list of desired attributes.
 Smoother gait, better endurance, stronger health, longer life.
 I faded off somewhere during the part about bloodlines.
 I woke late in the evening when Ruby switched places with Steed.
 She had brought some meat back with her and we supped together before I headed off to bed.
 Ruby didn’t question why I would be sleeping again so soon.
 She was busy being excited about her upcoming trip.
 I didn’t share her enthusiasm, so I retired to my room and read more of the journal.

This was her house?
 I was sure I was wearing the same irritated look as Chevelle now.
 I was also certain, by the way she watched me, that Ruby had seen me spying.
 Her mouth was twisted in a smile, loaded with false honey.
 I noticed her eyes then, looking past the heavy paint they wore, to dark green jewels… emeralds.
 They were so like those I had just examined in the mirror that I had to look away.
 “Frey,” I replied softly.
 “Thank you for the room.” She seemed disappointed I had no further comment.
 She flitted her hand in dismissal as she swirled out of the room and back to Chevelle, the metal bracelets around her wrists tinkling like chimes.

Now please put me down."
 Alec looked at me doubtfully, then took a deep, no doubt calming breath, and shrugged.
 The movement seemed too casual, almost as if he was angry, but trying to hide it.
 I wanted to try and make eye contact to test my hypothesis, but was afraid of what I'd see.
 The tingling was spreading, no doubt a bad sign.
 Maybe I'd hit my head even harder than I thought.
 "It was all just a game for you, wasn't it?"
 There was anger behind the voice now, subtle, like the scent of rain the night before a storm, but definitely there.
 I started to bristle; I even took a breath to explain what'd really happened.
 Only the truth wasn't any better than the story he'd fabricated.

Wondering why, after I had spilled my guts, he appeared to revel in my further humiliation, I flew into a rage, sprang to my knees, and socked him in the stomach.
 I pounced on top of him and socked him again, before he caught hold and flipped me, lashed my arm behind my back and shoved my face into the floor.
 “Listen,” he said, without a hint of condemnation, “you’re not really mad at me.
 You’re mad at yourself, because you think you’re nobody, but you’ve got it all wrong.

During normal periods of slow and gradual change, the impact or role of other dimensions operates below the surface and appears minimal.
 Economists studying the results of economic variables tend to overlook the influence of factors from other fields on the assumption that non-economic factors are constant.
 Under relatively stable and static conditions, these economics principles can be employed to predict changes in economic variables to a considerable extent.
 But under circumstances in which underlying economic, social and political conditions are undergoing radical change, the relevance and predictive capacity of purely economic concepts is quite limited.
 This was the situation confronting the states of the region at the beginning of the transition period, and the reason why the actual results of the reform differed so drastically from what had been anticipated.
 The situation in Eastern and Central Europe was further complicated by the disproportionately large size and importance of the defence sector in the economy.
 This necessitates, not only a change from one economic system to another, but also a restructuring of the entire economy from a defence orientation to a consumer orientation.
 This change in structure could not be brought about by reliance on macro-economic policy.
 2.Political and social consensus is essential for rapid social change: In a democratic society, the market cannot be instituted by decrees or authoritarian methods which belong to the old sys tem.
 In the new political climate, reforms will be successful only in the measure that they are understood and accepted by the population.

but it wasn't right.
 She was betrothed to Davis.
 She couldn't kiss another man.
 Reluctantly she pulled away.
 "I guess we should finish washing your car."
 "OK."  His eyes focused on her lips.
 His tiny bit of contact with them had been electric.
 He suspected that if he persisted, he could break down her resistance, but he cared about her too much to do that.
 Marie couldn't stop thinking about Rick's kiss.
 It had been brief, but she could remember everything about it in vivid detail.

Tears streamed silently as I drifted, the ache in my chest only dulled by exhaustion.
 I felt weak when I woke, but I was silent about the pain as we continued the journey.
 Yearning to avoid my thoughts altogether, I spent much of the day in the mind of my horse.
 And the day passed.
 It was evening again when we stopped.
 I barely noticed the group’s mood; though quiet, they seemed anxious and kept the perimeter close.
 Ruby brought me the book again and I took one long, deep breath before I started back.
 Freya is growing and strong.
 She has amassed a following of sorts, though I suspect it is somehow connected to her frailties.
 There is something endearing about it, but some of it worries me.

Chevelle.
 I opened my eyes and realized he had swept debris from my face.
 I wiped a hand across my forehead and dried mud crumbled away.
 I looked down; it was caked on the fabric of my pants and splattered nearly everywhere.
 Moving to the edge of the bank to walk in, clothes and all, I waded out until I was waist deep and then relaxed, falling back and gliding under the dark water before it lifted me to float at the surface.
 The water covered my ears, lapping at my mouth and chin, and I stared upward, marveling at the size of the mountains as they seemed to dissolve into the blue haze of the sky.
 I wondered if it would ever seem real.
 Eventually, I made my way back, wrapping my arms around myself to control the shivers.
 I was surprised and more than a little grateful to find a shelter had already been set up for me.
 The idea of being drenched hadn’t mattered until the cool air cut across the lake.

“I promise.
 Happy?”
 “Far from it.”
 Aurelia crossed her legs, tossed back her hair, and then leaned her head on her hands as she stared into the fire.
 “I want you to listen to me, alright Harruq?”
 “Sure.”
 He glanced down, uncomfortable and saddened that Aurelia refused to look him in the eye.
 “Velixar is not who you think he is.
 He isn’t _what_ you think he is.
 He tried to kill me, Harruq.

He stood and started toward me, about to speak again—just as the door swung open.
 Chevelle’s face flushed with anger.
 “Elfreda!” Steed was through the door and to me in three long strides.
 He grabbed me at the waist, picking me up and spinning me so that my cloak swirled behind.
 The shock and exuberance of his greeting was too much and I couldn’t help but let out a breathless laugh.
 He put me down but kept me close, his hands still at my waist.
 “Steed,” I said, very nearly winded.
 “What are you doing here?” He glanced at Chevelle, who was still plainly annoyed, and his carefree smile dissolved.
 “I was heading to Bray and ran across some trackers.” Chevelle’s eyes flicked to my face and then back to Steed.
 Steed dropped his hands from my waist as he winked at me.

“I guess we’re jumping down.” “Why would we do that?” “Because,” he said and sat on the side, “we don’t have a rope.” Then he jumped.
 *** Life is good when you don’t have to worry about anything and everything is calm and peaceful.
 Well that’s not my life.
 My life isn’t peaceful by any standards.
 It involves lots of smart remarks and bad decisions involving life or death.
 It also involves a bad choice of a place where you roll around pretending like your life could be normal for a second.
 Yeah… Seth sat up quickly and looked around.
 He must have heard it too.
 The ground rumbled in the distance and I didn’t know if it was an earthquake or a stampede of elephants.
 “What’s going on?” I asked.

I watched as my new co-workers trickled out, and then looked around at the nearly empty room.
 Rachel was still sitting at her desk in the middle of the room, and Britney was still pouting from her new, assigned seat.
 "Let's go."
 I shook my head.
 "I told Mrs. Campbell I'd stay the whole time.
 I'm not lying for you or anyone else."
 Rachel piped up unexpectedly.
 "It's okay, Britney.
 If you want to leave we'll give her a ride home."
 I could see the wheels turning in her head.

I could not control my magic; it shattered most of the things on the nearby table and twice caught the bedding afire.
 The elders were frantic, which only frightened me more.
 I had never seen them agitated.
 This carried on for hours.
 My hair and clothing were drenched in sweat and I was near surrender.
 And then, with no more warning than when the first pains came, it was over.
 A small, sweet child was in my arms.
 I drew in ragged breaths as I cleaned her face.
 I wiped her eyes and they came open, an unbelievable shade of dark green, sparkling like emeralds.
 She was a beauty.

He didn’t care if anyone came and saw him, not even his brother.
 His tears fell onto her bloodstained dress.
 For far too long, she did not move.
 His heart cried out in agony.
 It was too late.
 He had killed her.
 “I’m so sorry,” he whispered to her.
 “Forgive me, please, if you can…”
 “What are you babbling about?” the elf asked, her eyes cracking open.

But the claim itself is based on a limited and superficial interpretation of history.
 The fall of the Berlin Wall marks the end of a confrontation between two divergent systems that have been struggling toward reconciliation throughout the present century – one based on the human right to freedom and the determinism of the free market, the other based on the right to basic economic security and the determinism of the state.
 One has made people subservient to the needs of the state, the other has left them subject to the whims of the market.
 True communism has never existed.
 What lived and has finally died in Eastern Europe is not communism, but statism, the domination of the state and use of state authority to govern the life of the nation, in practice reducing people to forced labour.
 True capitalism, which regards people as a factor of production, passed away more than half a century ago, when the challenge of communism prompted Western societies to incorporate socialist principles and measures to mitigate the blind justice of the free market.
 There are no true capitalist societies in the world.
 There are no free markets.
 The free market system is highly regulated and controlled by the very state over which it claims victory.
 But although in reality both systems are dead, the ideology of the capitalist system lives on and casts an illusory impression of supremacy.

I glanced up at him timidly.
 “Thank you,” I croaked as I took the cup, my hand trembling.
 “Shouldn’t have left you alone,” he said quietly.
 There was a tinkling laugh in the front room and I groaned.
 She was here, too.
 The water helped.
 I was able to sit up with Chevelle’s assistance.
 Ruby swirled into the room, dressed in a red frock of sorts.
 The color hurt my eyes.

The other half-orc remained at the door, his eyes not leaving the gray outside.
 “He’s not sending for us,” Harruq said.
 “You are correct,” said Velixar’s voice, startling both of them.
 They turned to see their master emerge from the shadows of their home, his red eyes gleaming.
 “How did you get in here?” the warrior asked.
 “Listen to me,” Velixar said, ignoring the question.
 “I have little time.

“What are you thinking about?” she repeated.
 “Surely you must be thinking something; we’re going to some ‘other world’!” I closed my eyes.
 “I was just wondering what it would be like in Igneeria.
 What about you?” “Well,” she said thoughtfully, “I was thinking about Kojas-” “Emily don’t say his name, I don’t feel like being yelled at again.” I interrupted her.
 “Fine,” she said, a little annoyed.
 “I was thinking about him, if I must call him that, and what he’s like.” I rolled my eyes.
 “Emily isn’t it obvious; he’s evil for crying out loud.
 That’s why we have to go and stop him.” “I know that Jazell, gosh, but I was wondering what he looks like.” “I don’t want to know,” I said.
 Emily twirled her hair, “I know but I’m just curious.” I bit my lip.
 “If we do end up fighting this guy, you’ll get your wish.” Minutes later, Jason emerged from the trees and dropped his travel bag on the ground.

The only time I'd ever seen a bodyguard physically push their client around was when some up-and-coming soap star had a bottle thrown at her by the wife of someone she was sleeping with.
 I looked past Brandon, expecting to see something threatening headed towards us.
 I even opened my mouth to warn Brandon, but there wasn't anything there, just Brandon, still with the same casual smile as he reached out and squeezed my arm.
 "Hi, guys.
 I just thought I'd see if Adri needed a ride home."
 It was like I'd been hit by a bus.
 My arm tingled at the same time my heart started skipping beats.
 My body was trying to shut down as a panic attack loomed on the horizon, but not succeeding because it was also revving up from standing so close to Brandon.
 I think I said goodbye to Rachel and James.
 I kind of fuzzed out.

The image in the mirror was stunning.
 It felt odd to marvel over my own reflection, but I couldn’t pretend I didn’t like it.
 The changes were still unnerving though, and I tried to remember what I looked like in my oldest memories, to see before, to see my mother’s face.
 The door opened behind me.
 “Ah, yes,” Ruby purred as she looked me over.
 “Lovely.” Her inflection left no doubt the word was not a compliment, only that she found it lovely she’d discovered me here.
 I could see Chevelle through the open door behind her, still in the main room and evidently annoyed.
 “I, of course, am Ruby,” she said.
 “I’m pleased you’ll be staying with me during your visit.” Staying with her?
 This was her house?

“Mixed, of course, human, AElfin.
 But, Rodregas, they have Forest and Earth Nymphs and several are children.
 I was raised among AElfin, but these are my people.
 I wish we could do something.“ Rodregas nodded his understanding and said, “I wish we could, but the three of us against a score, the chances of our success is far smaller than the chances of our death.” He stated in the ‘matter of fact’ sergeant voice that he knew people would follow.
 Rodregas stood up and started to turn, but while Doi’van stood he faced the road and he said, “I have been on this road before, though I did not know then that it was called ‘The Princess Road.’ To me it was a road of sorrow.” Doi’van was using that flat voice that he used when stating facts.
 “Rodregas, you said our odds are bad, but how long shall we wait for the odds to be good?” Doi’van’s voice dropped the flat tone and started to sound like rocks groaning deep in the earth, as if a great earthquake was coming, “You believe that a god of the Celestials is behind your survival and that this god wants to see us fight the Immortalists.
 I spent two years of my life in the Menagerie, I swore to myself that given a chance I would see no others be enslaved by the Lord Taiga.” Doi’van continued speaking with the same tone as if the earth shook, “I know these caravans.
 The guards will be mostly badly trained human scum armed in leather and with weapons of simple steel.
 The Immortalist scouts are another matter.
 They will be highly trained but still the lowest of the Immortal Guards, mostly with just one or two of the lesser sigils such as strength or one that gives him enhanced senses.

In formulating the ideas and recommendations incorporated in this report, it has been our objective to avoid utopian and idealistic prescriptions that are incapable of being translated into practice in the foreseeable future.
 At the same time, we have refused to be confined by what is presently considered realistic and practicable, because both intuition and recent experience confirm that our conception of what is real and achievable are themselves often the expression of limited and short-sighted perceptions.
 Disclaimer
 Due to the diversity and complexity of the views examined by the Commission, and the heterogeneous mix of Commission members drawn from a wide range of countries, backgrounds and professions, it has not been possible to arrive at consensus on all the views discussed in this report.
 Five years of research and discussion have created a much greater commonality of perspective, but there are still significant differences among members regarding specific views and recommendations presented in this report.
 However, all the Commissioners agree with the basic emphasis on social and gender equity, job-led growth and human security.
 Members share the conviction that a candid and challenging discussion of these issues is more valuable than representation of a consensus view.
 The Next Millennium
 We are on the threshold of a new millennium.
 All civilizations have recognized the special significance of new beginnings – the dawn of a new day, a new year, a new century.

He looked at my mother, his grandmother “Grammy” and apologized for putting her through the same nightmare a second time, as she had been through this with my older brother, Thomas.
 He looked at Uncle Thomas and thanked him for getting him into a program that saved his life.
 He thanked staff members and students by name, as he looked them directly in the eyes.
 He made amends to all of us and he unsuccessfully tried to fight back the tears as he continued.
 He spoke candidly about all of the lessons he had learned to help him deal with a life without the need for drugs.
 He talked about how he had learned to deal with the nightmares and guilt he once drowned in drugs.
 I never thought such words of wisdom and reflection would ever come out of his mouth but they did.
 We all sobbed uncontrollably as we could now understand what demons he fought and how our son was back.
 We could finally understand drug addiction.
 A group hug involving our entire family erupted during the ceremony as Brandon finished speaking.

Famine attracts media coverage, political and public attention, but chronic hunger does not.
 With global food surpluses accumulating, an organized effort can ensure food security for people everywhere.
 The challenge of achieving food security for all human beings is complex, for it depends on the interaction between multiple factors – technological initiatives to produce sufficient food; economic initiatives to stimulate sufficient employment opportunities and increase purchasing power; political initiatives to maintain a peaceful and stable environment, undisturbed by war or social unrest that can interfere with food distribution; and administrative initiatives to provide for those who are unable to provide for themselves due to poverty or during times of emergency.
 Peace, democracy, employment and food security are mutually interdependent.
 The efforts proposed to promote peace, democracy and employment generation will mitigate the problem of food security to a considerable extent.
 In addition, Chapter Five of the Commission’s report highlights direct interventions that are needed to address the problem at the level of agricultural productivity, among which the following are particularly relevant in the present context:
 Farm Productivity: The attraction of high technology service industries should not blind us to the fact that a large section of humanity still depends on agriculture as its main source of income and livelihood.
 Farm productivity in these countries is typically less than a fourth or fifth the average attained by other countries.
 Low agricultural productivity results in high cost food, low rural incomes and limited employment opportunities, both on farm and in downstream industries.
 As a revolution in agricultural productivity provided the impetus for rapid industrialization in Britain and later USA in the 19th Century, rapid modernization of agricultural technology, a shift to commercial crops, improved linkages for credit, marketing and processing can act as a catalyst for employment generation and economic growth in many developing countries today.

Nuzzling his ear, she told him, "It's probably wrong for me to tell you these things.
 But I want to tell you everything.
 I want you to know how I feel."
 Rick pulled her onto his lap and began devouring her mouth.
 If he didn't know better, he'd swear she was the most cunning seductress he'd ever known.
 Her innocence combined with her confession was a powerful aphrodisiac.
 She was so trusting and yet so passionate, her mouth as hungry as his, her hands caressing and clutching and clawing at his chest and shoulders and neck.
 Hadn't she understood a word he'd said?
 Rick let the embrace go on for as long as he could.
 Then he ended it abruptly, setting her on the sofa and holding himself away from her.

 They had two days left, and Marie chose to spend Thursday wandering around downtown Los Angeles, buying trinkets in the shops and the Farmer's Market on Fairfax and watching glamorous people walk by as she and Rick ate lunch at an outdoor café on Rodeo Drive.
 But her choice for their last day in California was quite a change from that: she wanted to go to Disneyland.
 Mickey Mouse hadn't been around in 1927, and she found the whole idea of a fantasy land for children exciting.
 And she loved Splash Mountain.
 "Are you sad to be leaving?"
 Rick asked that evening as he watched her pack.
 "Yes.
 This has been a dream-come-true, and I'd like to stay in the dream."
 With a sigh she folded her baja and put it in her suitcase.

Developing countries will cut agricultural tariffs by an average of 24 per cent.
 In addition, North American and Western European countries have agreed to cut agricultural subsidies by one-third.
 Together these cuts are expected to result in a 20 per cent rise in exports of agricultural and processed foods by 2005.
 The share of developing countries in this increase has been estimated at $20 billion to $60 billion annually.
 Increased trade can act as a strong stimulus to the growth of agricultural, agro-industrial and rural employment, provided that these countries respond dynamically to the opportunity by raising productivity and strengthening rural infrastructure for storage, processing and distribution.
 However, rising demand within developing countries themselves will limit overall growth of exports, and increasing exports will push up domestic food prices, unless much greater priority is given to matching production with opportunities for home and external trade.
 Increased private investment
 The modernization of the farm sector greatly needs the investment, technology, professional management and marketing expertise which private firms can bring.
 Wherever land reforms have resulted in the division of farms into small parcels, farmers need to be supported by well-organized services, particularly for post-harvest handling, provided either by companies or co-operatives.
 Economic liberalization offers expanded opportunities for private enterprise to work with small producers in a wide range of agro-industries to combine the social benefits of small holdings with the economies and marketing expertise of corporate management.

I wrung my hair out.
 “I agree and if we didn’t need them, I’d be planning their funeral.” Emily smiled, “I’d be helping you.
 Do you think they would like pink coffins?” “Totally,” I laughed and grabbed my dry bag.
 “Let’s go home.
 Want to crash at my place?” Emily flipped open her phone, her fingers danced on the keys and paused.
 Then they clicked and she shoved it in her pocket.
 “Yup I can.” “You’re always one step ahead.” “Always.” “So what do you think we should do?” Emily asked from my bed later on.
 I swallowed the bit of strawberry that had been in my mouth.
 “I don’t know, ambush them back?” “They might see that coming,” she pointed out, “and it’s really obvious.” “Well, they think we won’t do that because that is exactly what they would be expecting, so by actually doing it, we can trick them,” I rambled on and grabbed another strawberry.
 Emily tapped her lip with her pencil and straightened her pink pajamas.

I've visited a few larger cities, but never for long enough to get the full feel for what it must be like to live in a Minneapolis or a New York.
 Someday maybe though."
 This time I was going to pry, but he preempted my question.
 "It looks like we'd better be going or we'll both be late."
 Les Misérables.
 I managed to put the impending drawing more or less out of my mind for the first half of the day, but I actually missed Britney's constant gossip.
 There was almost no redeeming value to most of what she said, but it did have the benefit of being distracting.
 By the time lunch finally came around I needed some kind of distraction.
 This was my only chance to see Les Misérables performed live before I turned forty.
 Unfortunately, while the conversation at Brandon's table was plentiful, it wasn't very distracting.

The museums, the opera, the food.
 They were perfect gentlemen.
 On our way home, strung out on fatigue and more coffee, I babbled about how, guided by Kerouac, we had risen above routine, learned to outrun the sheep and phonies and to create our own destiny.
 “We’re well on our way to being Supermen,” I boasted.
 I prophesied that as soon as we got released from high school and were no longer branded juveniles, life would turn into a banquet.
 Eric mostly sat quiet.
 As we sped past the strawberry fields of Santa Maria, he said, “You know what they say about there’s no free lunch?” “Yeah.” “Suppose they’re right.
 Then who’s going to pay for the banquet, for all this freedom?”
 A Big Change
 Though I continued to long for Karen Flagstad, I began to roam.

“Half,” Harruq whispered as he wiped blood from his swords onto the grass.
 “Only half.”
 The kill had been quick, just a single cut through the shoulder blade, the heart, and then the lung.
 No suffering, little pain.
 It was all he could offer.
 “He’s dead, Qurrah,” the half-orc shouted.
 His deep voice, like a bear’s growl, seemed right at home in the forest.
 “Come on over.”
 Qurrah approached through the trees, clutching a worn bag in his long fingers.
 His brown eyes glanced over the dead boy.

9.Inland aquaculture.
 Depletion of deep sea fishery resources has resulted in a significant decline in world harvests from the sea.
 Proven technology is available for substantially replacing sea-grown fish with fresh or salt water pond-grown varieties.
 The new intensive and semi-intensive methods of cultivation can generate yields 10 to 100 times higher than traditional extensive methods.
 Due to the warmer climate and lower labour costs of the developing world, inland aquaculture can become a major stimulus to rural employment, incomes, processing industries and exports.
 10.Micro-level indicators of food security.
 Development initiatives have been severely limited by the absence of accurate and sensitive measures to assess the impact of national-level policies and programmes on food security at community and household level.
 New indices, such as the Sustain able Livelihood Security Index now under development in India, need to be evolved and applied; they should combine measures of income and employment; food and nutritional status, including the availability of safe drinking water and sanitation facilities; ownership of productive assets; and education and productive skills.
 The pace of human development continues to accelerate.
 The world has changed more during the present century than in the previous nineteen centuries combined – economically, socially, politically, scientifically and technologically.

The others in the car hadn’t gotten scratched, she said, and waited for an assurance that I wouldn't collapse or fly into a rage.
 I asked her if I could go meet Billy and Cliff.
 Knowing which way they would walk to the office from their auto shop class, around behind the football field, I took that route.
 The teacher was engaged with a carburetor and didn’t notice me trespassing in his class.
 I found Billy and Cliff wearing goggles, huddled over the head to a Chevy, grinding the valves.
 They had decided Mrs. Bole and whatever trouble they were in could wait.
 They had one more valve to grind.
 Then we stepped out into the sunlight.
 While I gave them the news, Cliff kicked gravel with both feet.
 Billy stared at the sky.

While a story about how someone tricked some poor girl into thinking he was going to ask her out was highly illuminating, it wasn't particularly the kind of thing I wanted to dwell on.
 Especially considering how many parallels there were between her story, and mine.
 I kept looking at the clock, and the later it got, the more certain I was that Principal Gossil was just about to get on the loudspeaker and call out the winners of the drawing.
 The last two minutes of lunch dragged on forever, but then the bell rang and I was left sitting stunned as Brandon and his friends stood to go.
 I let Brandon help me to my feet, hardly noticing the way his touch left my hand tingling, and headed off to class.
 It was stupid, but I couldn't help feeling this was yet another sign I wasn't going to win a ticket.
 I tried to shake the feeling during History, but was still fighting it when I walked into Physics.
 In a departure from his normal routine, Alec was already seated when I arrived.
 I flipped open my notebook and tried to distract myself with a brief sketch, only to tear the page out and ball it up as the bell rang.
 I looked up to see Alec staring at me, which just made me mad.

“I’m not blind,” she said, suddenly looking away.
 “Not stupid, either.
 I don’t know why I’m here.
 Lie to me if you must, just don’t expect me to believe it.
 Forgive me for hoping you could trust me.”
 The vines released, freeing the half-orc who smacked against the ground.
 By the time he picked himself up, the vines had pulled into the dirt.
 “I have something new planned for tomorrow,” she said.
 “Don’t be late.”
 “You’re going to pay for that,” he grumbled, rubbing his sore wrists after she was gone.

And when she left, he'd be devastated.
 But remembering the excitement on her face as she'd danced with the actor, he couldn't regret it.
 The next day they went to Universal Studios.
 "This is set up like an amusement park," Rick told her as he bought their tickets.
 "So even if it isn't authentic, I think you'll enjoy it."
 "I know I will."
 In reality, she wasn't sure.
 The term "amusement park" conjured up visions of carousels and ferris wheels.
 Those were fun in 1927, but she expected more from 2011.
 She wasn't disappointed.

he asked after they'd sat down and begun eating.
 "Mmm."
 She swallowed and licked her lips.
 "This is heavenly.
 Would you like a bite?"
 "No thank you.
 But try some of this.
 See if it's as good as the chocolate."
 She let him feed her a bite.
 "It's good," she decided, "but it can't compare with chocolate."

“Harruq, I want you to make me a promise.”
 “And what is that?”
 Aurelia leaned back and tucked a few strands of hair behind her ear as high above the stars sparkled sadly.
 “Promise you will never strike at me, or those close to me, ever again.”
 The half-orc shifted uncomfortably in the grass.
 “You know I’d never do that.”
 “No, Harruq, I don’t know.
 I think I know, I desperately want to believe I know, but I don’t.
 So promise me.”

“This is it,” Harruq said as he gestured about the small clearing he and Aurelia sparred in.
 “Where is she?” Qurrah asked.
 Harruq shrugged in response.
 “She’s never here.
 She always shows up after I do.”
 The smaller half-orc scanned the area, seeing no sign of the elf.
 “Perhaps she is not coming,” Qurrah offered.
 “You are late, after all.
 On the other hand, perhaps I scared her off.
 I do have a creepy aura about me, wouldn’t you agree?”

“Tomorrow,” Aurelia said.
 “Early morning.”
 Harruq nodded, his whole body fidgeting.
 Now that he’d found her he wanted nothing more than to escape.
 He was supposed to thank her and go, not be mocked and ordered around.
 “Go on home,” Aurelia said.
 “I’ll be waiting for you.”
 He did as commanded, and that fact disturbed him greatly.
 Qurrah was awake when he returned.
 “Where have you been?” he asked.

I crept up and peered at where he was pointing.
 A bunch of dwarves and tall, muscular men crowded around something.
 The men had double swords sheathed on their back, long ears, and long black hair.
 They were wearing some type of combat boots and thick coats.
 One of them moved and I saw a tied dragon staked to the ground.
 It continued to try to stand but it seemed to weak and fell back down.
 I heard Emily gasp in horror and I felt the same way.
 One of the men poked it in the side with the butt of his sword and the dragon grunted in pain.
 I looked over my shoulder at Emily.
 She looked like she was about to start crying any second.

“Did you revel in the power granted to you?” Qurrah asked.
 Harruq paused, searching for an honest answer.
 “Aye,” he said at last.
 “I did.”
 “Then why do you now question it?”
 Harruq shrugged.
 “Velixar’s strong.
 What do you think he wants with us?”
 “Order,” Qurrah said.
 “We will kill, brother.

When she looked up, she smiled nervously.
 She had no family present.
 She told everyone how her mother told her how ugly she was her whole life and told her she was worthless, how she attempted to numb the pain with the drugs she took.
 How she became addicted to the drugs, and prostituted herself to pay for her habit.
 She said that she took all the drugs she could because she knew she would never be alive to see her twenty-first birthday.
 She smiled and announced that she was now twenty-one.
 She thanked one staff member after another and one student after another, each for something specific they had contributed to her healing.
 She said she now felt worthwhile, beautiful and confident.
 She had learned how to manage the demons in her head.
 She was beautiful and it shocked me that she had ever considered anything else and to the point that she tried to destroy herself.

But with the two of them the oath seemed different, more easily said and with no need for threats.
 Rodregas was not sure why, but he decided it was something to think about when he had more time.
 The rest of the night passed quickly as Rodregas did his best to bandage his stomach wound.
 He did not think the knife had cut into anything too important; at least it was not bleeding too badly.
 He was surprised that he was not more tired; maybe his new body handled such things better and could make do with less sleep.
 He was usually a light sleeper and was very surprised that they had been able to get the drop on him.
 His guess was that the AElf maiden had cast some sort of spell on him to mask their approach, and he kept a close eye on her to make sure she did not repeat the effort.
 Of course she was also very nice to look at, so he did not need much of an excuse to enjoy the view.
 In the morning, he slowly pulled out some of the supplies and bundled them.
 He tried not to show how much he hurt.

The others came to his aid, swinging careful, tentative blows.
 All three tried to engage without being put at risk, much like men prodding a bull.
 Of course, the result was similar.
 The bull got madder.
 “If you’re gonna fight me, fight me!” he yelled.
 He ignored several strikes, accepting the cuts so he could close the distance between him and his opponent.
 The sound of steel was quick and brutal, but after the humiliation against Dieredon, Harruq felt as if his opponent moved through sand.
 At the end of three seconds, both of his blades had found flesh.
 The guard fell at his feet, bleeding from a severed arm and a gutted belly.
 Soaked in blood, Harruq turned to the remaining guards and bellowed like the mad beast he was.

 Marie awoke at dawn the next morning and jumped into her clothes.
 She was halfway down the stairs when she remembered she'd promised Rick that she'd wake him up so that he could stay within earshot of her.
 "Rick," she called, tapping on his door.
 "Rick."
 "Just a minute."
 Seconds later his door opened, and he blinked down at her sleepily.
 "You're already dressed?"
 "Yes."

I'd been busy contemplating what Mrs. Campbell might have really figured out as we left the building, only to have Jasmin interrupt my musings with an apology of all things.
 She didn't get into specifics, and it was obvious she was still worried about the coming showdown with Brandon, but I was pretty sure she really was sorry.
 It didn't make us best friends and she was still an enigma, but it was a start.
 It even gave me hope maybe Jessica and James might eventually come around.
 I was still reeling in surprise as we walked out to the parking lot and met up with the rest of the pack, or rather the rest of the pack minus Alec.
 He'd shown up several minutes later, looking very satisfied with himself, but obviously unwilling to answer any questions.
 As we caravanned home, I realized the collection of vehicles carrying us back to Alec's estate probably cost more than my house.
 Donovan had met us at the door and conducted us to the dining room, where Alec and his friends devoured a sizable meal.
 Even back when I'd had a more substantial appetite, I still couldn't have kept up with the wolves.
 Even the girls packed away more food than I would've believed possible for such slender frames.

“Though I did read once that there was a way to steal life force and use it for yourself.” Chevelle shot her a stern rebuke from the front of the pack.
 She continued as if excusing herself, “But it was merely a fairy’s tale and probably not entirely accurate.” Then, in a lower voice, “It is fun to speculate, though.” I wiped at my cheek to clear the dampness from the mist, mirroring her low tone as I questioned her.
 “How would you steal life force?” “Well, like I said, probably not accurate… but you would have to take the other’s life in order to gain their power.
 Take it in a specific manner.” She noticed Chevelle glaring at her and clamped her mouth shut.
 I waited until he turned back around before I whispered, “Ruby, did you bring the magic book with you?” She smiled.
 “Can I read it?” She winked at me.
 I started to share her grin, but before I could, Chevelle was in front of us, his horse blocking my way.
 I was almost thrown from my saddle when we stopped to avoid running into him.
 He was angry again.
 “Frey.” “What?” “Do you remember the last time you used a spell?” I recalled the smell of burning flesh as the maps cut into my palms.

Unconventional, yes, but nonetheless… interesting.
 I led him to a set of stones to sit, wanting to get answers to all the questions that had been burning in my mind since I had spotted them.
 He had forgotten his prey, so I offered to help him with it.
 This befuddled him, so I simply skinned and spitted the animal while he sat, staring in amazement.
 It was like he’d never seen fire before.
 It made the magic fun again.
 Like when we were kids, before Father’s ridiculous schedule.
 I shook off the memory of practice and focused on the human.
 “So, how old are you?” “Twenty-two,” he said, almost shamefacedly.
 At first, I was shocked at the number; I thought maybe I’d misunderstood.

Qurrah felt his nerves fray, and in his gut a sudden confusion swelled.
 He felt as if he hung over the side of a cliff, and the bones he held were the rope.
 The elf let go of his bow and held his hands out to either side.
 “No more have to die,” the elf said.
 The flesh around his eyes sagged wearily, and he leaned against the window to aid in standing.
 It was as if grief had rendered him lifeless.
 Let go, Qurrah thought.
 He could let go.
 Fall down the cliff, and find what awaited him at the bottom.
 All he had to do was let go of the bones.

To her it sounded like the can-opener on warp speed.
 Buddy drew from everywhere, listening with equal fervor to Woody Guthrie, Odetta, Hoagy Carmichael, Django Reinhardt, Coleman Hawkins, Bill Haley, Lonnie Donegan, Howlin Wolf, Eric Dolphy, Skip James, Shostakovich.
 Music fed Buddy the way most of us grew up on oatmeal and peanut butter.
 And he absorbed it all, filtering it through his sensitive system to come out his delicate fingertips as liquid electricity, a sound even today many guitarists cannot duplicate and few can even explain.
 By thirteen he had his own band, made up of less-skilled classmates at Snowden Elementary.
 They called themselves Regulation Footwear and soon were playing gigs at high school dances and other social occasions, at Clearpool, even at an end-of-school year rally at the Overton Park Shell, foreshadowing later triumphs.
 Clearly, it was Buddy people came to see, Buddy who garnered them engagements with older audiences.
 Regulation’s drummer, poor Gyp Leach, could barely keep time on his Sears drumset, taking lessons after school at Guitar & Drum City, just progressing past a four-four beat.
 But word was spreading about this precocious guitarist who sounded like a coup de foudre, this scrawny, pimply 8th grader with licks like a junkyard dog.
 Buddy Gardner.

The rules were, of course, not to fight to the death.
 A knight stood in the middle of the square and would declare the winner of the match.
 Rodregas’ first opponent looked like a grizzled army veteran; he had a red ribbon and a blue ribbon so he was a man of some skill.
 Rodregas knew he had to do well today or he had no chance.
 He stepped into the square.
 The sands of the ground shifted slightly under his weight as he circled his opponent.
 The veteran was clearly taking him seriously, going in slowly with his knees bent and his feet keeping active.
 Rodregas would have no skill advantage here.
 Rodregas was hesitant to bash his sword too much, as it was of average quality.
 While the sword should be fine for his first match, he hoped to be fighting all day today.

 I am headed towards the other end of the parking lot where I know the apartment complex is hiding the marked police cars.
 I move slowly towards the coffee shop and my heart is beating out of my chest.
 So many thoughts are running through my head and I can’t seem to clear them.
 After the millions of thoughts and moments that have haunted me during this evening I begin to focus on my current life, not my past.
 I think of my wife who has been left in silence for nearly four hours.
 I think of my sons, Brandon completely fucked up from his drug addiction and Bryce away at college completely unaware of what is happening and what risk his dad is about to take.
 It occurs to me that Bryce and my wife may never forgive Brandon if something were to happen to me.
 I recall their little league baseball games and soccer teams I coached.
 All of the art projects which we proudly displayed with the help of refrigerator magnets over the years.

 Hours later, they finished and said their goodbyes.
 “See you tomorrow,” Harruq called, sheathing his blades.
 The elf did not reply as she vanished behind the trees.
 He stared after her for a bit, then turned toward home.
 Before he could take two steps, a sudden weight crashed into his side.
 He tumbled best he could, his shoulder absorbing much of the impact.
 His legs tucked underneath him and pushed, shooting him back to his feet.

The tone was so vulnerable and hesitant he almost sounded like another person.
 "The truth is, I've fallen well and truly in love with you."
 Chapter 23 Someone was calling my name, but I really didn't want to wake up.
 I was still so tired, and I'd had the most wonderful dreams.
 They were a little foggy now, but they seemed to have involved Alec coming to my rescue, and then holding my hand as I went to sleep.
 It wasn't until I finally placed the familiar voice that everything started coming back to me.
 I sat up with an abruptness that nearly knocked Alec off of his perch on the edge of my bed.
 Him still being there, looking at me with a barely restrained amusement glimmering in his eyes, calmed my racing pulse.
 "You're still here."
 "You sound disappointed.

Rachel's eyes lit up brighter than I'd seen them in a while.
 "You're welcome.
 Does that mean we can go to Vegas?"
 It seemed like a crime to deny her, but I knew Mom didn't have the spare money to send me on a two-hour trip to an opera.
 I was working now, but by the time I could save up enough to pay for gas, food, and a ticket, the production would've moved on.
 "I'm sorry, I'd like to go, but I just don't think I can.
 If it was running for an extra month or two I could probably save up enough money from tutoring, but it isn't, so it just isn't going to happen."
 Rachel nodded, and for a second it was easy to forget that she probably got more spending money each month than I'd see all year.
 "That's okay.
 Things like that are always coming through Vegas.

“Are you sure what we’re doing isn’t wrong?” He twiddled his fingers, suddenly embarrassed.
 “I mean…‌ they’re children.”
 Qurrah sighed.
 He had sensed apprehension in his brother before, especially when it came to the children.
 Such nuisances needed to be eradicated.
 “If given a choice,” Qurrah asked, “would you split a seed or burn a flower?
 Let the children meet their end before they learn the torment and anguish of their parents.
 Besides, kill a child and the mother has one less mouth to feed.
 Kill the mother or father and all the children suffer and starve.”
 The larger half-orc shrugged.

The sanctity of the sovereign state, like the sanctity of private property in a capitalist society, is a fundamental principle of the nation state system on which the present world community is based.
 Like the protectors of private property, the guardians of the sovereign state vigorously resist each attempt to limit its scope or qualify its power – although in both instances there are obvious and well-recognized limits and qualifications.
 The sensitivity over the issue of sovereignty – especially among former colonies and victims of imperialist aggression – is quite understandable in view of the fact that the emergence of modern nation states over the last two centuries occurred during a period when imperialist wars and colonial conquests were accepted as part of the normal conduct of international relations.
 It is a measure of the world’s progress in this century that this standard of conduct is no longer tolerated by the international community.
 The formulation of current policy on racial memories of past exploitation or persecution is no more appropriate or conducive to human progress, however, than the false conception of policies based on an exaggerated sense of pride or egocentric self-importance derived from the glory of forceful conquest in the past.
 In both instances, attitudes of the past must give way to fresh attitudes oriented to the future.
 Some member states are understandably wary of raising these issues, out of concern that their re-examination could become an excuse for outright political interference in the internal affairs of sovereign nations, a concern which is reinforced by the non-representative character and lack of impartiality of the Security Council.
 Other nations are reluctant to assume the greater responsibilities that a clearly enunciated doctrine might impose on them.
 All would agree, however, that neither an infinite fragmentation of nation states along ethnic, cultural, religious or linguistic lines, nor a blind indifference to persecution or unconscionable neglect of its own citizens by a state government, can be justified by either reason or lofty legal principles, or be permitted by the human heart and conscience to go unchecked.
 The UN is precluded under article 2(7) of the Charter from intervening in ‘matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state’.

Partly for him but mostly for herself.
 What would he say if he knew that she sometimes went to a speakeasy?
 He'd probably kill her.
 Davis, having missed the irony in her tone, took her hand.
 "Why don't we go back to your house and listen to the radio?"
 That idea appealed to her very much.
 Her parents were out, so she and Davis would be alone.
 Normally, she wouldn't dare be alone at home with a man--her father would be furious.
 But he trusted Davis with her.
 They sat close together holding hands as they listened to a mystery program.

Fall down the cliff, and find what awaited him at the bottom.
 All he had to do was let go of the bones.
 The confusion burned hotter in his gut.
 “You’re right,” Qurrah said, standing to his full height.
 “No more have to die.
 But what we do doesn’t matter, for more always will.”
 He opened his hands.
 Fueled by dark magic, the bones shot forth, piercing the elf’s throat and eyes.
 Against the window his dying body fell, his arms still held wide as if offering an embrace that would never be returned.
 Qurrah stared at the corpse, and as the blood pooled on the floor he felt himself standing once more on solid ground.

“Shhhhh, it is all right.
 With me you never have to worry, you never have to be afraid.” He was going to tell her that he would not hurt her, but since she seemed afraid that she would be the one hurting him, he held the comment back.
 He just pulled her close again, but instead of a soft kiss he kept himself from touching her and simply looked deep into her eyes and thought about how much he appreciated her.
 Rodregas let her feel how much he thought of her.
 Only after he saw her eyes make a decision, did he slide his hands down her body and cup the small of her back and pull her into a kiss, but this time he let more of his passion and need show.
 With his kiss her resistance evaporated and she went from hesitant to eager.
 Her hands started pulling at his leather armor, eager to get him naked and feel his skin.
 At her action Rodregas felt awkward.
 This was not really his body that she wanted to touch; he was not really this young handsome man that she felt attracted to.
 He wanted to pull away, but did not let himself.

I thought about kicking, or even screaming, but that would just leave me feeling like a child and give Alec exactly the kind of attention he was probably hoping for.
 "You hit your head pretty hard; I really think we should get you to the office.
 Sir, with your permission?"
 The comment about hitting my head settled me down.
 It wasn't until we were out in the hall that I realized my head didn't hurt.
 That was probably a really bad sign.
 "Let go of my hands."
 Alec unpinned my arms, set me down, and then chuckled as I started gingerly probing my scalp.
 "What are you doing?
 You didn't actually hit your head.

“Of all the dumb luck,” he said, a grin spreading across his face.
 “We got some real elves here!”
 They drew their swords.
 Harruq held an arm defensively in front of Qurrah, his eyes darting in all directions.
 Slowly, the leader extended the stick, poking it against Harruq’s chest.
 The soft glow turned into a brilliant flare of emerald.
 “Elves,” the man said.
 “No doubt about it.”
 He laughed to the others and then punched Harruq in the gut.
 As the half-orc doubled over, the guard grabbed his hair and tugged.

There is no rational or practical obstacle to the immediate adoption of this measure.
 As a starting point, it can be demonstrated that with the right perspective, courage and commitment, practical immediate solutions are possible for any and all of the conflicts presently raging.
 Recent failures of international diplomacy do not contradict this assertion, they confirm it.
 War must, and can, be abolished.
 Nuclear Weapons
 The threats to future peace come in many forms and at many levels, but unquestionably the most pernicious and potentially devastating is the peril from nuclear weapons.
 The end of the nuclear arms race between the superpowers may have removed the looming fear of all-out nuclear war and annihilation that surfaced in the artistic drawings of young American school children in the mid-1980s, but the horrible genie of Hiroshima and Nagasaki will continue to haunt us until every nuclear weapon has been destroyed.
 The very existence of the nuclear stock piles carries its own inherent dynamism for their utilization, which is likely to be expressed intentionally or accidentally sooner or later.
 There have been repeated efforts by the non-aligned nations to move a resolution in the UN General Assembly that the use of nuclear weapons should be declared a crime against humanity and outlawed.
 One hundred and twenty-six nations have voted for the resolution.

This is the all-powerful driving force that has so radically transformed the social landscape during this ‘century of the common man’.
 This is the ultimate ‘rationale’ behind the inevitable claim of the poor everywhere that will be made with ever-growing insistence and impatience until it is finally granted – as the birthright of every human being – freedom, food, education, employment, prosperity and fulfilment for all.
 Perspectives for the New Millennium
 The individual effect, complex linkages, mutually supportive interactions and consequent cumulative impact of these two revolutions and the nine other factors propelling global change are incalculable.
 They make this a rare moment in history for a quantum leap forward, which many have dreamed about but few believed achievable.
 Seizing this opportunity requires, most importantly of all, a change in awareness, attitude and perspective.
 Several ideas will be of abiding value in our endeavour to make the most of this rare moment.
 Our present problems and future potentials can only be understood when viewed from a wider historical perspective that avoids getting lost in the media-driven drama and intensity of momentary crisis and short-term trends.
 As recent global action to protect the environment amply demonstrates, public awareness and understanding are growing too rapidly and becoming too important in global affairs for us to rely on the present positions of governments or current public sentiment as gauges of what may be achieved in the near future.
 More reliable indices of what is possible are the underlying currents that are rapidly raising the value of the human being, bringing nations together in ever-closer co-operation and mutual interdependence, and pressing the international community to raise its goals.

The outermost material was achingly clear, while the inner layers seemed increasingly less so.
 Alec waited, another smile playing about his lips, while I came to terms with the shoes.
 He then deftly slipped the other shoe onto my right foot, and steadied me as I tried to adjust to suddenly being almost six inches taller.
 "They're perfect.
 Thank you."
 Rachel ducked around her brother so she could see the shoes and then smiled before leaning in to whisper.
 "Mom wore those to the Ashure Day Dance, the one where she fell in love with Dad."
 I pulled back in protest, but Alec's grasp on my hand tightened just enough to stop me.
 "She wanted you to wear them.
 They were meant to be worn again tonight."

The experience of the past decade strongly supports the view that a more peaceful global environment is more conducive for development.
 Military spending declined by a third in the years immediately following the end of the Cold War, partly due to real cuts in defence spending and partly due to the collapse of the Russian rouble and changes in the value attributed to Soviet arms spending.
 These real gains did not translate into a significant increase in foreign aid, which was what many hoped and expected.
 But that does not mean there has been no peace dividend.
 A comparison of the performance of the world economy over the past two decades reveals that after an initial recessionary period of economic dislocation, economic performance has improved on the whole in all regions and almost all countries.
 According to IMF, the growth rate in emerging and developing countries rose from 3.7 per cent annually during the period 1985-94 to 5.1 per cent over the following 10 years and is projected to reach 5.9 per cent in 2005.
 In Sub-Saharan Africa, the rise was from 1.9 per cent to 3.9 per cent and it is expected to reach 5.8 per cent in 2005.
 In the former Soviet republics, growth has accelerated from 0.1 per cent to 4.1 per cent and projected to touch 6.6 per cent next year.
 These trends are likely to continue throughout the decade.
 While foreign aid to developing countries as a percentage of GDP has fallen by 50 per cent since 1990, it has been offset to some extent by a 150 per cent rise in foreign investment.

"I want to make love to you more than I want to take my next breath.
 And if you said yes, I'd stop thinking altogether and spend all night making love to you.
 But when all I had left was my memories, I'd feel guilty that I'd taken your virginity and let you go back to 1927 with the guilt I know you'd feel.
 And-and I'd never know if maybe you were pregnant."
 The horrifying thought gripped his mind.
 "If we'd made love, you might have gotten pregnant and then gone back to 1927, and I would never have known that I had a child."
 That thought cooled his desire faster than anything else could have.
 He thought she might have changed her mind about staying if they'd made love—but what if they'd made love and she hadn't?
 Marie began sobbing.
 "I'd love to have your baby."

 Thank you, but you really shouldn't have."
 His smile was back, and for some reason it nearly pulled tears out of me.

Author's Note: In some ways it feels like I've been at this for decades, in other ways it feels like I only just sat down to try and put Adri's story down in words.
 Now that it's live, I can only say that I hope you enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed writing it.
 If you haven't read Torn yet, please go check it out.
 When I set out to write Broken, I never expected that I was going to end up writing the same story from Alec's point of view, but I'm pleased with how both Broken and Torn have turned out, both individually and as a combined work.
 They are done in very different styles, but ultimately that was exactly what I was after.
 I think there is plenty of cross-over of guys reading paranormal romance, and girls picking up more action-packed stories.
 Ultimately I think most of us just want a compelling story, but sometimes the labels that get applied to books get in the way of us discovering them, rather than helping as they are meant to do.
 I think one of the things that made the Harry Potter books so successful was the fact that the whole family could share in the series.
 I remember as Twilight came out thinking that there were plenty of guys who would enjoy Twilight if they ever sat down and read it, but most of them wouldn't ever give it a try.
 My hope with Broken and Torn is that the two stories combine into something that both guys and girls can enjoy.

In this sense, terrorists crudely expose the mental insincerity prevalent in international politics.
 Those who wield national power must come to realize that force of compulsion will not bring about a permanent reconciliation and amelioration of relationships in human affairs.
 Superior power must bring with it a superior sense of fairness and a commitment to constructive dialogue and action to attack the root causes of terrorism.
 It must shed its own accretion of mental insincerity cloaked as diplomacy.
 Then and then only these movements of violence will shrink and finally disappear.
 The period following September 11th, as US National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice put it, is one “not just of grave danger, but of enormous opportunity.”
 Resolving Local Conflicts: The Commission concluded that the end of the Cold War made it possible to successfully resolve problems that had resisted solution for decades, such as the many violent communal and ethnic conflicts occurring in the world.
 The near total cessation of violence in North Ireland during the past 10 years is proof that rapid progress can be made on issues involving apparently intractable communal sentiments.
 This achievement appears astounding to those who lived through the earlier decades of religious violence and until recently found it nearly impossible to imagine a mitigation of the conflict in the foreseeable future.
 We would do well to examine closely this instance to draw lessons that may aid in addressing those conflicts that continue to defy resolution.

In addition, this strategy was pursued at the cost of increasing insecurity to other nations.
 The acquisition of nuclear weapons generates a ripple effect and acts as a powerful force for proliferation.
 The arms build-up has been reversed, but at least 40,000 nuclear weapons are still in stockpiles with a combined explosive force at least 1,000 times greater than all the firepower used in all the wars since the introduction of gunpowder six hundred years ago.
 START-I and START-II will bring down the number of warheads of the United States and the former Soviet Union by 90 per cent from a combined 55,500 total to 6,500 over a ten-year period.
 But this reduction could, in fact, be achieved within months rather than years by deactivating delivery systems and separating their warheads, which could then be stored under multilateral control.
 Nor do these agreements, long overdue and greatly welcome, remove the fundamental dangers and questionable legitimacy of these weapons.
 Even without a decision to abandon completely their use under any circumstances, a further drastic reduction to somewhere between 20 and 200 warheads is more than sufficient to meet any security need.
 Immediate steps can, and should, be taken to negotiate reductions to this minimum level.
 The relaxation of tensions has drawn public attention away from this issue and reduced the momentum for progress at the very time when there is the greatest opportunity finally to eliminate this threat completely.
 The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which ensures the military superiority of the nuclear powers over other signatories, is an instance of rule by strength forcibly imposed by the major powers on the rest of the world community in the name of peace.

Then he quickly reached down and covered Korin’s mouth, pulled him up, and slipped behind him.
 Rodregas saw Korin’s bulging eyes as he tried to get a better look at his captor.
 Korin struggled but not as if his life depended on it.
 He was probably confused.
 The image of the day that Rodregas had started to hate him came back.
 A family of AElves had been taken prisoner; they were just common AElves with no real magic.
 Korin was interested in the father, a good-looking man.
 The wife was equally beautiful and they had a slim child named Jorin.
 Rodregas had taken Jorin under his wing.
 He had only been working at Raven Keep for a little over a year at the time and was still learning the names of the prisoners.

Rodregas then stepped forward, he had to be careful though, he was a good foot taller than his opponent.
 The guard’s long sword gave him better reach.
 Rodregas swung at him and retreated.
 The two shared several blows.
 The third time that he retreated after taking a blow, the guard went for the kill.
 The guard extended his whole body out in a lunge, thrusting his long sword out to its full length.
 The guard saw Rodregas’ braided leather armor and steel sword and thrust with the point.
 The lunge was perfect, the guard went for dead center, and even though Rodregas had been waiting for a similar move, the thrust almost caught him off guard.
 The guard had only one problem, one that he could not have anticipated.
 Rodregas had been taking easy swings, not revealing his true speed.

She looked through the two recipe books he'd bought her but couldn't find anything that appealed to her.
 Maybe she should just prepare something simple and have candlelight and flowers from the garden.
 No--that seemed silly.
 How could she plan a romantic evening when she'd just told him that she couldn't marry him?
 She closed the book with a sigh.
 She loved Rick with a passion she'd never imagined.
 She wanted to marry him.
 But she wanted to go home too.
 She missed her family.
 And she wanted to see Davis again--so she could tell him off.

Harruq sighed and looked away.
 He gently tapped his swords together.
 “I don’t know.
 Bored.”
 “Am I not a challenge?”
 He made vague shrug that could be taken either way.
 Let her think that was it, he thought.
 It was a whole lot better than the truth.
 Aurelia, however, seemed none too pleased.
 She twirled her staff again.

It was a weak explanation, but there was something in his voice that made me believe him.
 The few doubts I still had melted away as I finally met his eyes.
 I've always been pretty good at reading people, and I'd never seen anyone whose eyes conveyed that level of sincerity.
 My voice caught, and it took a couple of tries to get actual words out.
 "She'll come after me."
 Brandon shook his head.
 "I won't let her.
 That's part of why I wanted to talk to you.
 I won't let anyone do anything to you.
 Think of it as repayment."

Most of my jeans had been torn away from my right calf, which was bleeding fairly profusely, but I didn't feel any pain.
 It was like my mind had finally torn loose from the moorings that usually held it in contact with reality.
 I was going to die, ripped to shreds by the same impossible animals that had killed the hikers a few months ago, but I just couldn't bring myself to care.
 Nobody would even miss me.
 The black wolf was inching towards me now, growling low in its throat.
 I could see its haunches tense up, and then it was airborne, hurtling towards me almost faster than I could follow.
 Only it didn't hit me.
 A patch of night had interposed itself between me and the wolf.
 My vision still wasn't up to making out fine details, and everything was moving too quickly to follow.
 The growling seemed to be in three parts now, which didn't make any sense because the patch of night was vaguely man-shaped, if impossibly big.

Whoever this is, he is someone else.
 Someone stronger.”
 He pointed into the darkness.
 “There,” he said.
 “He returns.”
 Robed in black, the figure approached unseen by the guards.
 He lifted his hands, which shone a pallid white in the fading moonlight.
 So very slowly their color faded, from white, to gray, to nothing, a darkness surrounding and hiding them.
 “What’s going on?” Harruq asked.
 He pulled one of his swords out from its sheath, pleased by the feeling of confidence it gave him.

But she was confused--he knew that.
 And he knew that she was a virgin.
 He'd felt her initial hesitation when he'd tried to coax her lips apart, felt the shock go through her body when his tongue had touched hers.
 The fact that she'd found the kiss exciting didn't change the fact that she was an innocent.
 Or that she was far from home.
 Or that she was engaged to another man.
 He had no qualms about wooing her away from her fiancé, but how could she be anything but confused when she couldn't even talk to the man?
 Heavy-hearted, he finally got to his feet.
 He could no longer hear her sobs, but he knew he needed to give her some time alone.
 He wanted to give her a gift of apology, some flowers or something.

What I didn’t expect was their response.
 The throne room was full.
 And not one of them did not gasp when comprehension hit.
 But my father, and each of those present, seemed… pleased when they saw me.
 They had no idea there was a… human… growing in the belly my hands now cradled.
 I listened as their voices began, and then rose, clamorously discussing the news and what it could bring.
 I cringed as their words turned to the possibilities, the power I might pass down, the strength the new one might bring.
 “We will leave at daybreak,” Grey informed Ruby as I read.
 Perfect.
 The news brought on nothing but worry, so I went back to the book.

Skilled, close up fighting was all about leverage.
 Instead of resisting the attacker’s strength Rodregas pushed down on the earth with his hands and lifted his body up and to the side, curling the leg he had kicked out underneath.
 He planted his foot under his body.
 His attackers seemed confused, grabbing him and trying to counter his change of position.
 Rodregas only had one leg under him, but he pushed off with it with all his strength and thrust himself up.
 It should have failed with all the men holding him down, but he now had celestial strength, and even with the knife wound he was strong.
 His attackers backed off, confused by the fact that he had gone from being their prisoner to suddenly rising.
 The person pinning Rodregas’ left arm got too far away.
 This gave Rodregas the leverage he needed to pull the arm free.
 He punched his assailant hard in the face.

But some know.
 Some still pass it by and cross themselves, hearken back to the days of divination, the days when music could save a dying nation, a nation bent on its own self-immolation.
 That was the sixties.
 Even in Memphis, an outpost planet.
 A tributary, if you will.
 That first session, so it is told, was as if energy itself had been created in that concrete empty shell, where grass pushed through the floor, straining to catch these new vibes, this new electrical Jubal.
 Buddy cut loose as if he had been formerly playing in a straightjacket.
 And Skippy and Crafty—later re-christened Castor and Pollux—created a bottom like a sheol torture chamber, like Thor and Loki at war.
 The crash and thunder coming out of that old Sinclair station was music from the beginning of time, the music the apes heard which made them men.

“Fine, fine, I will,” he said.
 “You will impress him, Harruq, do not worry about that.”
 Qurrah left his brother to rest.

 “Grab my wrist,” Qurrah said as the dark cloud arrived that night.
 Harruq did so, and together they stepped inside.
 He felt an unseen hand grab his chest, and then they were running blind.
 The minutes crawled, their frantic breathing the only audible sound.
 Qurrah lagged further and further behind, unable to keep the pace.

Each corporation could undertake a detailed study of available technologies in its field and offer to assist corporate customers in developing countries in selecting the most appropriate technology to meet their needs.
 The corporations could also acquire the rights to important technologies with large-scale applications and then market them widely.
 Velocity of social forces
 Speed is a powerful engine for development and an important index of organizational efficiency and effectiveness.
 The higher the level of organization and development, the faster everything moves.
 The more developed the society, the faster it communicates new ideas and new information, develops new technologies and products, establishes new systems and institutions, adopts new policies and laws, transports goods, delivers services and carries out activities.
 Money, information, education, technology, public opinion, training, administrative decisions, transport, and communication are powerful social forces and resources.
 Their productivity can be increased by increasing the speed with which they are employed, in the same way that land productivity can be raised by increasing cultivation from one to two cropping seasons per year.
 In the most industrially advanced nations, the velocity of money is roughly 2.5 to 3 times higher than in the average developing country.
 Removing administrative red tape and inefficiencies in the banking system can multiply the use value and productivity of real money, because the same money can be utilized for more transactions.

I drive a lot, across the desert to visit my kids and grandson in Tucson, and all over the West and sometimes farther on vacations and book promotion tours.
 One reason I drive rather than fly is, I come closest to adoring God while on the road.
 Between cities, I plug in my I-pod.
 What goes in comes out.
 If I listen to a love song, these days I’ll probably wish for a loving companion.
 If I turn on a radio talk show, I usually want to argue.
 Those pastimes aren’t good for me.
 So, on long trips in my old Toyota I listen to hymns, gospel music and such.
 As I set off on this trip, half book promotion tour and half vacation, I’m wrestling with Brother Lawrence and the question, why don’t I adore God?
 I plan to drive up the West Coast, San Diego to Seattle, and stop over with Cliff Torrey in Atascadero and Bob Williams in Portland.

Pick up the phone at any table, dial the two digit number of the table you wanted to connect with and there you have it: a coward’s way of asking a lady to dance or talk without getting shot down tableside.
 What can I say?
 This was the style at the time.
 I was sitting at the bar with Bill, just a twenty-two year old kid, when a vision walked in.
 She stopped just a few steps inside the door.
 She wore purple high waist pants and a cream colored blouse that went all the way to her neckline with ruffled edges framing her stunning face.
 Her long blond hair flowed down to her shoulders.
 If I could put a caption over her head, it would have read, “If you talk to me, I will kill you.” She looked completely out of place, and her blue eyes lit up the room.
 Her silent stare suggested that she was not there to be picked up or even approached.
 She was not the typical girl entering an 80’s bar and dance club.

I tried to grab a hold of his arm, but he'd already taken several steps away.
 The pleasant tingly feeling was gone, but that loss was nothing against the sense of cold abandonment rushing through me.
 I tried to step forward, tried to follow him, but my vision was dimming and my heart felt like it was about to explode.
 I managed a single step before my knees collapsed and the ground jumped up to meet me.
 Consciousness was slow returning.
 When my eyes finally fluttered open, I was surprised to find myself in Alec's arms once again.
 "Are you okay?"
 He tried to set me down, to stand me up on my feet, but I grabbed onto him as tightly as my shaking arms were able.
 "Don't leave me.
 Please don't make me go."

As you gain control over your magical powers you will only become more dangerous.
 The question is whether you want to fight?” Imeralda nodded and she hesitated.
 “I will be honest,” she said.
 “I am a little torn, I have never been as afraid as during and after the battle.
 I have truly come to care for both of you.
 I have met few men of such character and willingness to take on the Guild of the Celestial Path and all their power.” She continued, “I want to be with you.
 I want to share this journey, but I am not a warrior.
 And the two of you were so close to dying on me, and next time I might not be able to save you and you might die…,” she paused.
 “I could handle dying, but I am not sure I could handle having you die in my arms.” “Imeralda,” said Doi’van, “we must all walk our own paths.

He pulled her into his arms, hugging her tightly.
 "I don't want to cause you pain.
 But I can't help it that I love you.
 And that I want you to stay here with me."
 Her body shook with sobs.
 Rick scooped her up and sat down with her on his lap.
 "Please don't cry, sweetheart," he pleaded, kissing her hair.
 He opened his mouth to tell her that she might not even be able to get back, since she'd been unsuccessful so far.
 But that would just hurt her more.
 Still, the thought calmed his own turbulent feelings.

This one proved a surprise.
 The normal scent I'd come to associate with roses was there, with the slightest hint of something new, something better than anything I'd ever been exposed to.
 I leaned in even closer in an attempt to drink in the fragrance, and heard the rustle of expensive paper as I brushed the note that had been attached to the rose with a simple green ribbon.
 My name was elegantly scrawled along the outside face in a script I'd only seen one other place.
 After a moment's hesitation, I unfolded the parchment.
 Your birthday should be a time of happiness.
 I've spent months looking for a name for this flower, and at the point of giving up, inspiration struck today.
 Lagrimas del Angel always come at too high a cost.
 Nothing so exquisite could be otherwise.

She looked up and nodded to me.
 I turned back around to see Kojas slash Seth across the stomach.
 That’s when I screamed.
 Seth fell to his knees, holding his midsection.
 His sword fell out of his grip and to the ground.
 Kojas grinned in triumph and kicked Seth to the ground.
 I screamed again, when he didn’t move.
 “At last,” Kojas breathed.
 “Monster!” I cried.
 “You’re a monster!” He didn’t answer me.

Isaac recovered with admirable speed, smiling as he gestured us forward.
 "Well, then, after you."
 It wasn't until Rachel and Isaac were driving away that I realized she'd completely pulled me out of my funk.
 I still didn't know that I could really depend on her, but at least I knew she'd try her hardest.
 Chapter 17 I reached out groggily to turn off my alarm, and then wished it was still the weekend so I wouldn't have to get up and go to school.
 I finished off my normal morning routine with a pair of aspirin from the bathroom cupboard.
 I didn't usually like taking drugs of any kind, but I had a sharp headache building already.
 I shuffled downstairs, waved a speechless hello to Mom, grabbed my lunch, bag, and books as I absently wondered why there was a cupcake on the counter with a lit candle.
 Mom has always been paranoid about open flames.
 She'd nearly burned down the house as a kid.

“She does have a way with potions and such.” “I enjoy the mixing,” Ruby said, startling me again as she entered the house.
 “But not to worry, I keep it contained to elements and minerals, no breeding.
 I leave that to Steed.” She laughed at her own words as she passed us on the way to her room.
 I found myself reevaluating her now that I knew she was Steed’s sister.
 Chevelle noticed me watching her.
 “Do you mind staying with Ru—” My expression cut him off.
 “I have some business to take care of outside of town.
 She has given me her word she will behave.” He eyed her as he spoke, a warning.
 She replied from the open door of her room, “Yes, yes.
 No naughtiness.” And then, under her breath, “On my part.” “No qualifications, Ruby.” “Just teasing.

In deference to my new dedication to academic excellence, I finished up the reading, and then opened up my Biology book and started trying to get a handle on all of the items I'd thought I understood, but apparently hadn't.
 When the bell rang I limped back to my locker before making my painful way to Physics.
 I almost turned around and left when I saw the substitute again, but almost two decades of ingrained respect for authority figures propelled me into the room and to my seat.
 I happened to look up at the exact moment that Alec appeared in the doorway.
 I expected him to take one look at the sub and turn around like he'd done before, but he registered the presence of a substitute and then came inside regardless.
 It didn't make sense until the first girl all but fainted as he walked past her desk.
 Of course.
 He didn't like substitutes, and figured he had better places to be, but the draw of hero worship after having almost double-teamed Vincent was just too much to resist.
 The sub took a desultory roll, and then waved his hands at us.

"Good."
 He stroked her cheek with one finger.
 "That's all I want."
 Her heart began pounding when she realized he was going to kiss her goodnight.
 His lips were light, almost teasing, as they touched hers.
 When he raised his head, she couldn't look away from him.
 Rick smiled at her somewhat dazed expression.
 "Sleep well, sweetheart."
 "Goodnight, Rick."
 She gave him a quick smile before slipping into her room.

He kept remembering the mother with her young babe clutched to her breast as she fled from him.
 When he had rammed her, she had tucked the child to guard it from the fall.
 Right before the kill, she had held him, trying to protect him.
 “Why?” he asked.
 A part of him worried he might wake his brother, but he was too drained to care.
 “Why did she do that?
 She could have run faster without the child!”
 No, he knew that answer.
 She would not abandon her child just as he would not abandon Qurrah.
 Then what was bothering him so?

Everybody who looked at home, we imagined had flopped in the Beat boarding houses Kerouac immortalized, or at least listened to the man speak his words in the Cellar, accompanied by a jazz riffing tenor sax.
 We overdosed on espresso.
 Then, as we climbed a hill to recover, I recited a jumble of lines I remembered from Ginsberg's Howl: "I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix, wandered around and around at midnight in the railway yard wondering where to go, and loned it through the streets of Idaho seeking visionary Indian angels, and lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup, a hopeless task, and so took ship and disappeared into the volcanoes of Mexico leaving nothing behind but the shadow of dungarees and the larva and ash of poetry..." And I recited from On the Road about the children crying in Iowa where they let the children cry and where "the evening star must be drooping and spreading her sparkler dims on the prairie, which is just before the coming of complete night that blesses the earth, darkens the all rivers, cups the peaks and folds the final shore in."
 We explored every street and alley of North Beach and drifted into Chinatown, where I imagined us meeting two exquisite immigrant girls.
 I told Eric these beauties would plead for us to steal them away from the rich devil who had enslaved and brought them from China.
 We would conspire to snatch a suitcase full of cash from the rich devil.
 Then we would speed off toward the forests of Idaho to live in dissolute passion for a while.
 As always when my mind spilled over, Eric stood by me, often wearing a smile that hinted of love.
 Back in North Beach after midnight, a couple of Finochio’s transvestite dancers waylaid us.
 The four of us loitered under streetlamps listening to their pitch about the glories of San Francisco.

Rodregas looked into Imeralda’s eyes.
 She had been watching him.
 There was no need for words, no argument.
 The decision was made, they only need direction.
 Any hope for success laid in playing to their strength.
 Rodregas said, ”Doi’van, you stay here and use the bow.
 You start from the middle of the caravan as soon as you feel comfortable, and focus on the slavers.
 If you get a free shot at an Immortal Guard, take it, but we need to reduce the numbers against us.” “Imeralda, you need to stay away from the close-in fighting.
 Get as far back as you can and still be able to see and shoot into the road.
 You will focus on the front of the caravan and also focus on the regular slavers.

Maybe he'd go back to normal after a few days.
 There really wasn't any way to know though.
 I didn't even know what'd brought on the sudden change.
 Was he really just angry I'd overheard Jasmin threaten Lucy?
 Why did I even care?
 Spanish dragged by at a snail's pace, but somehow before I knew it, I was walking with Britney towards the tutor lab.
 I should have been surprised when we rounded a corner to find Brandon casually leaning against the wall, obviously waiting for us, for me.
 "You still okay to go home with Brit today?"
 He acted like it was all my choice.
 It gave me goose bumps.

Dominic's gentle smile wasn't quite as enthusiastic, but I already knew her subdued reaction wasn't any less heartfelt.
 Throw in Jasmin's congratulations, which seemed to indicate the passing grade had been nothing less than inevitable, with Alec taking my hand as soon as I sat down, and Jessica and James' lack of response didn't matter at all.
 With Isaac's reassuring presence at my side in History, I weathered the renewed gossip, apparently occasioned by the entire pack's absence during lunch for the second day in a row, and soon found myself reunited with Alec in Physics.
 As luck would have it, Mrs. Alexander was gone again, and the substitute was typically clueless about what we were supposed to be doing.
 Alec of course spent the whole class unearthing other little bits of embarrassing information.
 I'd never experienced anything like it, every question I answered spawned two more, and he invariably seemed to figure out the underlying reasons I'd done a given thing, or reacted a certain way.
 I'd just finished describing my failed tryout for the school's production of To Kill a Mockingbird, when he hit me with a completely unexpected question.
 "So tell me about both your best date and your worst date before you came here."
 I felt my skin instantly heat up, and looked down, unable to meet his gaze.
 He let me sit there for a couple of seconds, and then reached out and used one gentle finger to nudge my chin up.

 Art – We’ve covered that.
 Jim – Did your dad ever cover what to do in such a situation?
 Art – No he didn’t, most of his advice so far has been geared to identifying women who might give you a chance.
 Jim – No tips on what to do when you have her?
 Art – Nope.
 Dad only ever dated one girl, and he ended up marrying her.
 Jim – What the hell kind of expert on women does that make him then?
 Art – One with a narrow range of study, limited to one subject.
 But it’s better than what you have.

 We could hear him approaching the bedroom as the volume of his voice increased.
 We watched through the slats in the closet door as he would open her dresser drawers and rummage through her belongings, including her undergarments, while looking around over his shoulder, still yelling her name.
 Eventually, he would leave and somehow mom would come up with the rent to keep a roof over our heads for another month.
 We were getting old enough to know that we were different than most families in many ways, but we always knew we had a loving mother.

"This really is messy."
 Rick grabbed her wrist when she started to reach for a napkin.
 He leaned forward, taking her forefinger into his mouth and licking off the sweet and sour sauce.
 Heat flooded Marie's body.
 She watched, helpless, as Rick continued to suck on her finger, his tongue caressing it.
 He raised his eyes to hers as he freed her finger.
 "Better?"
 She felt paralyzed.
 How could his sucking her finger make her feel the same way his kisses did?
 She caught her breath when he raised her hand again to lick the sauce from her thumb.

Two hikers were killed by some kind of wild animal a few months ago."
 I felt my heart skip a beat as a chill ran from the base of my spine all the way to my scalp.
 Britney's innocuous words shouldn't have caused my mind to immediately sink back to the terror I'd felt this morning, but they did.
 For a moment I couldn't focus on what Britney was saying, my heartbeat had become completely erratic from the surge of adrenaline flooding my body as it futilely tried to escape the nameless things that'd been snapping at my heels.
 "...out in the south end of Zions.
 It was Mark Childs and Lessi Arnolds.
 The bodies were a couple of days old by the time search and rescue found them, but it was pretty obvious they'd been mauled by something."
 I opened my mouth to interrupt, but my vocal chords weren't working.
 Now that she'd finally broached the subject, Britney was unstoppable.
 "It had to have been a mountain lion, there isn't anything else around here that's both aggressive and big enough to kill people, but neither of them had been gnawed on at all, which was strange enough by itself.

You have elven blood in you as well.
 I wouldn’t be surprised if you lasted a couple hundred years yourself.
 This is assuming someone doesn’t kill you, which I find rather unlikely.”
 Harruq gasped at the thought.
 He had always felt akin to man and orcs, whose lives burnt out so quickly.
 The idea of living two hundred years was…‌well, more than he could handle.
 “Strange,” he said.
 “Guess I have plenty of time to learn to read, don’t I?”
 Aurelia laughed.
 “You do, but I would prefer we not take too many years.

Qurrah returned home, his eyes sagging and his mind exhausted.
 When he climbed into bed, he fell asleep instantly.
 Not long after, Harruq rose, took his swords, and left for his own meeting.

 “You’re late,” Aurelia said, stepping out from behind a tree.
 Harruq shrugged and held out two branches he had whittled into crude imitations of swords.
 “Had to make something for me to spar you with,” he said.
 “Those sticks are unnecessary,” Aurelia said as she took up her staff, the tiniest hint of a smile curling on her lips.
 “Draw your swords.”

Alec was staring at me, an expression of disapproval marring otherwise perfect features.
 "Of all the places for you to intrude, why did it have to be here?"
 For a second, surrounded as I was by such beauty, I did feel like an intruder.
 He was gorgeous, and his tan skin seemed to have the slightest hint of light playing beneath its surface.
 I was as plain and ugly as always.
 My response popped out before I could think about it.
 "Only you could see such beauty and think only of keeping it to yourself.
 Trust me, even with surroundings like this I'd much rather be elsewhere if you're part of the bargain."
 The thought of being elsewhere brought our newest crisis to mind, and I realized that it was very likely I wouldn't have to worry about Britney, Alec, or Brandon for very much longer.
 "At least you won't have to suffer my presence for much longer; we'll be gone all too quickly."

So he bought her one with the works, along with onion rings and a Sprite.
 She'd never had either of those two, and she sighed and rolled her eyes as if she were feasting on ambrosia.
 Since she'd had Coke but never heard of Sprite, he assumed that Sprite hadn't been invented by 1927, but he wondered if maybe the fact that she'd never had onion rings was due to her social class.
 Times had definitely changed where food was concerned.
 You had to be extremely wealthy and travel in very exclusive circles if you'd never had onion rings or-- "Pizza!"
 she exclaimed when she saw a girl walk by with a slice.
 "I've seen the commercials on television.
 Is it really good?"
 "Fantastic.

There probably wasn't anyone in the school who knew less about fighting than me.
 I knew I should turn around and run away before Cassie realized I was serious, but somehow I didn't care.
 Cassie's arsenal of nasty tricks wouldn't be so effective against someone who'd already been kicked out of their house and moved to another state.
 All I really needed to do was survive the next few minutes.
 I'd be out of the state before she really got busy making my life miserable.
 A dozen different things I could say blew through my mind, but they were all competing, and none of them fit the situation.
 In typical fashion, I found myself without anything clever to say.
 Instead I just stood there and stared at Cassie.
 I'd thought things were tense already, but where everyone had been quiet before, now they were motionless too.
 Cassie spun around and glared at me.

"Treadmill?
 Exercise tape?"
 "You'll see."
 That night he showed her how to use the treadmill and how to work the VCR.
 He rented an exercise video and the two movies he'd mentioned, and Marie found herself looking forward to the next day.
 She was up at the crack of dawn, and after she got dressed, she was tempted to go walk on the treadmill before she woke Rick.
 Walking but never moving was an interesting experience.
 But the fog might not last long, and she had to get back today.
 But this time she didn't go charging headlong through the garden.
 She'd gotten here by strolling through it thinking about Davis.

Tony said, “Oh.
 Good.” A week later, he was leading a Bible study at our house.
 Cliff’s not much of a talker.
 I believe nobody heard his stories from Vietnam until years afterward.
 I don’t pry, so I can’t be sure what goes on inside him, but I have no reason to think he believes in God, or that he doesn’t.
 But whether he believes or not, Cliff has gotten well blessed since our evening with Billy Graham.
 He has four wonderful kids, and Toni, who is one of those rarest of people who appear to grow brighter, stronger, and more beautiful every year.
 Cliff and Billy's dad, Cliff Senior, invited me to dinner not many years ago.
 The evening became an in vino veritas experience.
 After some cups, he said, “Ken, you should know it was me that hounded my son into serving in Vietnam.” I held back from saying, Yeah, I know.

I wish I could come right out and say it while you're awake.
 I don't want that life anymore.
 I don't really want any life that doesn't involve you."
 Part of me wanted to scream for joy, to jump up out of my bed and wrap myself around Alec as tightly as I could, but I was just too far gone.
 I half thought I was dreaming it all.
 As I finally let sleep pull me down into darkness, I almost thought I heard Alec say one last thing.
 The tone was so vulnerable and hesitant he almost sounded like another person.
 "The truth is, I've fallen well and truly in love with you."
 Chapter 23 Someone was calling my name, but I really didn't want to wake up.
 I was still so tired, and I'd had the most wonderful dreams.

The sun was now streaming into the room and he was feeling the lack of sleep.
 He decided that it would take a while for the keep to empty out as everyone went into town to ‘celebrate’ Ravenhurr’s new birthday, and he stretched out on the big four-poster bed.
 He had thought that he would struggle to sleep, but instead immediately found deep sleep.
 In what felt like only a few minutes later, he struggled from deep within his dreams to the sound of a polite knock on the door.
 He looked around for a second, confused by his surroundings until memories returned.
 The sunlight through the windows was now indirect so he guessed it to be mid or even late afternoon.
 Again came the polite knock; no one would dare such persistence without direct orders from Ravenhurr.
 It had to be Adapt Korin.
 He nearly leaped off the bed and looked for a sword but of course there was none.
 He stepped in front of the bedroom door as he quickly did his best to close the broken study door.

Somehow I made it to the library without tripping or looking back, though I was nearly overcome with the temptation to turn at the door to see him one more time.
 The library steps curled around the interior of the tree, shelves cut into every space above and below, tables and racks and patrons scattered about the remaining areas.
 I found a dark, empty corner on the third level and relaxed onto a seat, leaning against the inside wall of the old tree and taking in the scent of ancient paper and binding.
 After a momentary pause to blot out the latest incident of poor self-control, I decided to attempt to locate the missing pages by magic.
 I had, after all, succeeded in growing only days ago.
 I concentrated as hard as I could and, though nothing flitted out of the shelves and onto my desk, I had a strong feeling I knew where the documents were.
 It also could have been that I knew where they had fallen from the day before.
 Regardless, I made my way over and took a few volumes and scrolls back to my secluded table.
 I was able to find several documents on the northern clans and even one of the missing pages of names—L.
 I had spread them out on the table and was studiously examining them when a shadow crossed my desk.

Still, Dominic had been right so many days ago.
 Alec was worth it, and as long as he still loved me, I was going to do my best to help him see that we belonged together.
 Human or shape shifter, homely or gorgeous, none of that mattered.
 All that mattered was he made my heart beat faster, and I could no longer imagine my life without him.
 I guess you call that love.

Ten years ago ICPF called for the democratization of the United Nations by abolition of the veto power in the Security Council, induction of new members to make that body more representative, and establishment of democratically-elected representative government as an essential condition for membership or active participation in the UN system.
 The nexus between democracy and prosperity is undeniable.
 The democratic revolution that has so effectively penetrated Eastern Europe in recent years and extended its roots in other regions must be taken to its logical conclusion at the level of nations and at the level of international institutions.
 World Peace Army: The most far-sighted of ICPF’s proposals sought to evolve a practical mechanism to promote the objectives of cooperative security and democratic freedom.
 It called for the establishment of a World Peace Army, to be constituted by and open to all democratic countries willing to renounce the right to aggression against other nations and willing to contribute personnel and resources to an international multilateral military force capable of defending its members from external threats.
 Such a mechanism, so long as it is inclusive, would provide a real and viable alternative to national militarization, whether or not it was constituted by or within the UN system.
 The success of NATO in maintaining peaceful relations among the democratic states of Western Europe and North America for more than half a century is a viable model which is limited primarily by the exclusivity of its membership.
 The recent measures taken by the European Union to constitute a European Army are evidence of the practicality of establishing a similar mechanism open to all nations.
 The unfortunate situation now witnessed in Iraq could have been avoided, if ICPF’s plea for a World Peace Army had been heeded.
 Eradicating the Roots of Terrorism: Terrorism is not new to the world, but with the withdrawal of national rivalries between East and West, violence by non-nation states has increased in intensity and is viewed as a far greater security concern by the entire world.

I often backed myself into a corner and curled there like a fetus, as if covering my balls and stomach were protection, as if I feared some attack of a physical nature.
 This is what the fear does to you.
 It’s totally debilitating, man.
 Nausea can unseat you, can defeat the strongest man.
 And it’s a nausea that is in your blood—your whole body is sick.
 And, you know, looking at it now, I think I was sick like the country was sick.
 I was nauseated for the USA, you dig?
 I took those deaths, that ignominious war, the whole queasy zeitgeist of the times and internalized them.
 And I couldn’t get away, not in a cabin, not in my music, not anywhere, man, because the enemy was me.
 And, dad, anyone who’s ever had that kind of stomach failure, where you feel like your whole system is shutting down on you, knows how bone-deep that kind of pain and fear is.

Rodregas stood up.
 He felt strength and other things he was not sure how to describe.
 He looked around the room and the dim light now seemed far brighter.
 He started walking over toward where he had left Doi’van, and this time he got to see the result of taking on a greater sigil as the dragon reared up.
 All three heads roared and the wings started to beat and the dragon seemed to actually fly for a second.
 For just a brief moment there were two daemon dragons.
 Then one of them fell toward the ground only to sink into the shape of Doi’van.
 Doi’van staggered and Rodregas reached out and caught him to keep him from falling.
 Apparently, being a three headed daemon dragon did not include a cat-like ability to land from a fall.
 Rodregas steadied him and then Doi’van shook himself and looked around, confused.

Do not break formation!” A shout came from the elven side, and then the hail began.
 More than a hundred arrows rained down on the army, each deathly precise in its aim.
 Not one hit flesh.
 Antonil lowered his shield.
 Something was wrong.
 He did not hear the screams of pain, the thudding of arrows onto shields, and the angry cries that should have followed.
 Instead, he heard a stunned silence.
 As his shield lowered, his eyes took in a shocking sight.
 A black wall encircled them, translucent at times, but flaring when an arrow struck it.
 The projectiles snapped and broke as if hitting stone.

The pain had diminished his skills.
 They were atop him, but he dared not move.
 He sent a silent prayer to Celestia as more footfalls clomped all around him.
 He guessed at least ten.
 Soft clacking sounds of bone, swinging metal, and crushed grass erased the silence of the night.
 Dieredon’s heart resumed.
 His breathing continued, slow and steady.
 He fought down a laugh, despite all his training.
 As dire as his situation seemed, he could honestly say he had been in worse shape before and survived.
 Three times, even.

Donovan smiled as Dom reached us.
 "I'll leave her in your care then, Mistress Sanchez?"
 Alec watched Donovan leave, and then turned back to the pack and chivvied them back into motion.
 I grabbed onto Dom's hand with enough force to bruise a normal person as Isaac and James turned on each other with a sudden ferocity that left me breathless.
 "It's okay.
 They're training, sparring if you will."
 It was hard to believe what I was watching was anything less than an all-out bid to kill each other.
 Isaac ducked a vicious swipe from James, and then knocked the smaller hybrid over with a backhand blow I was pretty sure would've crushed rock.
 Dominic winced a little as the blow landed and her boyfriend hit with earth-shattering force.

 Flying overhead, Dieredon watched the beginning of the battle with a sickness in his stomach.
 The man in black had come.
 He watched the arrows bounce off the magical shield, and then watched the human army charge and overwhelm the small elven force that had come to face them.
 “I will keep my word, Antonil,” he said.
 “Fly back to the others, Sonowin, we will battle this day.” The horse snorted, making Dieredon laugh.
 “No, I am sure you won’t be hurt.” Sonowin banked, giving the elf one last view of the battle before soaring east to where the rest of the Quellan elves waited atop their magnificent pegasi.
 His horse neighed a quick question, one Dieredon wished he could laugh at.
 “Everyone can be killed,” he said, tying his hair behind his head.

Fiery one, her.” I wrapped my arms around my legs, holding my knees tight, and placed my chin there to rest my head.
 “Tell me more.” It was all I could do to pay attention to his words, but I was fascinated by their sound.
 “Her father was a dark elf.
 When her mother died during childbirth, he left her here in the village.
 I suppose it was for the best, really, since she can’t fly.
 The fairies would have tormented her.
 She’s still a bit of an outcast though.” He was still talking as I struggled to catch up in my head.
 I interrupted him, unable to stop myself.
 “My mother died.” I had no idea why I was speaking.
 I batted my eyes and tried to shake it off, concentrating on Steed again.

Joe Ben is the book’s endearing and admirable character, a humble Christian of supreme courage.
 A vision, I believe, of what Cassady could have become had he overcome his demons.
 So, I sit on my porch and dream myself back to the morning when Cliff and I woke up in a Tijuana riverbed.
 Instead of what happened, I tell Cliff I’m going on the road to find Kerouac.
 Then I drive Route 66 and the turnpike from Chicago, 3000 miles to the Left Bank Bar in Lindenhurst, Long Island, where Bobby Casso introduces Jack and me.

 His eyes open wider.
 Still in my dream, I'm back home when a postcard arrives, from Jack, who writes that he’s gone and found his daughter, Jan, who would otherwise also die young, and they’re going to live in peace, joy, and love, now and for eternity.
 And they might help save Neal Cassady.

Van’dret’s senses were acute on things arcane and he felt the coming flood of power as if it was a real physical thing.
 Van’dret spread his hands and made a frantic move that sent a corona of power around him.
 Of course no focused magic came near him, and what did occur startled even Rodregas.
 Imeralda was literally flying through the air and she had her dagger drawn.
 She did not land smoothly, colliding into Van’dret’s lower body, but she instantly straightened and thrust her dagger into Van’dret’s stomach.
 The dagger did not sink far; a few inches.
 Rodregas expected Van’dret to get his hands up and fend her off, but he seemed to be in shock.
 Imeralda pulled the dagger out and then viscously stuck it back in the sorcerer, her body moved with the stroke, clearly using every ounce of strength she had.
 Still the blade only stuck in a few inches, but Van’dret screamed and fell to the floor and started to drag himself away.
 As soon as the surprisingly high pitch of Van’dret scream sounded, both Doi’van’s and Rodregas’ feet were free.

Seth dropped his hand and pushed past me.
 “Stop yelling my name, Jazell, or you’ll tell the whole world that I’m here.” My arm dropped and I slid the knife back in its sheath.
 I followed Seth through the trees.
 This time there were less of them and the only ones that around us looked half dead.
 The bark was peeling off and I could see the tree branches leaning towards the ground.
 The air was cold and heavy, like a mound of snow on your shoulders.
 The trees parted to show a cliff.
 We walked up to the edge and the wind whipped at my face.
 A feeling of déjà vu came upon me.
 I knew where we were because I had been here before.

We were out of red at the time.
 Jim – Perhaps that is why you’re attempt at using dark magic failed.
 However I doubt that voodoo curses would solve our problems anyhow.
 Liz – Red food coloring would have been a little better, but not much.
 Jim – You could have at least used Tabasco sauce or something, we always have that.
 Johnny – I didn’t think it would matter what I put in if I didn’t have the Dodo blood.
 Liz – Good point.
 Jim – Guess we can discount using dark magic or voodoo to solve the problem of Gene’s father.
 Johnny – What do you suggest then?
 Jim – I dunno, just wait I guess.

I normally would've been mad, or possibly embarrassed, but it was like my feelings were wrapped in layers of cotton candy.
 If I really pushed, I could faintly feel the hard edges, but there were so many layers shrouding them.
 I just couldn't seem to muster up enough concentration to care.
 I was on autopilot now.
 I answered Britney's whispered questions without ever registering them and never once worried about whether or not I'd made sense.
 I parried Mrs. Campbell's concerned inquiries in much the same manner, probably not convincing her that I was okay, but at least persuading her to leave me alone, and then sleep-walked into the cafeteria.
 I hated the fact that I wanted Brandon to come sit down with me.
 If he did a convincing enough job pretending to like me and I tried really hard, maybe I'd believe it'd all just been my imagination.
 It'd be one less piece of my world crumbling out from under me.
 Britney slammed her tray down, but my listless gaze didn't move from the vacant corner where Brandon usually sat.

You aren't going to fall asleep if the light is on and you're staring at me."
 "Fine, the light can be off, but I get to ask you questions still, and you need to start giving me real answers."
 The chuckle was a little more resigned, but he didn't argue, so I launched into my first question before I'd really thought it through.
 "What...I mean, you're all so different..." I trailed off into silence worried he was going to be mad.
 "I think you meant to ask what I am."
 Alec sighed, but it wasn't an angry sigh, so I nodded, forgetting for a moment that he couldn't see me in the darkness.
 "We share a little in common with a bunch of different legends, but none get it quite right.
 In short, we're shape shifters, people who can take the form of animals."
 I'd already seen that for myself, but it was strangely exhilarating to hear him admit it.
 "You mean like werewolves?"

Traffic was terrible the next morning, but he managed to find the gate he'd been told to go to.
 The attendant had his name on a list and gave him directions to stage three.
 "Why did your name have to be on a list?"
 Marie asked him.
 "That's the only way to get in."
 "How did you get your name on the list?"
 "I-I called.
 Here--I think this is it."
 He hurried her inside the building and asked the first person he saw for Eric Waite.
 Fortunately, the man was only a few yards away, talking to a cameraman.

I shrugged uncomfortably.
 "I guess maybe it shouldn't, but it does.
 Nobody likes to be ridiculed, but it's even more than that.
 The attacks started up a couple of months ago.
 They...remind me of a really terrible thing that happened, so when people make a big deal out of them it's like it's all happening again."
 Rachel nodded slowly, her wonderfully expressive face full of sympathy.
 "I'm sorry to have pried like that.
 If I'd known it would make you feel bad, I wouldn't have asked."
 I tried to shrug indifferently, but she seemed to see through my pretenses.
 "I normally wouldn't have said anything, but knowing what I know now, I wouldn't want you to go through the next several days hurting inside because you think everyone looking at you out of the corner of their eye is ridiculing you."

“Oh.” I contemplated his answer.
 “I thought maybe you had a knife.” He smirked.
 “Yes, well, that would have been easy enough.” “And Junnie prefers to hunt… for sport?” He had that look again and I wondered why he would be so cautious.
 Because I was dangerous?
 A practitioner of dark magic?
 “No.
 Some prefer the meat not to be tainted by magic.
 They feel it is more… pure.” He pronounced ‘tainted’ with an edge.
 “Is it?
 Tainted I, mean?” “I have lived on it for—” His words caught midsentence and he said, “Well, it doesn’t seem to be, but to each his own.” He turned back to the fire.

I wanted to say something witty, but the thoughts all just swirled around in my head without making it down to my mouth.
 Brandon's smile grew just a little bigger.
 "I really think you should let me give you a ride home.
 Based on our past history, it's only a matter of time before one of us runs into the other, and I'm afraid of what my Mustang might do to you when that happens."
 Brandon's voice washed over me like silk, carrying away any desires I might have had to walk all the way home just to prove a point.
 Not trusting my voice, I nodded and took the couple of steps needed to reach his passenger door.
 "I wanted to apologize for what happened earlier today.
 Cassie can be a real jerk sometimes."
 It was too good to be true.
 I almost looked over at him, but I knew I'd lose myself in a pair of soft, gray eyes.

With the memory came concern for Doi’van and Imeralda, and a surge of adrenaline that gave him the energy to try to wake up.
 Rodregas tried to sit up, but his body, which had been so strong since that day at Raven Keep, now only responded sluggishly.
 He was sleepy, but had the idea that he had been sleeping a very long time.
 Yet, his body still felt exhausted.
 Rodregas must have moved enough to get some attention because a man, or to be more accurate, an adult male Nymph, moved into his sight.
 Rodregas was always surprised by the amount of hair coming out of the ears of an adult Nymph.
 He was glad that was one trait that Imeralda did not seem to have.
 He knew the thought to be a silly one even as it crossed his mind.
 It was quickly replaced with concern.
 For a second he thought that he was tied down, but Rodregas could see enough to determine that his restraints were tightly tucked bed sheets.

Our half-brother, Harry (named after Dino’s father) was soon born.
 Then, my stepfather had even less regard for us as we were now second-class citizens to his “real” son.
 My mother was also abused.
 She stayed, as so many abused women do, because her only options would only lead us back to poverty and uncertainty, and also because Dino threatened to take my little brother to Greece where she would never see him again.
 She protected us and herself as best as she could and she likely hoped for better days.
 Back then we didn’t have options as kids either.
 There were no toll free hotline numbers to call to safely report abuse and we knew better than to tell anyone what was happening behind closed doors.
 If we kept our mouths shut we would hopefully avoid making him even angrier.
 He weighed over 200 pounds and he could do some damage any way he beat us.
 The primary goal when getting beaten by a person nearly twice one’s size is to limit injuries and not escalate the violence because there is no winning.

"I probably wouldn't have complicated things this way save for the fact that for only the third time in my long life, I've looked inside a human, and seen something outside of the ordinary there."
 "Wait, you mean me?
 I've got a power?
 I'm about as ordinary as you can get."
 "Hardly ordinary.
 Have you had more of the dreams since Alec rescued you?"
 "How can they be a power?
 They're gorgeous, but nothing cool like what you described."
 Mallory started to answer, only to break off as she was overcome with another coughing fit.
 Thankfully this one was less intense.

Love heals.
 Along with The Practice of the Presence of God and some mysteries, I have been reading about Feodor Dostoyevski's philosophical positions, because the issues he tackled a century and a half ago are still remarkably current.
 In Dostoyevski the Thinker, I discovered a passage written following the death of his first wife.
 Since I have the book with me, I pull into a turnout overlooking the Pacific, find the passage and reread it.
 "To love someone as oneself, in accordance with Christ's commandment, is impossible.
 The love of personality is binding on earth.
 The self stands in the way.
 Christ could do it, but Christ was an eternal ideal, toward which man strives and must strive, by the law of nature.
 Meanwhile, after the appearance of Christ, as the ideal of man in the flesh, it became as clear as day that the highest, the final development of personality must come to this: that the person should recognize and with the full force of his nature be convinced that the highest someone can make of his self is to annihilate this self, as it were—to give it totally to each and every one, individually and unselfishly.
 And this is the greatest happiness."

“His spirit will be bound to mine,” Qurrah said, sitting on his knees before the body.
 His eyes were closed and his hands atop Ahrqur’s head.
 “Any question you or I ask he must answer truthfully.
 Do not be disturbed by the sound he first makes.
 Spirits brought back into our world rarely enjoy the journey.”
 Harruq nodded, dressed in his black armor.
 They did not have much time before Velixar’s dark cloud arrived.
 They could not rush, but nor could they dawdle.
 Qurrah inhaled deeply and began casting his spell.
 The words of magic were similar to those when he raised the eight corpses back in Cornrows.

It wasn’t much, but it would get them started; they were lucky he was being so generous.
 Rodregas felt he owed them, and if he had been in their place he would have tried to kill Ravenhurr.
 Clearly the three human men were eager to get started back to the main road.
 He noticed that the Hellborn Doi’van and Imeralda seemed to be hanging back.
 As the three men started to head down the road Doi’van walked up to Rodregas and stated, “I would rather travel with you.” That was it; he just stood there like some huge tree after that simple statement.
 Audrian seemed as surprised as he was.
 They both spoke at the same time, their thoughts strangely in agreement.
 “Are you crazy?” asked Audrian at the same time as Rodregas said, “That is crazy.” “Look, the Guild will be after me,” Rodregas stated.
 “It will not be safe to travel in my company,” he added.
 “I know,” stated the Hellborn in a voice that was so deep it was like stones grinding.

Several cars drove slowly through the hotel parking lot, gawking.
 I stared back at them trying not to look ashamed, hoping one of my neighbors or clients didn’t drive by.
 It had to look like I was getting arrested!
 I could hear the police and undercover officers talking about me amongst themselves.
 In one exchange, a uniform officer asked an undercover officer what they busted me for and who I was turning on.
 The undercover officer told him I was the father of a kid they busted and I was “working my son’s deal.” The uniform officer responded that he had never heard of that before to which the undercover officer replied that this, as far as he knew, was a first.
 After I was wired, tested, and instructed to put my shirt and jacket back on, the briefing began.
 A loose circle of about a dozen officers stood between my truck and the van that would record the sting from the wire I was wearing.
 I would call the target soon and instruct her to meet me in a particular spot.
 Things moved rapidly now and the instructions came quickly.

My name is Art by the way, Arthur Trelain.
 Karen – Pleased to meet you Arthur.
 If you don’t mind, why do you feel that you won’t be a good tour guide?
 Art – Well aside from the most important fact that I know next to nothing about art, I also tend to ramble on in strange directions when I make speeches.
 And unless you want to here me go off about how the tiles on the floor clash with the paintings, well you may just wish for better company.
 Karen – I don’t mind the rambling, at least if you let me get a word in edgewise to stop you.
 Art – Well, I’ll try.
 Where shall we start?
 Karen – Why don’t we start with your favorite piece of Elizabeth’s?
 Art – That would be difficult, since that particular honor is taken by her rendition of Dog’s Playing Poker.

Apparently the stress of the fight had finally awakened his potential, and his power was a real humdinger.
 The metaphysical hurricane that'd knocked me to the ground had actually been Alec pulling power from all of the shape shifters and humans in the area.
 The experience had been nearly as overwhelming for Alec as it had been for the rest of us.
 He'd recovered just in time to find Brandon grimly pulling himself along on all fours.
 Luckily Alec had recovered more quickly, and once Brandon was deprived of the strength and speed his power had bestowed upon him, Alec had been more than a match for him, even wounded and exhausted.
 Brandon's end had been quick, and if Alec hadn't realized my blood was slowly leaking out onto the ground, the rest of Brandon's pack would've likewise been quickly sorted out.
 Instead, Alec had stumbled over, shifted back to human form, and got the bleeding slowed to a point where I wasn't in imminent danger of death.
 Unfortunately that'd been all the delay Brandon's pack had needed to make a run for it.
 Isaac, James and Jasmin were trying to track down the worst of the lot, the ones who'd taken an active part in Brandon's atrocities, but it was slow going.
 Part of the job had been resolved when Cassie and two other wolves had tried to circle around and attack the estate.

BG: 	I have confused recollections of my first awareness of Bob Dylan.
 I have a vague memory of hearing “Song for Woody” on FM 100, back in Memphis, which at that time was an album-oriented station, not limited to a ludicrous playlist like it is today.
 It was a source back then, a touchstone.
 You could hear music unavailable elsewhere.
 The music of the planets.
 I listened to it alone in my parent’s living room, hearing sounds that transformed me as surely as did Lorelei, the finding of my own voice.
 “Talkin World War III Blues” was beyond my ken.
 I thought, perhaps, my head would explode.
 I didn’t understand.
 In my reptile brain I have also the memory of my friend Ricky Adams’ big brother having “folk” albums, some by a handsome, young, angular-faced singer named Bob Dylan, whose songs were meant as social anthems, wrong-righters.

Mom met me at the bottom of the creaking stairs with a big smile on her tired face.
 "The view from the rooms as the sun starts to set is even better than I thought it would be.
 Coming here was the best idea we've ever had."
 Normally Mom's enthusiasm was fairly catching.
 You expect that kind of energy in a child; when it comes from an adult it's hard not to react in kind.
 It didn't manage to infect me this time, but it did help focus me on the here and now.
 I figured I owed her for that, so I tried to suppress my generally ungracious nature.
 I even let her lead me up the creaky stairs to show me the 'amazing view' for the third time.
 Mom pulled the mirrors out of my hands as soon as I reached the larger bedroom, and nudged me towards the window.
 "Admit it, Adri, we didn't get sunsets like this very often in Minnesota."

He explained, “It’s too late now.
 You’ll never rest until you’ve followed the map.” He was wrong; I’d forgotten my plans, surrendered to my captor.
 I had thought it was over.
 “Yes,” I answered boldly, the word echoing with the thrum of my pulse.
 It made no sense, but I didn’t take the time to think it through, didn’t give him a chance to change his mind.
 I smiled, kicking my heels hard into the horse’s sides.
 The animal jolted forward.
 I gripped the saddle with all my might as its hooves cut the earth.
 I’d never ridden a horse.
 There weren’t any near the village and I’d only ever seen one from the occasional visitor.

Rodregas knew it would be hard, but he was a hard man and he would have to manage.
 Doi’van nodded, then glanced over to see Imeralda walking over with several of the Grimoires and he added, “I was not angry, in fact, by my people’s standards I was being very easy on you since you are human and can’t handle pain like an Orqui.
 Without pain, you will not reach your potential for quickness and reflexes.
 On the practice field such quickness means fewer bruises.
 On the battle field such reflexes means life and death.” Rodregas nodded, his words held the ring of truth, but he was not looking forward to days of practices and days full of bruises.
 The pattern of their days changed.
 Now after prayer and meditation came first the practice of the Kata, and then the staff and then finally the books.
 The true change came in the evening, the nights were full of such pleasure and joy such as Rodregas had seldom known in his life.
 The rest of summer passed as the most joyful that he had known, as the three started to the Kata and the staff.
 After the staff they moved to the bow where Imeralda became the master.

It didn't make sense to be having a panic attack right now, but images of Cindi swam into view, alternating with pictures of Alec and Rachel.
 It was like Alec's cruelty to his sister somehow meant I was failing Cindi.
 I concentrated all of my energy on thinking about Alec, about how much I hated him, about what I was going to say to him next time I saw him.
 Beyond all expectations, it worked.
 My heart rate slowed down to something approaching normal, and the room stopped moving around.
 By the time Mrs. Alexander finished taking the roll, and returned her pencil to its customary place behind her ear, I'd stabilized enough that I could read my notes again.
 The group project was due tomorrow, and since Alec hadn't bothered to make an appearance in class since my first day in Sanctuary, it was looking like I'd have to do the whole thing by myself if I wanted to pass.
 Yet another reason to hate him.
 So far I'd had zero luck figuring out why rain puddles in the parking lot sometimes had colors on them, sort of like little earthbound rainbows.
 I turned around and picked a reference book at random.

Rodregas had suggested to Imeralda that they should stop in case Doi’van walked in, but she had shown no signs of caring and quickly took the thought away from him with her actions.
 Rodregas wanted to ask her what this encounter had meant, but he knew that while such questions were natural they were never helpful.
 Two people fresh from their first lovemaking were in no place to talk about a relationship.
 Rodregas had made a promise to the gods and though she was the most amazing woman in the world, still he would do his duty.
 He tried to find the right thing to say.
 Rodregas looked down at her with her head on his shoulder and her pile of auburn curls spread equally over both their naked bodies.
 Her long hair covered a lot of the two of them but really hid nothing.
 He met her large green eyes and said, “You amaze me.
 I knew you were brave and courageous, but now I know where your true magic talent is...” He looked at her eyes as he spoke and even when he smiled at his own words, he let her see the sincerity of what he said.
 The main rule of flattery with women is to never lie.

 Karen – You were eventually going to inform me what you feel I should call you.

 Something to explain why you, a man self-professed to not being interested in art, is so knowledgeable about Miss Struan.
 Art – Ah yes, well how about ‘Father of Elizabeth’s best friend’?
 It doesn’t really roll off the tongue like ‘Art’ does, on the other hand Art is rather harsh itself.

A number of the strategies briefly listed below are enlarged upon in sub sequent chapters of the report, but listed here for the purpose of comprehensiveness
 1.Emphasize agriculture: Utilize agriculture as a source of economic growth and job creation by a shift to high value-added, commercial crops, supported by policy measures to upgrade technology, improve skills, raise productivity, ensure the supply of essential inputs, establish marketing and distribution chan nels, create linkages between agriculture and industry, and cater to export markets.
 2.Promote small enterprises: Promote small enterprises by policies to make technology, training, credit, marketing and distribution channels more easily accessible to small business, and by forging linkages between universities, research institutes and small enter prises.
 The creation of micro-enterprise banks and credit unions specifically designed to cater to the needs of the self-employed and small firms can be especially effective.
 There are a growing number of these institutions targeting clients that lack access to commercial lending institutions, particularly women, providing unsubsidized loans, and achieving very low levels of default.
 3.Upgrade skills: Absorbing new technology, raising productivity, improving the quality and competitiveness of exports – all depend on the skills of the workforce.
 Labour productivity has been increasing in East Asia by 10 per cent a year, half of which is attributable to investment in education and technical skills.
 Training institutions and programmes in most developing countries provide only a narrow range and low level of skill acquisition to a small portion of the population.
 Raise skills to increase productivity by vastly expanding the lower tiers of the agricultural, craft, technical and vocational training systems at the local level to provide practical training in job-related skills to the saturation point.
 Imbalances between supply and demand for skills exist at all levels in developing economies.

He took the container from my hand.
 “Enough.” My stomach roiled and I realized what I had drunk.
 “Ugh, cat pee.” I thought I might hurl.
 How much of that healing crap had I drunk?
 I heaved once and Steed shook beneath me with laughter.
 I glanced up to find him looking at Chevelle.
 For some reason it angered me, even though I knew Steed wasn’t laughing at him.
 I was talking again, without regard to thought.
 “His mother died, too.
 We killed her.” It sounded so matter-of-fact, my head bobbing along with the words.

“You killed many yesterday,” the man in black said.
 “Do you feel guilt for their deaths?”
 Harruq took a deep breath, analyzing every word before he opened his mouth.
 Velixar could surely tell if he lied.
 But what did he believe?
 Did he even know?
 “I’m not strong like Qurrah,” he said.
 “Sometimes I can be weak.
 Only after, though.
 I will try to never question the order of my master or the will of my brother.”

I don’t know, I started out writing this song because I had fucked this chick, see, when I was on tour, when Lor was back here.
 And she sort of followed me around for a couple of gigs, and it was like a lost week, there, I was all screwed up.
 I wasn’t thinking about Lorelei or what this would mean to her, if anything.
 I just wanted to keep balling this chick, right?
 She was blond and willowy and looked like a pixie and I just couldn’t get enough of her.
 Some of my roadies, and Pete, man, God bless him, he was like ‘Buddy, drop this chick, she’s trouble, man.’  He was thinking of Lor.
 So, anyway, this beautiful woman followed me from city to city—she was a gypsy—and she dressed like a gypsy—I can’t tell you her name cuz you’d know it, man.
 Her heart is a legend.
 But, I didn’t know who she was until I was inside her and she was moving like God’s immaculate machine.
 Damn, she could ball.

The thought made me flush.
 I was staring into someone’s eyes.
 But as quickly as I had come upon him, he was gone.
 He turned from me without a word and disappeared in a few long strides.
 I watched him go.
 Short dark hair, dark eyes, and a large, strong build.
 He certainly wasn’t from this clan.
 Junnie cleared her throat.
 “Freya?” I hadn’t realized she was watching me from the open door.
 I flushed again.

He stood up, taking her hand.
 "It'll be payment for the history lesson."
 Marie exclaimed with excitement when she saw Faneuil Hall--she'd been there many times.
 But she didn't recognize the interior at all.
 It contained all kinds of shops with jewelry, candy, and a variety of other goods that she didn't have a chance to inspect because when Rick realized that there weren't any major clothing stores here, he led her back to the car, and they drove to a huge indoor shopping area he called a mall.
 "Why don't we just buy you something comfortable for now?” he suggested as they went into the nearest store.
 “Something to wear around the house."
 He led her to the ladies’ section.
 "What size pants should we try?"
 "I have no idea."

I didn’t want to continue.
 How could I have been so stupid as to forget it was my mother who had destroyed the northern clans, taken the families from everyone I knew?
 As they stood protecting me, the betrayal I’d felt before was gone.
 In its place was a new hurt, a heart-rending sorrow.
 They heard my sobs.
 I was aware of their eyes on me before they uncomfortably turned away again.
 Chevelle approached me warily as I lay curled in a ball on my blankets, the book positioned in front of me.
 He tossed it aside but I no longer cared.
 He sat behind me and pulled me into his arms, holding me as I wept.
 It was more right than anything had been in a long, long time.

They went out to dinner at fancy restaurants often, and everyone knew their names as they entered.
 He had his own table at several places and the same personal waiter.
 He was treated like royalty.
 I remember he would carry a rare $1000 bill and attempt to pay his bill with it to shock the waiters, who would say, “We can’t change that!” My mom was wearing fur coats and new jewelry all the time.
 Dino was “in the import-export” business; we would later find out that he was involved in a criminal enterprise and during this time was smuggling diamonds.
 It was not unusual for Dino’s associates to come to the house with weapons inside their jackets.
 When they played poker, stacks of hundred dollar bills spilled across the table, and one of the requirements to sit at the table was to put your gun in a pile of weapons across the room.
 I guess they didn’t want the loser to play his trump card with a pistol!
 My brother and I hustled drinks for them for small tips.
 After we were told to go to bed, we would hide behind the counter that blocked the table where they played cards.

He might even still be there, hoping she hadn't gone back, that she was lost somewhere in 2011 and would eventually call out to him to come find her.
 Tears began to run down her cheeks.
 She fell asleep and dreamed that she, her parents, her brother, and Rick were at Cape Cod.
 When she awoke a couple of hours later, she felt feverish.
 Frowning, she felt her forehead.
 No .
 .
 .
 When a breeze stirred the curtains, she realized that it was just the heat of a late July afternoon.
 She'd become accustomed to air conditioning.

Velixar’s army of undead tore the seven apart and cast their remains to the dirt.
 So ended the last life of Cornrows.

 [section break](break.png)
 Harruq halted before the mess that had been his prey.
 The line of undead stood motionless, their unfocused eyes looking nowhere.
 The wind blew through them, shifting their hair and whistling through the holes in their bodies.
 The half- orc said nothing, just stared at the carnage and the servants of his master as he waited for Qurrah.
 The mindless rage that had consumed him slowly faded.
 By the time his brother arrived, it was all but a memory.

Harruq shrugged.
 “Never seemed a big deal to us.
 Others were better off.
 A few were worse.
 We did what we had to live, just like everybody else.”
 He ran a hand through his now shoulder-length hair, shaking away loose strands.
 It felt odd having so little hair on his head.
 Aurelia sat down on her legs, her hands folded upon her dress.
 “Harruq, have you killed before?” she asked.
 The half-orc opened his mouth and then closed it.

 "For what?"
 "For not being able to accept your proposal."
 He rested his forehead against hers.
 "I love you so much, Marie."
 "I love you too."
 "Do you?"
 "Yes."
 She pressed her lips to his.
 He drew her closer.

“Aunt Junnie!” I gushed as she came in.
 She wore a simple hooded cloak, seemingly unafraid as she passed the guards at my door.
 She walked as though she ruled the castle, not as if she were a light elf in the center of a dark lord’s rule.
 She confessed to me a secret her family held, a power I had not known from my mother.
 They had kept it from my father, though he had stolen her after hearing a rumor of it.
 She passed to me many details of her sister, of the family… my family.
 She’d risked so much by coming here, to help me, to help my child.
 I would owe her.
 I had to stop reading as betrayal ripped through me again.
 Junnie.

Finally she decided to go for a walk in the garden to see if the quiet stroll would help her sort out her thoughts and feelings.
 Davis seemed like a different man since they'd become betrothed.
 He didn't have much time for her, and when they were together, he shouted at her.
 But he always apologized.
 Maybe that was part of being a wife--letting him take out his frustrations on her.
 Marie stepped carefully around an azalea bush.
 It was so foggy this morning that she could barely see three feet ahead.
 Plucking one of the magenta blossoms, she raised it to her nose as she continued her stroll and her thoughts.
 She loved being held.
 Last night was the first time he'd held her except when they were dancing and during their brief kisses.

Never that."
 It felt wrong to try and kiss Alec right now.
 I didn't want to make light of Rachel's hurt, or Jasmin's loneliness, but his presence was too great a temptation to pass up.
 My face started out in the hollow of his neck, drinking in the ambrosia of his scent, and then moved up towards his lips without conscious decision on my part.
 Our lips met, and it felt like a warm, pleasant surge of electricity washed from my head down to the tips of my toes.
 My head started spinning almost instantly, only my hand on his chest, and his arms around my waist kept me from losing my balance completely.
 As it was, I still fell into him, overcome by weakness as my heart stopped beating altogether.
 No more than a second or two of breathlessness could have possibly passed, but Alec pulled away, firmly holding me at arm's length.
 "You need to get some sleep.
 Regardless of how the fight turns out, you'll need to be well-rested."

"You both used to be down in the kitchen eating breakfast at the crack of dawn almost every morning.

 I swayed just a little.
 Today it didn't seem quite as bad, as long as I didn't think of her actual name.
 "Mom, I don't want to be late.

“Do you have any food, me be starving, and me brother no be feelin’ too good.

 Qurrah chuckled at the act while his concealed whip writhed about his arm.
 “What is going on?” asked a whiny little voice.
 From the lone tent, a skinny man in purple and red emerged stinking of perfume.
 “It is nothing,” one of the guards said.
 Harruq held in a chuckle.
 It was obvious the guard had little love for the disgusting noble.
 “Nothing?
 By Ashhur, it is the smelliest, dirtiest nothing I have ever seen.

She placed a hand on his shoulder.
 He tensed and jerked away, then blushed at his reaction.
 “Sorry,” Harruq stood up, his face burning red.
 “This is stupid.

 “Stay, please,” Aurelia said.
 The half-orc halted, turned, and sat back down.
 His face was still beet red but the elf paid it no mind.
 “Alright,” Harruq grumbled.
 “No interrupting, and no saying a thing.

The kill would be his.
 “ _Hemorrhage._ ”
 A sudden purging of blood vessels exploded across Ahrqur’s side.
 The force smashed him into a decorative table.
 He rolled off the broken thing and glanced down at the blood soaking his robe.
 Despite the wound, no cut or hole was visible in the cloth.
 “You are pathetic, Ahrqur,” Qurrah said, his hands whirling.
 “You are skilled but you are soft.
 You lack spirit, will.
 It is why you cannot resist my power.

The grip he’d used to steady me became softer and yet, at the same time, his fingers tightened around me.
 My breath hitched as he pulled me against him, the length of our bodies touching.
 My throat went dry, black spots swirling in my vision.
 I fought to stay focused on his face, so close.
 His eyes grew troubled and then he blurred out of vision as I went limp in his arms.
 “Frey…” I opened my eyes to the darkening sky.
 “What happened?” “You seem to have blacked out,” Chevelle said, a hint of some emotion under his reassurance.
 I blushed.
 He must have seen that coming, held me because of it, simply to prevent me from falling on my face.
 I was a fool.

“It is truth.”
 Almost all the spirit’s glow was gone.
 Only hatred and disgust lingered in his eyes.
 “May I be released now, wretched spawn of mine?” Ahrqur asked.
 “Yes.
 Go rest in your shame.
 I have no use for you.”
 The spirit gave Qurrah one last glare then dissipated into the fading light.
 Silence filled the room.
 “Well, what did you think?” asked Harruq.

 He gave the signal two more times before clipping the horn back to his belt and hobbling north.

 Aurelia raced down the twisting back alleys of Celed.
 The dreaded chill of Velixar was far behind her, but still she hesitated to slow.
 Never before had she felt so vulnerable.
 As she stopped to catch her breath, a loud horn call echoed throughout the town.
 The elf sighed, clutching her staff to her chest as she slumped against the side of a house.

A vision of the Grand Council cloaks circling me was convincing enough, but he continued.
 “You will not know their thoughts; you must be ready for any attack.” I nodded, even though part of me was certain there was a less painful way.
 The rock came at me again.
 I couldn’t respond quick enough, couldn’t counter and hold on to a galloping horse in the instant it took him to decide.
 It wasn’t dangerous, but it was like being slapped, and the irritation had me itching to burn something.
 The volley continued and whenever my anger showed, the rock came harder, faster, so I tried to control the emotion or at least hide it.
 That was the hardest part.
 Eventually, I found the best defense was to block the attacks by deflecting them with other objects.
 His magic was too powerful to counter directly and he’d prevented me from ducking away.
 When I was blocking about half the strikes successfully, he pocketed the stone and progressed with sticks, water, fire, anything he found on the trail.

“Gerald was a friend of ours, we went through a lot together in the Raven Keep dungeon,” spoke Audrian.
 “If you are neither him nor Ravenhurr, who are you?
 Only another Immortalist sorcerer should have been able to steal a body from Ravenhurr,” Audrian finished.
 It was a good question and one Rodregas was asking himself.
 He wanted to spill the story, but he did not really trust these men.
 He had spent hard years on the road and knew not to trust people that you have just met.
 You especially do not trust people who try to kill you while you sleep.
 And as long as people thought he might be Ravenhurr, maybe a little crazy from a spell gone wrong or something, the less likely the Guild of the Celestial Path would send the Immortal Guards against him.
 So Rodregas said, “Let’s just say I am trying to figure out who I am.
 You can call me…,” he thought for a minute, making it obvious he was making up a fake name.

 Rachel was shaking, and the blonde looked like someone about to pull the wings off a butterfly.
 I could feel my heartbeat climbing, slamming away at my ribs with all the energy of a full-blown panic attack, but I wasn't dizzy, just scared.
 The cafeteria workers had all turned around so their backs were facing us, a sight which kindled the first spark of anger, an emotion that burned brighter because of the fear still coursing through me.
 There was a gasp as Cassie shoved Rachel, a misleadingly casual motion that sent the smaller girl stumbling back into Alec's chest hard enough to leave bruises.
 The typical catcalls were still absent, it was as if nobody viewed this as a normal fight, like there was somehow more at stake.
 I'd been waiting for someone to intervene on Rachel's behalf.
 It was obvious she knew nothing about fighting.
 Cassie wasn't the kind of girl to fight just to prove a point and then forget about the incident afterwards.
 Just looking at her, I knew she'd remember any slight for as long as she lived, and she had enough influence in the school to make just about anyone's life miserable.

Nobody likes to be told there's something wrong with them, but I can't exactly say everything is just Jim Dandy.
 Not when I still collapse at the mere mention of what I've lost."
 The silence wasn't as comfortable now.
 I had to break it, even if it meant further examining all of the holes inside me that I'd spent so many months struggling to ignore.
 "So you're just one of those guys that can't resist trying to help the broken girls, huh?"
 "No.
 That's Dominic's theory, I didn't say it was mine.
 I did what I did because when I close my eyes I still see you there."
 My heart jumped up to my throat, but in a good way.
 "I don't know why, not really.

"Please, if you won't tell me who it is, let me write a thank you note.
 I have to do something.
 He's done so much for us."
 He stopped partway through shaking his head.
 "I can't promise he'll even bother to read it, but I'll take it to him if you promise never to talk about this again.
 I don't want to hear even the slightest rumor anything unusual happened in association with this project."
 I nodded, relieved I'd have a chance to jot down a couple of lines, that I'd at least have that much of a link with our protector.
 Mayor Wilkenson waited at the door, almost the perfect picture of a gentleman at his leisure, but his desire to be done with this whole affair was almost palpable.
 I hurried back to the kitchen counter and tore a piece of paper off of the tablet I'd been drawing on.
 Whoever you are thank you so much for what you've done.

Every muscle in Harruq’s body tensed, knowing his moment to act would need to be perfect.
 Before he could, a feminine voice shouted down the alley, startling all three.
 “Both of you, stop that this instant!”
 Through blurred vision, Harruq saw a woman with auburn hair standing at the edge of the alley.
 The patrolmen also turned to look, their weapons still in hand.
 “Who the abyss…‌oh, go on back to your forest, Aurelia.
 Nothing to see here.”
 The woman pointed to the bleeding half-orc.
 “I see plenty.”
 “Just cleaning up some filth.” The bowman shifted his bow onto his shoulder.

They didn’t need to, for they had numbers, momentum, and morale.
 When Antonil shoved to the front line, they also had leadership.
 The sixty dwindled to forty before fleeing.
 “Give chase,” Antonil shouted.
 “Those in the back, flush them out of the houses.”
 Velixar watched the Neldaren army scatter, some chasing elves down streets, others barging into locked homes.
 Screams of pain and dying, although just few and random, filled the air.
 He drank it in and smiled.
 “Where are you my disciples?” he asked.
 “Let me hear the screams of your victims so that I may find you.”

He raised first one hand and then the other to his lips.
 "I want to spend my life with you, Marie.
 I understand about your wanting to go home.
 But when you go home, you'll have your family and friends and the excitement of being back, while all I'll have is an empty space where you used to be."
 Her eyes filled with tears.
 "I'm so sorry, Rick.
 It-it probably would have been better for you if I'd never walked into your life."
 "Don't say that!"
 He hugged her.
 "I don't know how I'm going to live without you, but I can't imagine never having loved you.

We will end everything, Harruq.
 Kneel.
 I will show you.”
 Harruq obeyed.
 His insides churned as icy fingers pressed against his forehead.
 Images crackled through his mind.
 The entire world burned to ash and blew away on the wind.
 The painting revealed beneath was in fluid motion, an artwork of death and fire.
 He saw a city burning, people fleeing in the streets, and then he saw himself dressed in black armor that oozed power.
 Salvation and Condemnation waved high above his head, both drenched in blood.

Jim – Since it wasn’t something you said…you must have worn your McDonald’s uniform for gang colors again.
 Eugene – It should have worked, people just don’t seem to understand how tough you have to be to work there.

 It’s a dangerous job.
 The uniform should inspire fear and respect in all who see it.
 I was even wearing my visor backwards!

 Eugene – That’s longer than you lasted janitor-boy, you only made it for like 30 minutes before you quit.

It'd be one less piece of my world crumbling out from under me.
 Britney slammed her tray down, but my listless gaze didn't move from the vacant corner where Brandon usually sat.
 A few minutes later a group of girls came to join us.
 I recognized them, but didn't bother putting names to the faces.
 It was like I got hit with another panic attack.
 Somehow I lost an hour, but nobody was running around calling for an ambulance so I must have at least responded to direct questions.
 Alec was sitting in his normal seat as I wandered into physics.
 I tried to remember whether or not I'd already heard the second bell ring.
 It wasn't important though.
 Not compared to the first thing I'd faced in hours that had the potential to hurt me.

Was he wishing they'd made love?
 Did he sit for hours just as she did, paralyzed with misery and loneliness, constantly thinking about her as she was constantly thinking about him?

 "No, thank you."
 "I don't want you to get sick.
 I'll go get you some juice and a roll, and then we'll go for a drive."
 Marie watched her mother leave.
 She’d drink the juice, but she didn't want to go out.
 All she wanted to do was sit here and think about the man she'd given up.

What then is the justification for predicting a bright future?
 There are political, economic, social and technological forces active in the world today that can override the causality of past trends and combine together to make this a time of unprecedented opportunity.
 Intellectual synthesis: War is the result of a conflict that leads to a forceful resolution followed by a fresh period of progress.
 The end of the Second World War marked the defeat of fascism.
 It gave birth to the United Nations, followed by the dissolution of colonial empires and freedom for more than forty subject nations.
 The end of the Cold War marks the end of a seventy-year confrontation between two opposing ideologies – capitalist and socialist – that reflected a more profound conflict between two fundamental aspects of human existence – individual freedom and social responsibility.
 The posing of these two as opposite and mutually exclusive forces has for long limited our freedom of thought and action and prevented us from boldly experimenting with new ways to reconcile them.
 The peaceful termination of this confrontation has lowered the mental barriers.
 It provides us with an opportunity to synthesize these forces in a manner which balances individual freedom with collective action to eradicate the blatant manifestations of poverty, social injustice and inequity.
 Economic liberalism and rising investment in developing countries: One immediate result of this reconciliation has been the recent movement of economic liberalization spreading throughout the developing world, accompanied by the relaxation of bureaucratic constraints that impede growth.

Imeralda spoke up, “I hope you are not offended, but I am part Nymph and our healing powers work differently than yours.
 She should heal faster for the next few days.” Rodregas hid his smile; it was a good cover story.
 “Thank you,” said the healer.
 “Do you have the strength to heal a few others?
 I think we will lose several more otherwise.” Rodregas could not tell if the healer believed Imeralda’s story or recognized what was going on and was going along with it to save his patients.
 “I would be happy to help them, but I have to do it as privately as possible,” said Imeralda.
 The healer did not seem to take the odd request as being unusual and simply stepped away after leading them to two more patients.
 The healer thanked Imeralda for her healing work and the three were heading out the door when a frail voice called out, “Rodregas, may I speak to you?” Rodregas turned around and noticed for the first time the tall shapely form of Karun who had defeated him with sword and shield.
 She had propped herself up now on the bed and waved them over.
 Her arm was clearly broken and her side was bandaged.

"Still unacceptable.
 You've all aired your opinions; you can retire to your beds now."
 James looked up from where he'd been slouching against the wall, and I suddenly realized that he wasn't shaking from cold.
 He was so furious it looked like he was only seconds away from exploding.
 A very pretty Hispanic girl placed a gentle hand on his arm, but he shook her hand off and let out a sound that was uncomfortably close to a growl.
 "You selfish jerk.
 You've been mooning over her for weeks.
 You've got her now, but at what cost?
 This isn't open to discussion.
 We're taking her back to Brandon and asking for leniency."

The experience of the past four decades strongly supports the view that government can play a vital role in stimulating agriculture up to the stage where the rural economy demonstrates the dynamism needed to take off on its own.
 Although the Green Revolution has been widely heralded as an achievement of modern technology, the hybrid seeds and chemical-based cultivation practices that formed the technological basis for the breakthrough in foodgrain production constitute only one part of a comprehensive, integrated development strategy in which government played a central and crucial role.
 This strategy included massive, country-wide demonstration programmes to introduce farmers to new technology, the establishment of new public sector agencies for rapid multiplication and distribution of seeds, assured markets and guaranteed floor prices for foodgrains to eliminate fear that higher production would result in crashing prices, construction of additional storage capacity to house the increased production, import or manufacture of fertilizers, and, most importantly, for transport, distribution and marketing of surplus grains in food deficit areas.
 Few developing countries – perhaps few countries at any stage of development – could have marshalled resources on such a massive scale and instituted such widespread changes so rapidly without heavy reliance on the government for both planning and execution.
 In the majority of developing countries, government is still the most organized and efficient agency and the only one capable of such significant initiative.
 In formulating strategies, it is essential to take fully into account both the stages and steps of the development process.
 At this stage in their development, it is highly unlikely that food-deficit African nations can make rapid progress toward food self-sufficiency without strong government support and investment to improve technology, training, techno-infrastructure and trade.
 Once the rural sector begins to exhibit its own dynamism, as in the majority of developing countries, there is strong justification for a shift in the role of government from that of prime mover, planner and controller of development to that of catalyst and pioneer.
 Government agencies can tap the potentials of agriculture, identifying new commercial opportunities, educating farmers, demonstrating new potentials, assisting in the transfer and dissemination of new technology, and promoting the establishment of effective organizations – preferably privately or co-operatively owned by farmers or at least with their participation – to process, distribute and market what is produced.
 Coping with the environmental problems to preserve the ecological foundations essential for sustainable agriculture is an area in which government has special responsibilities and must play a leading role on an ongoing basis.

I’d been around fire magic for as long as I could remember.
 It had never burnt me or any other elf as far as I knew; it would only burn what it was meant to burn.
 I glanced back down at the scroll, realizing the fire magic had been meant to burn.
 I should never have read the words aloud.
 I carefully picked it up and rolled it back in place, certain I would never read from it again.
 Binding the pouch as I had found it, I tucked it into the pack.
 When I checked my hands to decipher the lines, I realized I was seeing a map.
 Yes, it was burned into my palms, but it was a map.
 I couldn’t fathom why anyone would have a ridiculous spell like that, and then it struck me that it had come from the vault, from my own family’s things.
 I bit down hard on my lip, fighting the impulsive urge that always got me into trouble.

Yeah, what the hell?
 Why aren’t we allowed to adopt him?
 Johnny – Well Eugene’s father’s attorney found some obscure law that said that Gene could never be adopted by anyone while the father was still alive.
 Jim – That’s it?
 Johnny – Yep, the judge ruled in favor of Gene’s father.
 As long as he’s alive Gene needs his permission to be adopted by anyone.
 Gene’s father wouldn’t ever let that happen because Gene would be happy.
 The bastard is a total sadist.

As we passed strip joints whose signage featured females twice as buxom as Lil' Abner's Daisy Mae, doormen beckoned and dared us to enter, though we were four years underage.
 We stood gawking at the posters on jazz clubs.
 Miles Davis, Gerry Mulligan, Stan Getz, Horace Silver, Coltrane, George Shearing.
 Sylvia had taught Eric to revere and me to appreciate those fellows.
 We shot pool at Mike’s, where Kerouac had drunk plenty, according to Big Sur.
 We slouched in the catacombs of City Lights bookstore reading apocalyptic poems and hoping for a glimpse of the owner, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the poet who loaned Kerouac his Big Sur cabin.
 We roamed alleys and climbed hills no doubt mistaking mathematicians, who commuted daily to San Jose, for poets or novelists.
 Everybody who looked at home, we imagined had flopped in the Beat boarding houses Kerouac immortalized, or at least listened to the man speak his words in the Cellar, accompanied by a jazz riffing tenor sax.
 We overdosed on espresso.
 Then, as we climbed a hill to recover, I recited a jumble of lines I remembered from Ginsberg's Howl: "I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix, wandered around and around at midnight in the railway yard wondering where to go, and loned it through the streets of Idaho seeking visionary Indian angels, and lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup, a hopeless task, and so took ship and disappeared into the volcanoes of Mexico leaving nothing behind but the shadow of dungarees and the larva and ash of poetry..." And I recited from On the Road about the children crying in Iowa where they let the children cry and where "the evening star must be drooping and spreading her sparkler dims on the prairie, which is just before the coming of complete night that blesses the earth, darkens the all rivers, cups the peaks and folds the final shore in."

"Alec!"
 The last thing I was expecting out of Rachel was for her to all but run towards Alec with her arms out as if expecting a hug.
 Even so, that was less surprising than the fact that Alec accepted the hug, turning slightly to the side to receive her, but still reaching out with his left arm to pull her in close, albeit only briefly.
 "You didn't think I'd forget, did you?"
 "Not forget, no, just maybe be a little late."
 As abruptly as that, the interplay between the two siblings ended, leaving an uncomfortable silence as odd as the affection from a moment before.
 We walked to Alec's car in silence, the pair of them apparently lost in their own thoughts, and me wondering why Alec had agreed to give me a ride home.
 I wasn't enough of a car aficionado to recognize the vehicle other than the fact that it was a matte gray and had the kind of smooth, exotic lines all of the high-end vehicles seemed to be striving for right now.
 Rachel slipped in the backseat while I was still wondering how this seemingly low-profile ride matched up against Brandon's Mustang.

Better because without Alec sitting six feet away from me I was able to think about something other than him, worse because we had a pop quiz and I barely placed in the A- range despite having spent a fair amount of time on my vocabulary.
 Math was plain and simply burning up too much time.
 Something needed to change because my only hope of going to college was to get a scholarship, or load up on student loans, and I had no desire to graduate sixty thousand dollars in debt and spend the next fifteen years trying to pay it all off.
 By the time I met up with Britney in the hall I was emotionally exhausted and could feel an attack hovering in the wings.
 Much as I'd have liked to, I couldn't continue to blow her off.
 She was my only friend, and I definitely didn't want her spreading the kind of rumors about me that she routinely spread about everyone else.
 "Wow, you look like crap.
 Are you going to collapse like you did last night?"
 "Thanks, Brit.

 Is that another thing mothers teach their daughters?
 How to drink like a room full of men?
 Liz – Well my mother taught me how to do it, I don’t know about what ‘normal’ mothers do with their daughters.
 But that is one of the valuable life skills that I learned under my mother’s tutelage.
 Jim – Might come in handy one day, maybe your true calling is to open a bar, and fleece customers out of their money in fixed drinking contests.
 Liz – Maybe, and maybe you can be my tough but honest bouncer.
 Jim – Could I carry a sword or something?
 Liz – Would you use it?
 Jim – Only on people who insisted on singing karaoke, when it’s obvious that they have no talent for singing whatsoever.

Every moment we spent together made me want to touch him that much more, but the idea of being addicted to anyone, even him, was more than a little unsettling.
 "Sure, Rachel tells me I'm entirely unreasonable on at least a daily basis."
 I stuck my tongue out at him, and started back through the book in search of the missing information.
 There were so many other ways I'd rather be spending our time together, but he was adamant I not fall further behind in my classes.
 I looked up to ask for a hint, and found him staring off into space.
 "Penny for your thoughts?"
 His smile was a half-hearted thing.
 "Mother is playing again.
 She just finished up with 'Courtship', so the next one will be 'Welcoming'."
 It was amazing how quickly I could forget his supernatural abilities.

Besides, this is where you'll find the copies of all your textbooks."
 It must have been obvious I wasn't convinced, but Donovan wasn't dissuaded.
 He pointed to the cell phone, still grasped uncomfortably in my hand.
 "In the event that you need something, it is likely you can just say my name and I'll hear you.
 If not, that wonderfully infernal device is, I believe, programmed to call me if you hold down the number nine.
 I am of course completely at your service."
 I opened my mouth to protest, but moving much too quickly, even with his painful-looking limp, to be a normal human, he'd already vanished around the corner.
 I stood awkwardly in the doorway for several minutes, but I couldn't resist the draw of all those books forever.
 I finally broke down and started tracing various spines as I decided which one I'd start with.
 Unfortunately I found the textbooks before I made a final decision, and then guilt over how poorly I was doing in Biology and Spanish won out.

At home Mrs. Tranton handed Marie some aspirin and a glass of water and suggested she go to her room for a nap.
 Marie went upstairs but didn't feel like lying down.
 Instead, she sat on her bed with her back against the headboard and her arms wrapped around her knees.
 Why did she feel so frightened?
 This was almost how she'd felt when she'd wandered into 2011.
 But then she'd been in a strange place; now she was home.
 She should be ecstatic.
 She'd tried for over five weeks to get home.
 Tuesday she'd spent a delightful day with her family, the best of her adult life.
 Her father had amazed her by showing her his love in a variety of ways.

“Jesus sought me when a stranger, wandering from the throne of God, He to rescue me from danger, bought me with his precious blood.”
 And for the first time ever, I thought, my God, Eric died for me.
 I believe our minds go far deeper than the part that allows us to reason.
 When we encounter an idea and it seems to brighten our consciousness and lead to a wealth of new insights, we should trust it at least as much as we trust a reasoned argument.
 Because if we look close enough at almost any reasoned argument, we can find a flaw or logical fallacy.
 My first year in college, I majored in philosophy.
 The second class opened with ancient Greeks.
 The professor set these philosophers’ arguments against each other.
 Next she used Roman arguments to refute the Greek who prevailed over the earlier Greeks.
 Then she applied the arguments of medieval scholastics to refute the Romans, and some arguments of Renaissance philosophers to refute the scholastics, and so on.

Rick opened her hotel room door for her and gave her the key.
 "I'm not going to have them wake us up.
 Just come knock on my door whenever you get up."
 "OK."  She smiled up at him dreamily.
 "This evening has been like a fairy tale.
 Even if we left tomorrow, I'd be happy."
 "Good."
 He stroked her cheek with one finger.
 "That's all I want."
 Her heart began pounding when she realized he was going to kiss her goodnight.

It really was on the 13th floor of the hospital—I thought they didn’t mark the 13th floor, out of some ancient Masonic superstition among builders and steamfitters.
 This is what I told the doctors—no wonder they kept me, right?
 I mean, I got off that elevator on the 13th floor—Lor was literally holding me up—and I freaked out just because of the number.
 That was just the beginning of my wondrous captivity, my imprisonment in the tower.
 I had to stay there until the angels came to get me.
 CM:  	How long were you, um, kept?
 BG:  	Shit, what was it, Lor?
 Three weeks, a month.
 LE: 	About 9 weeks, dear.

 What was it called?
 Uh.
 “Fainting Spell, A Bagatelle.”  That was it.
 By The Holly and IV.
 I can’t tell you who that really is.
 CM:  	Ok, um, the next song on Rain and Other Distractions, the penultimate song, before the finisher, “Goodbye to the Shell,” is this odd little folk song, “Right on Poplar Avenue.”
 BG: 	Yeah, that’s Lor’s song, actually.

“Uh Seth I don't think this is the best time to mention this but I think we have company.” I pointed to the shape.
 He swore under his breath, and we both entered the dwarf's world together.
 Sure enough, it was a dwarf but there was something strangely different about this particular dwarf.
 He just walked toward us as if he wasn't afraid that I might put an arrow through his head.
 Just as I was about to release my arrow, the dwarf cried, “Please stop!” I don’t know why I listened to him but I didn’t pull the string.
 The dwarf was acting different than the others; its pudgy eyes were filled with fear at the sight of my arrow.
 “Why?” Seth growled.
 “Your kind has done nothing good to us except make us confused and our lives more complicated.” The dwarf looked startled.
 “Oh you’ll have to excuse my brethren; they have a tendency to be rather annoying.” He took a long frightened look at Seth’s sword.
 “Good sir, before you try to slay me, I have a message to deliver from her majesty.” I lowered my bow because I had a feeling I wanted to know what this message was.

Art – I’ve seen you eat two entire large pizzas, and then sit down on the couch and watch television until you fall asleep and not gain a pound, exercising can’t be much of a consideration for you.
 Eugene – Where did you think I burned off all those pizza calories?
 The Gym?
 Ha!
 I run, a lot, it’s kept me out of trouble on more times than I can count.
 Art – Well considering you can only count to ten that fact doesn’t impress me all that much.
 Eugene – Funny.
 Art – Yes it was.
 Well, it was an interesting story.

The ring tone surprised me, as it was a sound I wasn’t accustomed to hearing.
 At first I thought it was a sound on the car radio but quickly realized it must be Ashley.
 She was obviously the only person who had this number and she was very apologetic for the failure to show.
 Ashley said she wanted to get the Oxys as soon as possible and that there would be no problems this time, as she knew Steve was completely out of product and would meet me on my terms.
 In a judgment call that I had not previously planned, I flatly told her that I already sold the Oxys through the other buyer that I had told her about.
 She was notably upset and actually confronted me on my “promise” to sell them to her.
 I pointed out that I waited in a parking lot for her for over an hour and she was the one who flaked.
 I described how easy it was to sell the one hundred Oxys to the other guy and that he met me exactly where I wanted and when I wanted, gave me the cash and it was a breeze!
 She asked me if I had any more and I told her I had a few but not enough to trouble with.
 I then told her that I had a refill available for ninety Oxys that was good to fill next Tuesday.

I held onto that hope right up until I saw Mrs. Sorenson joining everyone else in staring at me whenever I looked down at my book.
 There was no mistaking the look on her face; it was utter distaste, possibly with a dash of disdain.
 I was so tired of it all.
 By the time English rolled around my natural embarrassment had given way to actual anger at Britney for starting it all.
 She tried to catch me at our lockers in between classes, but I pretended not to hear her, and made it safely into Mr. Whethers' class before she could catch up.
 Part of me acknowledged how petty it was, but I avoided her attempts at a whispered conversation during class.
 Mr. Whethers unknowingly helped my cause, when he crossly silenced a couple of girls on the far side of the classroom.
 He was normally so even-tempered that even his moderate rebuke instantly shut them up.
 I probably shouldn't have felt quite so happy about it, but I was pretty sure from the way they'd been looking at me that I'd been the source of their gossip.
 When the bell finally released us, I couldn't avoid Britney any longer.

"Jasmin just left."
 "What's wrong with that?"
 "It's not safe for her to leave the estate.
 Brandon's pack could be waiting for her."
 He started to move, but I held onto him.
 "Alec, she'll probably be okay.
 I know it isn't the best idea but please don't stop her.
 Not tonight."
 It was like I could see the thoughts dart around as he put pieces together, and I was suddenly torn between telling him in the hopes it would buy Jasmin her last night with Ben, and trying to keep her secret.
 My heart raced until he finally relaxed and sank back down with me.

Seth stood watching, terrified.
 He didn’t have a clue as what to do to fight these invisible creatures.
 None of us did, at that time, because we didn’t know what was going on.
 The world was still a normal place to us at the time.
 Something grabbed Seth’s legs and pulled him against a tree.
 He kicked and punched but couldn’t find the right place to hit his attacker.
 “Hold on!” Jason yelled.
 I opened my mouth to say that we already were when he vanished.
 Dragged away was my guess.
 My legs shot with pain.

Yes, he did know.
 Over the past few months, he had killed seven men and carried their bodies to his brother.
 “I still have at least a week,” Harruq said.
 “Give me until then, alright?
 We could use the money.”
 “I have saved much of what you earned,” Qurrah said.
 “We will be able to eat, not well, but enough to live.”
 “If you say so,” Harruq said.

“The entire village of Cornrows is missing,” Dieredon said.
 “Most likely dead.”
 Harruq’s breathing quickened.
 His hands tightened around the hilts of his weapons.
 “I had nothing to do with it,” he said.
 “Why would I?”
 “Children have been dying since you arrived here in Woodhaven,” Dieredon replied.
 “Butchered, intestines removed, strange carvings on the bodies, and pieces of them missing.

"I love you too, sweetheart."
 Slowly she backed out of his arms.
 She wanted to say something else .

 but there was nothing else to say.
 Swallowing, she squeezed his hand and turned away.
 As she walked into the garden, she was tempted to turn and look back.
 But that would just heighten their pain.
 With tears running down her cheeks, she quickened her steps.

Is that clear?”
 Harruq nodded, shivering as he felt the tip of the blade rubbing against the tender skin of his throat.
 “Good.
 Pleasant days, half-orc.
 May Celestia watch over you…‌and condemn your actions to death.”
 The biting tip left his throat, the blades in the bow retracted, and then the elf vanished.
 Harruq struggled to his feet, clutching his neck as he gasped for air.
 “Damn elf,” he cursed.
 “How dare you threaten us.”
 His hands shook violently as his adrenaline faded.

 Do I have to be sure?

No killing.
 He may not be the Forest Butcher, and even if he meant to do what she feared, it didn’t mean the others were him.
 The hope felt juvenile and ignorant but she clung to it tightly.
 The magic left her fingertips, and doing her best to calm her heart, she followed Harruq back home.
 “Nothing?” Qurrah asked when Harruq stepped inside.
 “Nothing.”
 It seemed Qurrah would leave it at that, but he clearly saw the apprehension on his brother’s face.
 “Tell me the truth,” he said.
 “What happened?”
 Harruq sighed, and he removed his swords and flung them to the ground.

I started to command the horse to kneel, but then Steed grabbed me at the waist and threw me up.
 I took one deep breath before we kicked the horses into a gallop and ran from the fort in a pack.
 Our pace finally slowed as the way became too treacherous.
 Massive rock formations loomed over us, loose stones underfoot causing the horses to stumble.
 The haze was so thick I couldn’t see anything but the riders in front of me.
 I only knew from the strain on my legs we were heading up, climbing higher into the gray sky and biting wind.
 Chevelle rode beside me through the day.
 When we stopped for the evening, he pulled me down from my horse and stayed near as we sat on large stones around a fire.
 Ruby was telling stories again and everyone gave her their full attention… everyone but us.
 “How do you feel?” he asked.

The Nymph slowly helped him up and held a bowl to his mouth.
 “My name is Durien and I am healer, please slowly drink this.
 Rinse your mouth out with it as your mouth is probably very dry after all this time.” The drink tasted like tea or maybe a light broth.
 As soon as Rodregas started to drink it, he realized he was starving.
 “I need more,” Rodregas croaked as he finished the bowl.
 The Nymph, an older man who unlike any Nymph Rodregas was familiar with, had his hair pulled back in a pony tail, nodded but said, “Slowly, too much right away is not good for you.” Rodregas nodded and cleared his throat; which was dry and felt like it had pebbles in it.
 While the bed was normal enough, the walls of the room were strange and seemed to be made of woven branches and some sort of hide or dark canvas pulled between tree branches to form an oval shape.
 “Doi’van and Imeralda, do they live?” he got the words out, though it hurt his throat to speak.
 “Oh, yes, Imeralda is fine,” the Nymph healer responded.
 “She was not hurt at all.

The dying heap of flesh collided against two other men, knocking them back and delaying their attack.
 He mocked them, adrenaline flooding his veins.
 “Is that all you can do?” he screamed.
 “Where’s the fun in this?”
 “Here’s your fun,” one said, stabbing at Harruq’s side from behind.
 The blade punctured the black armor and bit into flesh.
 The half-orc roared, and then twisted so fast it left the expert guard breathless.
 His upper body jerked left to prevent the sword from going in any further.
 Salvation swung around, ringing against the blade.
 Condemnation followed through, aimed straight for the guard’s throat.

Instead he looked completely at ease sitting in one of the no-man's-land tables with a pair of books open in front of him.
 By the looks of things he wasn't going to need any help.
 Once it was just the four of us, Britney waved me over and held up her homework.
 "I don't get it.
 What is the answer to this one?"
 I shook my head in exasperation.
 "Me telling you the answers won't help you on the test.
 If you have a specific question about how to work a problem I'd be more than happy to help you, but I'm not going to do your homework for you."
 Britney looked like she had all kinds of things that she'd like to say, but she showed more restraint that I'd realized she was capable of, and kept them all inside.
 "Please explain this one then."

Chapter Six Trails
 Chevelle kept a quick pace and I found myself struggling to keep up.
 Unlike me, he wasn’t dodging between rocks and trees, bending out of sight and watching the ground to keep from breaking twigs while he tried to keep from being spotted.
 I cursed the formal dress I’d been dragging as it snagged on a low-lying thicket, flinging another string of beads into the soft dirt.
 I considered dumping it, but didn’t think it was the best idea to be sneaking around the forest unclothed.
 After crossing a few soggy patches of moss, the hem was damp and darkened.
 I might have ripped some of the excess material off, but Chevelle’s movement wasn’t leaving me time for that.
 Finally, just before nightfall, he approached a small village.
 It didn’t look like more than half a dozen structures scattered against the base of a large hill.
 He dropped the simple pack he’d been carrying beside a tree and hunched down as he slowed his pace.

 I couldn’t help it.
 I giggled.
 Evelyn shot a glower at me.
 And then she whirled, storming away, and as she glanced back, her parting expression was so priceless I wished I could see it again.
 “Achoo!” “Choo!” “Hachoo!” My ears popped as I burst out with laughter.
 Evelyn began to run toward town and I couldn’t stifle it, despite the fact that it was absurd something as insignificant as a sneeze would give me such pleasure.

 But I can’t wait until September!
 And what if that book isn’t right?” Rick hugged Marie, wiping away her tears.
 He led her inside and made her breakfast, which she barely touched.
 Nothing he said drew much of a response from her.
 He hated leaving her when she was so upset, but after a week’s vacation, he had a ton of work at the office.
 “Call me if you need anything, sweetheart,” he told her, kissing the top of her head just before he left.
 Marie watched him leave and then, with a sigh, rose and went to the living room, still wearing her 1927 clothes.
 She’d tried so hard to get back this morning.
 She’d worn only her 1927 clothes, and her mind hadn’t wandered to 2011 at all.

He'd already been picking me up from school every morning and dropping me off most days.
 We now spent every lunch together, and he'd started lingering when he dropped me off.
 It was still only on the days when Mom wasn't home, and I hadn't quite mustered the guts to invite him in, but it'd still been really nice.
 Of course it'd been the logical kind of thing to have start happening after someone asked you to the Ashure Day Dance.
 It was still so amazing someone like Brandon had asked me to go to a dance that half the time I forgot all about it.
 The other half of the time I had a hard time believing it'd really happened.
 But it had, and there were more than four dozen roses scattered around our kitchen to prove it.
 Predictably, Brandon didn't do anything halfway.
 I'd gone to school on Tuesday after receiving his amazing, 'anonymous' gift the day before, only to be ambushed at lunch.
 I'd been anxiously waiting for him at his normal table when a pair of employees from the local florist had walked in, their arms overflowing with roses.

Lucky for her, we lost her in the crowd.
 In the car, Cliff and I didn’t mention surrendering.
 We drove to a party, and told nobody about Billy Graham.
 We stayed in the kitchen, drank a couple beers and talked baseball with a few lonely guys.
 A card game started, but poker is no fun if you don’t care who wins.
 The only girls were hanging on their boyfriends.
 So we left.
 In the Chevy, Cliff said, “Tijuana?” “Sure,” I said.
 “Why not?” On Avenida Revolución, even when nothing was happening, you knew any second most anything could.
 Police could falsely charge you with some offense, so you would pay them to let you go.

While the equipment was all of average quality, Rodregas was smiling because clearly there were three sets of everything plus a pack horse for equipment.
 Imeralda was clearly planning on joining them.
 While that is what his heart hoped for he was not sure if it was the smartest move.
 When they were working on the tack for the horses, he went ahead and asked.
 “Imeralda, I want to make sure you want to continue with us.
 I mean I love to travel with you, but while Doi’van and I are warriors, when you joined us it was only as a travel companion.
 If you want to stay with the village or stay with Jordaan I will understand.
 You know that by now they will be hunting us, if not because of Ravenhurr’s death, than because of the missing Immortal Guards.” “You know that I probably killed more slavers with the Black Yew bow than either you or Doi’van right?” asked Imeralda with a snort.
 “Your abilities are not of question,” Rodregas responded.
 “Your abilities as a Forest Nymph and as an archer make you a very deadly woman.

 To me, the key to living well is living in a way that gives an opportunity for appreciating nature and friends and taking time for prayer and writing and helping people.
 And unless you inherit a pile of money, the way to live like that is to not want a lot of stuff.
 Most stuff is just clutter.
 But our culture feeds the desire to own or consume until what we think we need makes us greedy.
 “The Bible says that we should work so we’ll have something to share with people in need.

Harruq relished the feeling of true combat against skilled opponents.
 One would slash out, hoping for an opening, then back away as the other guard lunged, preventing Harruq from any chance to counter.
 Blood ran down his arms and sides from several minor cuts.
 The pain was good.
 It helped focus his mind.
 It also fed his rage.
 “Kill me,” he shouted to one guard after another hit and fade.
 He smacked away a thrust but did not attempt to counter.
 “Can you not kill me?” he asked, holding his swords out wide.
 Neither one attacked, instead holding their swords in defensive positions.

Well there's a present for you in the living room, but since you didn't want to celebrate until after school, you'll have to wait to open it."
 I could definitely hear the rumble of a high-performance engine.
 I nodded again, and turned to go, hopeful that I could avoid the inevitable question of why Brandon was coming to pick me up in the mornings as well as dropping me off most afternoons.
 Unfortunately, Mom's hearing was nearly as good as mine, and she was walking towards the windows before I managed to get the door open.
 "Adri, who's that?"
 It was obviously one of those leading questions designed to see whether or not I'd try to lie.
 I shrugged.
 "His name is Brandon; he picks me up sometimes in the morning."
 I was saved from dealing with her response by Brandon's knock.

I waited expectantly, and he finally resumed.
 "To answer your question, I wasn't always like this.
 When I was younger I saw exactly the way that you do.
 Even now, my vision is more like yours when I'm in this form.
 I still see incredibly well, and there's just the slightest hint of light from living things, but nothing like what you saw in the dreams."
 "So you work from memory mostly then?
 That and trying to make what you see when you're in human form even more drab than what you really see?"
 "That about sums it up, although I didn't really expect you to pick up on that last part so quickly.
 You're remarkably perceptive."
 I felt my face heat at the compliment.

 "Oh, Rick."
 Her tears began coming faster.
 He tried to draw her closer, but she stiffened and then stood up.
 “Where-where are those books about time travel?” she asked, wiping her eyes.
 “In my office.” “I want to look at them again to see if I can find something that we missed.” “OK—I’ll help you.” “No.”  She shook her head, glancing at him but unable to meet his gaze.
 “I-I need to do it alone, OK?” “OK.” He watched her go, his heart heavy.

Funny how I'd never thought there was anything wrong with it before, but after finally being rewarded with something more than his normal, serious countenance, I had the first hint why he was one of Rachel's favorites among the pack.
 "It's likely I'll be exceedingly sore for the next few days, and my ego, such as it is, will likely take quite the beating, but our Kir'shan, our Alpha as you would say, isn't a bad sort."
 That was a relief.
 It also meant I knew exactly what I was going to do when I saw Alec next.
 Half an hour later, I was following him down the hall towards Physics and wishing I'd had more time to prepare.
 Alec slowed as we finally arrived outside the door to Mrs. Alexander's classroom.
 I carefully craned my head around him, half expecting to see Brandon's entire pack waiting to ambush us.
 Instead the pause seemed to have been caused by the fact Mrs. Alexander had been replaced by a sub.
 "Do you mind if we don't go to Physics today?"
 Alec's question should have been lost in the clamor of all of the kids walking by us, but I picked his voice out as easily as if we'd been alone together in the forest.

Cassy & Mark, I'm glad you both turned out to be story addicts just like me.
 Thanks for everything.
 Dad, not everyone gets to be best friends with their parents.
 Thanks for all of the feedback and the ongoing support.
 Mimi, thanks for sticking with me long enough to get addicted and to fix some of my biology facts along the way.
 As always, Katie deserves special thanks.
 Without her, Alec and Adri's story never would have seen the light of day.
 Thanks need to be expressed to Obsidian Dawn, www.obsidiandawn.com, for brushes used in the creation of Broken's cover.
 Finally, a big thanks to the bloggers who've kindly reviewed Broken and Torn, done interviews and otherwise gone over and above by sharing their platform.

 He was either a monster now, or he was a warrior fighting for justice.
 He struggled up to his feet and said, “Go get the figurine out of my trunk, keep it hidden.
 Doi’van and I will meet you outside of the infirmary.” Rodregas was pleased that neither Doi’van nor Imeralda actually looked surprised.
 He was not the only one who had decided that someone had to start doing the right thing and that they were those people.
 As Rodregas and Doi’van met Imeralda outside the infirmary doors, he could hear the sound of people in pain coming through the doors.
 The sight inside was not pretty.
 It was not the warm and open space of the Nymph’s healing room, but full of crowded cots and kneeling chatting figures in the yellow robes of healers.
 Rodregas was sore himself.
 Even walking shot pain up his shoulders and into his neck.

Chapter 13 Morning came not a moment too soon after a night filled with tossing and turning.
 Every time I nodded off, I awoke a few minutes later, my mind reaching for something that wasn't there, only to snap back as it didn't find what it was looking for.
 Each time the backlash woke me up, I tried to figure out what was going on, but I didn't succeed until nearly morning.
 I'd been trying to find the vivid dreams again.
 I'd finally stopped thinking about them, finally stopped yearning for them every night, only to have my stupid subconscious somehow mix them up with real life.
 That was really the thing that was the most unnerving.
 I'd only ever unconsciously drawn real places.
 To draw a pretend place was surprisingly unsettling, but I almost couldn't blame whatever part of me had gotten confused.
 The dreams were so clear and sharp they sometimes seemed more real than the rest of my life.
 By the time I finally realized what was keeping me from getting real sleep it was too late to worry about trying to get anymore rest.

"It's just sooo hard for my merely human ears to hear you from so far away.
 Maybe if you were to move over here I wouldn't have to strain to catch every word."
 It was so blatantly coy, I almost couldn't believe I was saying it.
 It had been said though.
 All there was left to do was hope he didn't decide I was the biggest loser to ever walk the earth.
 The extended silence was almost enough to make me decide he was going to get up and leave.
 "All right, I'll come over and lean against your bed, but you really need to try and sleep.
 You've got to be nearly exhausted."
 "What about you, mister superhero shape shifter?

A blending of their values and methods – freed from the blinkers of dogma and the determinism of limited imagination – can lead us to the answer.
 Wider Perspective on Transitions
 The outcome of all great social transformations – of which the present instance ranks in magnitude and importance with that of the French Revolution and the movement which freed India and so many other former colonies from imperialism, economic exploitation and cultural domination – depends on the degree to which individuals and institutions within the society have been prepared to understand, accept and respond to the new environment ushered in by the transition.
 Two hundred years ago the people of France were ready to overthrow the old order but ill-prepared to create anything new, with the result that the old soon re-established itself and lived on for another century.
 It took India’s leaders more than four decades to prepare their people for freedom and it has taken another four to overcome the vestiges of colonial rule that prevented the country from releasing its energies for prosperity.
 Long after the foreign conquerors had left, colonialism lived on in the institutions of government and in the attitudes of the population.
 Decades of freedom and education were needed for the country to outgrow a sense of inferiority, a seeking for security, a feeling of submissiveness and complacency, and to acquire a sense of pride, ambition, high aspirations and expectations, a seeking for achievement, and a spirit of adventure and enterprise – and still the task is not complete.
 Development is like a chemical reaction that is determined by the variety and quantity of elements present and the conditions under which they are put together.
 If one essential element or condition is missing, a social transition like a chemical reaction may not take place at all.
 The absence of peace in war-torn Africa or democratic freedoms in former colonial nations, the absence of social stability or an entrepreneurial class, the absence of a functioning banking or educational system, the absence of the minimum necessary infrastructure for transportation and communication – any one of these may be enough to prevent transition until the deficit is made up.

I tried to feel my arms, see if they were still there.
 Was that why I couldn’t move?
 Was I still tied to a wall?
 No, no, I wasn’t tied.
 Had the thorns been poisoned?
 Was I dying now?
 I worked to calm myself.
 No, I was getting better, not worse.
 I felt a light pressure on my forehead and my eyes flew open instinctively, though I’d had no response from them all the hours I’d struggled to force them open.
 It was Ruby.

I'd....actually I wasn't sure why it'd been a hard day, but something told me I'd unconsciously been at the end of my rope just before I'd collapsed.
 Unfortunately that same thing told me I couldn't dwell here in the comforting absence, there was a very important reason for me to regain my feet.
 The void was reluctant to let me go, stripping me of memories and experiences as I fought my way free.
 By the time I was near surfacing I no longer remembered just how much I'd wanted to stay.
 Britney was pacing back and forth when I opened my eyes.
 She had her cell phone out and was looking like she wanted to dial 911, but was worried about the possible fallout.
 I was on the ground, which for some reason made me more irritable than it should have.
 Didn't she realize how hard it was to make it over to someone before collapsing like that?
 It kind of defeated the whole point if they then put you on the ground where your clothes would take their normal, instantaneous-collapse beating.
 "Oh my gosh, are you okay?

Movement up the mountain caught my eye and I looked to Chevelle in alarm.
 Though he appeared calm, he was staring in the same direction.
 A dark cloaked figure advanced in the dusk, the full cape covering every part of its owner, drawn hood shielding their face.
 Chevelle nodded in greeting as I scanned the area for others who might approach.
 The stranger seemed alone, and reached Chevelle first, since he stood nearer to the horses than me.
 The newcomer whispered to him, and Chevelle’s eyes flicked my direction more than once.
 Curiosity burned through me.
 And then a delicate hand reached out to pass Chevelle a package.
 Her fingers lingered against his during the exchange and my chest felt like it was blistering inside.
 They were whispering about me.

trusting.
 She trusted him not to hurt her, to do what was best for her.
 Groaning, he rolled off her.
 Marie immediately pushed herself up and over to lie on top of him, her mouth claiming his again.
 He couldn't help returning her kiss, but when she began kissing his neck, he croaked, "Sweetheart, please stop."
 She paused for just a second.
 But then she ran her hand over his chest, nibbling on his earlobe as she whispered, "I don't think I can."
 He groaned again.
 It had taken all the strength he had to make himself stop.
 If she kept kissing him, no power on earth, no amount of love or guilt would be able to make him stop.

Alec shifted the phone slightly, I couldn't hear whoever was on the other end anymore, but whatever they'd just said hadn't made things any better.
 The invisible ants marching up my arms went to double time and the metaphysical breeze that started on his skin and went outward turned into a full-blown gale.
 "Stall them.
 We'll be down in eight minutes if worse comes to worst you two contain Isaac and tell Dom to sit on Jack.
 Keep Rachel out of the way."
 Already moving with the unearthly speed he normally concealed even from me, Alec hung up the phone and started throwing things into the backpack.
 "Jack's working himself up to a dominance fight with Jess.
 This couldn't have happened at a worse time.
 If we're not back before it starts odds are someone's going to die."

Tom was paralyzed from the waist down in the accident.
 Car washes were held as fundraisers for this handsome and popular young man whose family had no health insurance.
 Tom was always such a bright spot and had an infectious personality.
 As time went on Brandon never stopped being his best friend.
 At sixteen years old Brandon was helping his young friend with everything from carrying him into a car or up the stairs to helping him on the toilet or into a bath.
 They would race down our hallway in the wheelchair laughing and carrying on like nothing was amiss.
 Often Tom’s father called to ask if Brandon could come over to help his son through his darker depressed moments and we would always allow it, no matter what time of the day or night.
 I was so impressed by Brandon’s mature behavior and his unwavering friendship and love for Tom.
 One day Tom’s father called me to thank me for Brandon’s friendship to his son.
 He was emotional when he called as he told me that long after the fundraisers, gatherings and phone calls for his son had stopped, only one friend was still calling and visiting and it was Brandon.

"Could we go to one of them?
 I really should be doing my homework, but I'd much rather just curl up with a good book."
 Donovan picked up the cell phone that I, unsure whether or not it was really mine, had left on the bed, and handed it to me.
 "I believe you'll want to keep this with you at all times.
 Otherwise it won't be able to fulfill its assigned purpose.
 And yes, we can most definitely go to one of the libraries.
 In fact, I believe you'll find the smaller one quite satisfactory.
 It has a copy of every textbook currently in use at your high school, in case you reconsider."
 There were more turns than I had any hope of ever remembering, but eventually we made it to a familiar-looking door.
 At a nod from Donovan I pushed it open, and then as the furnishings registered, I turned back around.

 And, of course, we were too young, but we managed to hang out on the fringes for a while, until we became accepted, through the music, through the music.
 And about the time I would have graduated from high school we got the chance to make that album, what we thought was our big break, our rocket to stardom.

 Marie raised wide eyes to Rick's face as they stood to leave.
 "Was that man who was on fire hurt?"
 "No.
 He'll do another show in a couple of hours."
 "How do they do that?"
 "The jacket is made out of some kind of special material."
 That was the most amazing stunt she saw that day, but there were dozens of special effects and props that filled her with wonder.
 They took a tour of the movie lot, and Marie was excited to see the sets of some of the movies Rick had rented for her.
 The tram they rode crossed a bridge that shook as if it would collapse, and she screamed, clutching Rick's arm.

 When she didn't look away, simply continuing to gaze into his eyes, he slowly lowered his mouth to hers, brushing his lips over hers.
 She didn't pull away.
 Gathering her closer, he kissed her gently.

 The group was waiting for us when we crossed over the ridge, down to the site where we had spent so many days and nights.
 If I hadn’t been so exhausted from lack of sleep, I would have probably been nervous.
 As it was, I blindly followed Ruby as we gathered and eventually mounted to leave.
 Chevelle, Steed, and I were back on our mounts from the earlier leg of the journey.

 Qurrah was too weak to complain, so together they ran down the streets.
 They passed closed homes containing people praying for safety and victory.
 Looming ahead of them was the southern gate.
 Hundreds of soldiers stacked against it, their shields braced and ready.
 All along the walls, archers released arrow after arrow into the darkness.
 “How are we to get closer?” Qurrah asked.
 “Ignore them,” Harruq said.
 “I know what I’m doing.”
 He led them into an alley in between several worn buildings made of stone.

Investment in education and training helped Thailand raise labour productivity by 63 per cent during 1980–5.
 It, too, is moving from a labour surplus to a labour shortage economy.
 An enormous range and depth of physical, technical, organizational, managerial and social skills are needed in order to utilize constructively the freedom which democracy provides, the productive power of new technologies, and the efficiency of modern institutions and systems to achieve greater developmental results.
 These skills admit of constant and continuous improvement without limit, in the same way that technology and organization can always be further improved.
 A comparative survey of the level and quality of skills in any country with those of countries above and below it on scales of economic and human development will reveal the crucial role of skills in development.
 A scale of progression on key skills can help every country identify its relative position, assess the scope for further progress and evolve strategies to fill the gap.
 Raising the skills of society to those of countries higher up on the scale will enable the country to move to that higher level.
 Despite enormous expansion of educational and training institutions, most developing countries suffer from a shortage of quality vocational skills among the huge number of people at lower levels of the society who seek desperately to raise their standard of living.
 This shortage retards the growth in productivity and quality needed to meet domestic needs and achieve international competitiveness.
 The technical training in frastructure in these countries should be expanded by the establishment of craft and vocational training institutes at the local level in every community to impart a wide range of basic technical skills.

Once he'd dug up every painful moment from my childhood, I was going to get to finally start learning about him.
 His pack too of course, but most importantly, I'd finally know more of what made Alec Graves tick.
 A couple of hours later at lunch, Mrs. Campbell had met the appearance of Rachel, Alec, and the rest of the pack with a raised eyebrow and a disbelieving headshake, but simply motioned them all over to the other side of the room, and handed me my test.
 Despite having spent weeks preparing for my makeup exam, I was still a little nervous until I started working the first problem.
 Forty minutes later I handed Mrs. Campbell a completed test, and got the extreme pleasure of watching her grade it and write a large, crimson 'A' on the front page.
 I was so excited I nearly squealed in delight.
 I managed to restrain myself, just barely, only to giggle as Rachel dropped her lunch and squealed for me.
 Dominic's gentle smile wasn't quite as enthusiastic, but I already knew her subdued reaction wasn't any less heartfelt.
 Throw in Jasmin's congratulations, which seemed to indicate the passing grade had been nothing less than inevitable, with Alec taking my hand as soon as I sat down, and Jessica and James' lack of response didn't matter at all.
 With Isaac's reassuring presence at my side in History, I weathered the renewed gossip, apparently occasioned by the entire pack's absence during lunch for the second day in a row, and soon found myself reunited with Alec in Physics.

Decades of freedom and education were needed for the country to outgrow a sense of inferiority, a seeking for security, a feeling of submissiveness and complacency, and to acquire a sense of pride, ambition, high aspirations and expectations, a seeking for achievement, and a spirit of adventure and enterprise – and still the task is not complete.
 Development is like a chemical reaction that is determined by the variety and quantity of elements present and the conditions under which they are put together.
 If one essential element or condition is missing, a social transition like a chemical reaction may not take place at all.
 The absence of peace in war-torn Africa or democratic freedoms in former colonial nations, the absence of social stability or an entrepreneurial class, the absence of a functioning banking or educational system, the absence of the minimum necessary infrastructure for transportation and communication – any one of these may be enough to prevent transition until the deficit is made up.
 If even an inessential element or condition is missing, the process of transition may take much longer than would otherwise be necessary.
 Lack of information, lack of education, lack of necessary skills, lack of supportive laws or incentives or protection against losses – insufficiency in any of these areas may be enough to slow or delay the process of change by years or even decades.
 The world needs a coherent intellectual framework for understanding and dealing with radical transitions.
 High priority should be given to developing a fresh conceptual approach that is not en cumbered by allegiance to existing theories and systems.
 Transitions should be regarded as social transformations which depend on and result in corresponding changes in the political, economic and other spheres.
 Efforts to guide a multi-dimensional social transition through uni-dimensional strategies, particularly those limited to manipulation of macro-economic policy, are unlikely to yield the anticipated results.

I had been born in a castle.
 I sat with the journal for a long moment.
 There was no way to reconcile this information with my own thoughts, no way to fill in what the bonds had taken.
 It hurt to read this, but there was no not finishing it.
 I decided the only way to keep going was if I did it as I had before I’d known it was my mother, as if I were an uninvolved reader.

Just feeling a little run down.
 I'll spend the whole weekend lying around reading and studying.
 That should fix me right up."
 I gave Mom a wan smile, exactly the kind I used when I was really sick, and helped her finish packing.
 I wasn't sure whether I helped because I was feeling guilty, or because I was worried Brandon would show up before she'd left.
 Maybe I was just hoping to kill two birds with one stone.
 It wasn't until she was finally in the Jeep and backing down our lane that I finally stopped worrying that Brandon was going to pop around the corner.
 He'd been smugly confident he wouldn't show up before she was gone, but had refused to tell me how he planned on pulling up at my house five minutes after the coast was clear.
 Half of me was strongly tempted to dawdle for fifteen or twenty minutes, but with my luck he'd really manage to show up within the next few minutes, and I'd have to scramble to get ready while he waited for me.
 With a sigh I ran up to the bathroom, brushed my teeth, gave my hair the once-over, and grabbed a light jacket as I left my room.

But people did not question the order of the sorcerer and master of Raven Keep, so it should work.
 He dared not stay longer than he had to; Rodregas did not believe that he could fool Ravenhurr’s guards and servants for long.
 Ravenhurr was a powerful sorcerer who used magic quite casually; it would become quite obvious that Rodregas did not know how to use magic anywhere near Ravenhurr’s level.
 As soon as the keep emptied out for the birthday celebration he would make his escape.
 If he missed this opportunity he was not sure when he could try again.
 It was very rare for an Immortalist to leave his tower, and if he were behaving oddly, the guild would send someone to check on him soon.
 They were careful in their control of the kingdom.
 For a while Rodregas just leaned against the cold stone wall.
 Not thinking of anything, there was too much to think about to even start.
 So instead of thinking he simply felt the cool stone wall and it slowly, truly, hit him.

 Harruq and Qurrah waited anxiously at their door.
 They were fully armed and ready.
 The half-orc’s sister swords were sharpened and gleaming.
 Wrapped around his arm, Qurrah’s whip writhed hungrily.
 Their eyes rarely blinked, but as hour after hour passed and no blanket of shadow came to them, their patience wore thin.
 “The human army is right outside the town,” Harruq grumbled.

You'd need red and all of the other colors to generate a true white light."
 It was obvious we were on the wrong track here.
 "What about some other mechanism?
 One that wouldn't just make water glow with a dancing gold light, but plants too.
 Do you know of anything like that?"
 I heard something snap off to my right, but I was too busy blushing from the chorus of giggles coming from the front of the classroom.
 Even Mrs. Alexander had an amused smile on her kind face.
 "While there are certain types of vegetation that do indeed glow, I'm afraid I don't know of any natural phenomenon that would create the kind of effect you're referring to.
 Such a thing is still the provenance of science fiction writers."
 I knew I'd gotten a little carried away.

The heart of the Shema, Deuteronomy 6:5, commands Israel to: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.” Jesus agrees, in Matthew 22: "’Teacher,’ a disciple asks,  ‘which is the greatest commandment in the Law?’ Jesus replies: 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.
 This is the first and greatest commandment.’” The word "love" has dozens of meanings, and the one that rings truest to me involves action and will rather than feeling.
 In M. Scott Peck’s definition, "Love is the willingness to sacrifice for the sake of someone else's spiritual growth."
 Since God hardly needs spiritual growth, let’s define loving God as the willingness to sacrifice when God calls us to.
 And at the very least, he calls us to obey his commandments.
 Meaning we face yet another problem.
 In churches that preach seeking relationship rather than religion, we're told that lacking a relationship with God, we’ll have at best a heck of a time trying to obey.
 And I have seen no reason to doubt that assessment.
 But if the call to relationship implies we should adore, I confess that truth has escaped me until now.
 I mean, we all know it's possible to have a relationship with someone we don't adore.

Think of it, with your magic, we will be able to conquer anything.
 Whatever we need, whatever we want, it will be nothing but a flick of your wrist.” I froze.
 It was irrational, I knew, but anger seethed.
 I couldn’t stop myself from thinking he was just like everyone else, interested only in my powers.
 My magic.
 And how it would benefit him.
 I turned to him, glaring, and he drew back, startled.
 “Is that what you want, why you are so intent on marrying me?
 For my power?” He shook his head, mystified.
 The rage had overtaken me, though.

 So I’d killed a bird, stolen a few papers from the council library.
 My argument faltered, so I went back to anger, betrayal that he had lied to me.
 And not just him.
 The entire village must have known I was bound, known I couldn’t perform magic, as they sat and watched me try.
 Sending me to Junnie for lessons, allowing Evelyn to taunt me without recourse, giving me the blame for everything that happened.
 Because they expected me to turn.

 It turned her words into my nightmares.
 Watchers and trackers, tassels and robes, Chevelle’s furious gaze as he pushed me from the cliff again.

 The broad range of topics examined by the International Commission on Peace and Food demonstrates the interrelated nature of the challenges of peace and development.
 Your collective endeavour illustrates the fact that no longer can global peace and security remain the preserve of political and military specialists.
 Without an adequate development effort, there can be no lasting peace and security.
 Conflicts over resources, ultra-nationalism exacerbated by the tensions of unemployment, poverty and despair at home will inevitably lead to resentment, and resentment turns only too easily into armed conflict.
 The establishment of secure foundations for peace will be aided by development and post-conflict peace building.
 Yet if there is a growing international consensus on the peace operations undertaken by the United Nations, there is no such consensus on its developmental work.

She had called a friend who told her she could get her into this bar because she knew the bartender and they were both under legal drinking age.
 Lisa was 20.
 She was a “good girl” and hadn’t ever done anything like that.
 She had no intention of breaking up with her boyfriend.
 I looked her square in her beautiful blue eyes and I told her flatly, “You are going to fall so in love with me that you will not even remember this guy’s name!” We were married three years later.
 After all the years we have been married, I still think of that moment I saw her walk into that bar whenever we are having a tough time.
 It puts all my love right back where it belongs and nothing else matters.

 Suffice it to say only Dominic has a greater capacity for empathy."
 I wanted to ask what Alec meant, but it was more and more obvious he wasn't going to answer anything he didn't want to.
 We walked in comfortable silence for several minutes before turning off into what I could only assume was the Lilac Room.
 Donovan looked up as we entered the suite.
 "I trust your mother was well, sir?"
 Alec nodded, a short choppy motion that eloquently conveyed his desire not to discuss the matter.
 He turned towards me, only to break off as a cell phone rang.
 "It's for you, probably your mom.
 Pretend you're home, I'll explain once you're finished."

I'd almost backed out when Alec told me we'd be taking his bullet bike, but I didn't want him to know I really was a complete wuss.
 All of which explained how I'd ended up on Alec's shiny, blue Yamaha R1 with my arms locked around him in a death grip.
 Apparently I'd given away at least some of my fear though, because Alec took the first half of our forty-minute drive at a positively sedate pace, or at least what qualified as a sedate pace on a machine that could go from zero to sixty much faster than any of the exotic sports cars Alec and his friends usually drove.
 Just as I finally started to enjoy leaning with Alec while zipping around turns at what I was starting to suspect were triple digit speeds, he pulled off behind a ramshackle, old building and held a finger to his lips.
 I held my breath and tried my best to try and figure out what he was listening for, but encased as I was by the blue helmet he'd insisted on, I would've been lucky to notice if a herd of elephants had been hot on our trail.
 Several seconds passed, and then Alec smiled at me again and backed the bike into the building, which was every bit as decrepit-looking on the inside as it'd been on the outside.
 "Are we here?"
 "Disappointed?"
 I felt my skin heat up again, but managed to stick my tongue out.
 "No, we're not quite there yet, but before we continue on, I need your promise not to discuss this with anyone.

Confusion again as Junnie followed after him.
 Chased him.
 Ruby’s whip cracked in front of me and I knew the advance had gotten too far.
 And I was tied to a wall.
 Why hadn’t they killed me already?
 I waited for the flames.
 What came instead was far more excruciating.
 I expected to collapse as my body disconnected from my mind, but the vines held me in place.
 I saw a few final flickers of the battle before my eyes looked toward the sky, rolling back into my head.
 I had no way of forming a coherent thought or I might have been afraid.

My wavering vision was just up to making out the outline of Rachel's present where I'd left it on the table.
 Feeling incredibly ungrateful and thoughtless, I limped over to the table and tore open the delicate wrapping paper.
 It was a copy of the latest Les Misérables movie, complete with the score from the most recent Broadway production, and a signed picture of the entire cast.
 Mom still wasn't home by the time it got dark, but I went to bed truly happy for the first time in ages.

 My train of thought shattered as I got my first glimpse of the interior of what'd become my own personal Mecca.

"Isn't that odd?

 He was debating whether or not to lie to me.

 "Don't lie to me."
 Alec sighed, and then shrugged.
 "I'm not sure what to tell you.

 More importantly, you're better off not knowing."

 This time when he pushed her shoulder she went back but did not stumble.

The necromancer stepped outside his home, walked to the side, and stared at the flickering lights in the distance.
 Campfires and torches.
 An army, the same that had removed him and his brother from their home, slept so close.
 Every one of them contemplated their death.
 Qurrah closed his eyes and inhaled the cold night air.
 Yes, the tension was delectable.
 The quiet moments before battle were a rare thing that so very few were lucky enough to experience.
 Fear, worry, hope, prayer, regret, and sorrow all floated to the stars.

A plan should be adopted at the forthcoming UN Social Summit for establishing model district programmes in Eastern and Central European countries.
 Plans for transition should cover all of the factors listed above, providing trained personnel to assist in the establishment and initial operation of new institutions and systems.
 7.Plan for institutional development: An assessment of the type and functioning of existing institutions and economic systems should be compiled to identify missing links that need to be provided to support the transition.
 Based on this study, a master plan should be drawn up for establishing the necessary institutions and systems in each country.
 In order to prepare a cadre of managers for private sector industry and institutions, specialized institutes of management should be set up in each country.
 8.Launch a massive programme to impart new skills and attitudes to the population: In countries where private enterprise was extinguished for decades, entrepreneurial, financial and marketing skills can be extremely limited.
 An analysis should be undertaken of the types and levels of skills needed for transition to a market system, covering areas such as entrepreneurship, management, national and international marketing, strategic business planning, finance, quality control, product development, production technology, design, and human resource development.
 Experience in former colonial nations where entrepreneur ship was also stifled for a long period indicates that a profound change in attitude is necessary before people will risk leaving or forego seeking salaried and pensioned jobs in favour of self-employment, even when the salaried jobs are scarce or unavailable.
 Such a basic change of attitude, which normally requires a change of generation, can be accelerated by a massive programme of public information, education and demonstration spanning several years.
 9.Study the benefits of economic recovery on world trade: Recessionary trends are affecting many parts of the world today.

Jim – Uhh…Not really, we were just discussing who would win in an all out fight, a gang of angry circus midgets wielding pointed sticks, or the seven dwarves after they find out that Snow White is missing.
 Liz – Ah yeah, yes, that’s it.
 Ten Midgets didja say?
 I’m going with the angry gang of midgets wielding the pointed sticks they have the numbers and pointed sticks.
 Jim – There doesn’t need to be a lot of dwarves, just one of them is worth like 3 midgets, pointed sticks or no pointed sticks.
 What they lack in quantity they make up in quality.
 I mean these guys are huge and muscular, at least from a midget’s perspective, and they have those pick-axes they use around the mine.
 The seven dwarves would win hands down.
 Liz – you’re forgetting that the dwarves have just come home after a long day’s work in the mines.
 They’re exhausted, they’re not looking for a fight.

I smiled, kicking my heels hard into the horse’s sides.
 The animal jolted forward.
 I gripped the saddle with all my might as its hooves cut the earth.
 I’d never ridden a horse.
 There weren’t any near the village and I’d only ever seen one from the occasional visitor.
 This beast was huge and I could feel his power as the ground rushed beneath us.
 We were gaining on Steed as I glanced over my shoulder to find Chevelle, his horse running, but not with the same determination as mine.
 Wind whipped my hair as we caught Steed, who gave me a wide smile and edged beside us.
 “Enjoying the beast?” I smiled in return, but as the horse kept up speed, we started to pass him, and I realized I didn’t know how to slow down.
 I didn’t know how to stop.

No images flickered behind my lids, yet my eyes did not open.
 The muffle in my ears from the drowning dreams was gone.
 I could hear clearly, clearer than I’d ever heard.
 I hadn’t found my body yet, but I heard conversations, voices I knew.
 They were whispers but they were clear.
 I listened, hoping to gain clarity… but something was still wrong.
 Nothing fit.
 They discussed Junnie and Anvil and Fannie, but those all felt like two sets of people now.
 They were worried; I could hear the stress in their tones.
 How long had I been like this?

As Rodregas knelt on the ground balancing the sword across his arms, and the sun warm on his face, he thought back to that time when he had used his Squire title to get into the officer academy in the Ramig Empire.
 Though giving up his dream of becoming a Knight of the Soaring Heavens had been hard, Rodregas had thought that he would become a successful officer in the army.
 Unfortunately, things had gone far amiss and he had never known success.
 Rodregas shook his head.
 He was focusing on the distant past, not his duty.
 That is what this meditation was all about, so what was his duty now?
 Killing Immortalists was not something that he, or even the three of them together, could just start doing.
 The problem was not just the individual Immortalist; many an angry town would have killed the local Immortalist Sorcerer after having their people taken.
 Anyone that struck back at an individual Immortalist would face the wrath of the Guild of the Celestial Path, which included not just the god-like power of the Guild Master and his various sorcerers, but also the army of the Guild known as The Immortal Guards.
 While not a large army, they were the most feared warriors in the world.

I flipped through more of the pages, realizing something was out of place.
 It didn’t make sense official documents about Fannie would be among those relating to the apparent extinction of the northern clans.
 And why had all the documents I’d found about the tragedy been separated, mixed up, and missing pages?
 I tried to sort it out, but found there were other council documents there too.
 I kept reading, quickly scanning for something of interest.
 My eyes caught on his name a second before my mind recognized it… Chevelle Vattier.
 As I backed up to read, my shock and disbelief turned to fury before I could even finish the page.
 Chevelle Vattier had been a volunteer watcher.
 A Council spy.
 He had volunteered to watch me.

Make it stop, make it stop… Seth gave me a comforting squeeze but it didn’t help.
 I tried to think of something else, like penguins or llamas.
 Anything, I didn’t care what I thought about, it could be underwear, as long as I wasn’t thinking about what was actually happening to me right now.
 Llamas, I thought urgently.
 Llamas are furry and they spit at you when they’re mad.
 They’re the joke of most middle school kids, they’re tall…I think.
 You can see them at parks or zoos.

Then the man was gone, vanishing into the shadows of the room.
 The two glanced at each other.
 Harruq shrugged.
 “That was easy.
 Bed time?”
 “Sleep if you must,” Qurrah said.
 “I will join you in a bit.”
 Harruq removed his armor, lay down on the bed of straw, and slept.
 The necromancer stepped outside his home, walked to the side, and stared at the flickering lights in the distance.

As I peered through the gap in the doorframe, the stranger’s eyes flicked to mine and I was sure she somehow saw me.
 I held my breath and jerked away from view, plastering myself against the wall.
 When she didn’t speak up to expose me, my pulse began to slow.
 But I wasn’t brave enough to look again.
 I stared into the room, the space relatively large and ornate compared to my bedroom at home.
 There was a stone-framed bed wide enough for two, dark olive blankets in layers on top.
 A side table held a few trinkets and a decanter set, and there was a hickorywood wardrobe in the corner.
 A full mirror lined the east wall.
 I took a few steps forward, staring in disbelief as my figure came into view.
 I had seen the reflection in the water, had known my hair was dark, my eyes a strange shade of green.

I pulled my feet up on the couch, leaned back against the arm and rested my Spanish book on my knees.
 I momentarily wondered if I should make myself quite so comfortable as my eyes closed.
 The doorbell came as an abrupt surprise, waking me from the nap I hadn't intended on taking.
 I'd been in one of the surreal, vivid dreams.
 It was already too distant to remember details, but I had the impression of being on a mountaintop during the day with vision so acute that I'd been able to see the individual motes of dust.
 Oddly enough it almost seemed like Alec had been there too.
 The person waiting outside wasn't anyone I recognized, but he had the cultured, high-brow appearance of someone who was either really rich, or who moved in the kind of circles where you didn't get seated unless you were properly attired.
 "Why, hello, you must be Adriana.
 Can I call you Adri?"
 I shook my head.

We should be there by nightfall.” “Not bad,” said Imeralda.
 “Sounds like a place that will be hard to find, but is this not territory infested with wild Dire beast?” “Yup,” Rodregas said, “another reason I think this area is usually hard to find; most people stay clear.” He continued after a pause to let them think of entering territory known to be the hunting range of feared predators, “I never saw any sign of any Dire beast in the hollows when I was there, but, of course, they probably know of the place.
 Still, I would rather handle a pack of Hellhounds than The Immortal Guards.” Neither looked pleased at his logic, but both nodded.
 A few hours later it was starting to get dark as Rodregas recognized the spot and turned the wagon left for the final hard assent.
 At this point there was no trail, and common sense would have argued against the path.
 It was hard work.
 The horses had to be hand-led around rocks and trees and pulled up.
 Doi’van and Rodregas had to manhandle the wagon around a few corners which was easier to do than it should have been, but Celestial and Hellborn strength together made short work of it.
 Then, as they finally started to level out into the small little valley of the hollow, the hair all over Rodregas’ body suddenly stood up on end and his skin shivered.
 Rodregas was expecting it, but was a little shocked by the strength of his reaction.

I hadn't consciously planned it when I went to bed, but circumstances were perfect.
 If I was wrong, Mom was not only home, judging by the noises filtering down the stairs, she was awake and only a few minutes away from coming downstairs.
 Even filled with the near certainty that Brandon's parents, and by extension him, were our secret benefactors, the next fifteen minutes were some of the longest in my life.
 When Brandon's Mustang finally appeared around the bend in the lane, I found myself smiling so hard my face was starting to hurt.
 Breathing silent but heartfelt thanks that Mom was in the shower and therefore couldn't hear the low rumble of the Mustang's engine, I slipped out the front door and skipped down the concrete steps.
 "I figured you were either too sick to get out of bed, or you finally decided to trust me."
 Brandon's gray eyes twinkled as he made a show of checking me over.
 "Looks like you're not sick."
 I didn't know it was possible to blush and smile at the same time.
 "Nope, not sick."

“Why would I?”
 “Children have been dying since you arrived here in Woodhaven,” Dieredon replied.
 “Butchered, intestines removed, strange carvings on the bodies, and pieces of them missing.
 We thought a sick mind, but now I understand better.
 Necromancy requires many interesting artifacts for spells.
 Your brother is a necromancer, isn’t he?”
 Harruq said nothing.
 He fought back his swelling anger and panic.
 “I don’t understand what Aurelia sees in you,” Dieredon continued.

Every social condition is the result of current social values, attitudes and policies.
 The values, attitudes and policies underlying the present state of the US economy give highest priority to conserving the value of existing wealth, rather than creating new wealth through faster economic growth and higher rates of employment.
 The apparent obsession of central bankers supported by international financial institutions to raise interest rates in anticipation of rising prices, thereby sacrificing job growth in order to prevent even modest levels of inflation, illustrates negatively to what extent it is human choices – based on superstitious fear and a clinging to money value at the expense of human value – that prevent us from resolving this crucial problem.
 The current level of unemployment is one among several of its natural results.
 People’s jobs are a variable being manipulated in the operation of economic policy.
 Through its acceptance of government policy, society has chosen the present system and, if it chooses, can alter it in preference for another.
 The commitment to ‘jobs for all’ is also undermined by the false impression that the total employment available in society is inherently limited by the finite, material needs of the community.
 Modern economic history is witness to an ever-expanding growth in human needs to match the ever-increasing productive capacities of the post-industrial age.
 Creating more jobs is an expansive movement that generates more purchasing power, increases aggregate demand and consumption, stimulates further job creation, and moves the whole economy towards higher rates of growth.
 The expansion is not merely horizontal.

Mr. Whethers unknowingly helped my cause, when he crossly silenced a couple of girls on the far side of the classroom.
 He was normally so even-tempered that even his moderate rebuke instantly shut them up.
 I probably shouldn't have felt quite so happy about it, but I was pretty sure from the way they'd been looking at me that I'd been the source of their gossip.
 When the bell finally released us, I couldn't avoid Britney any longer.
 "Adri...ana, why didn't you tell me?"
 I didn't answer for several seconds, not sure I'd actually heard her right.
 "Tell you what?"
 "Fine, play coy.
 I just think you should know it's pretty lame for me to find all that stuff out second hand.
 We're best friends; you should totally have trusted me enough to tell me."

I'll bet there are plenty of other people who'd be interested too.
 Maybe I can start a club at school."
 It was like someone else was doing the talking for me.
 I'd never been this bold, and to do so now with someone who could arrange for my mom's job to disappear again seemed like the worst kind of stupidity, but I couldn't fall apart now.
 I almost couldn't believe my eyes when his face turned red.
 "Listen here, Missy.
 I've been in politics longer than you've been alive, and it takes a whole hell of a lot more than a precocious teenager to blackmail me.
 So, you can just drop your veiled threats and pretend like we never had this conversation, or I will see that your mom is once again unemployed, and we'll just see whether or not your protector is bluffing."
 Stepping out of my front door and being hit by a cement truck would have been less of a surprise.
 I'd thought something odd was happening, but the idea of someone protecting us was almost unbelievable.

Boys who didn't behave much at all like any other popular kids I'd ever known.
 Alec hated me, Brandon stopped by to give me a ride to school every day, and neither of them should have even realized I was alive.
 If I couldn't be at home, couldn't the universe have at least arranged for me to get involved with a nice, normal, uncomplicated, plain-looking boy, or barring that to remain safely uninterested in boys altogether?
 At the very least, someone out there should have managed to keep the air conditioning working.
 By the time English ended, I felt worse, albeit for different reasons than earlier in Biology.
 Luckily, Algebra was starting to become a real sanctuary.
 The fact that we had a test made everyone even more focused than normal.
 Considering how on-task and busy Mrs. Campbell normally kept the class that was a feat in and of itself.
 I scanned through the first problem, and then picked up my pencil and got started.
 Having successfully finished my test with ten minutes to spare, I expected lunch to bring more of the same kind of anxiety that I'd just managed to push out of my mind.

The water was cooling, so she rapidly bathed, washed her clothes, and stepped out of the tub.
 The bath towel was big and fluffy and felt wonderful against her skin.
 She looked askance at the night shirt, however.
 She'd never worn such a thing.
 When she put it on, she found that it fit her like a tent.
 But oddly enough, she liked it.
 The big bathrobe almost reached her ankles, and she felt quite comfortable as she picked up her dress and wet clothing and went across the hall to the bedroom.
 She found hangers in the closet and hung her clothes there.
 But once she was in bed, the dreamlike feeling dissolved.
 She was far, far away from home, in a strange place, and she didn't know if she'd ever get back.

I doubted she had enough grip strength to slow even me down.
 "Don't be angry with me, Alec.

 "I'm not angry, Mother, but you're wrong.

 She shook her head with a youthful smile.
 "Such a good boy."
 Rachel, tears coursing down her face, stormed off as Alec pulled his mother's door shut behind us.
 I started to follow her, but Alec recaptured my hand in his.
 "She just needs a little time.

Casting magic would also be a great risk.
 They only needed to close the distance and Qurrah was theirs.
 However, knowing was easier than doing.
 Much easier.
 When the two tried to close in, Qurrah lashed out with his whip.
 One ducked away in fear.
 The other managed to deflect the lash and then charge, his sword leading.
 The flaming leather curled back around like a living thing.
 Qurrah sent it at the nearest opponent.
 He blocked, and then realized blocking was what the whip wanted him to do.

I was tired of always having to make everyone spell things out for me.
 “No council ever.
 No rulers… anymore?
 So what then?” Steed flinched at my tone, but didn’t answer.
 “Frey,” Chevelle called from the front of the line.
 I glared at him.
 “Time to resume your training.” They had me work with Anvil, trying to anticipate when he was preparing to send a small current of electricity toward me.
 Which meant I spent the day getting shocked.
 I was grateful when we finally stopped to make camp.
 I was afraid they would resume training after dinner, so I found a place off by myself and pretended to rest as I went back to reading the diary.

She kissed Marie's forehead and left.
 Marie curled up next to Rick's t-shirt still clutching his handkerchief.
 She felt so empty.
 She didn't sleep well that night but woke up early nevertheless.
 After bathing, she put on her emerald underwear and a simple white dress and went out into the garden.
 It didn't look so different from Rick's, she decided.
 They didn't have any white roses like he did, nor an electric fountain, but they had red roses and azaleas, just as he did.
 She wished she'd brought back a picture of him.
 But a picture wouldn't help much, she knew.
 She wanted to be in his arms, kiss him, touch him.

Marie, not noticing any difference in his stare, smiled as she handed him the bottle.
 "Will you put some on my back?"
 She stretched out on her stomach.
 He ran his hands up and down and around her back, massaging and caressing.
 Her skin was so soft.
 He dropped a kiss onto her shoulder.
 "Does that feel good?"
 "Mmm," she murmured sleepily.
 Moving her hair aside, he kissed the nape of her neck.
 Then he moved down, slowly pressing kisses along the length of her spine.

One late afternoon as I sat on the grass at the University of San Diego, overlooking the harbor and wondering how I could fix my emotions, I mumbled, “Okay, where should I start?” Then I remembered advice Master Jeong, our Tae Kwon Do instructor, often gave.
 He told us, "Everything begins with the spirit.
 From the spirit come the thoughts.
 From the thoughts come the actions.
 From the actions come the habits.
 From the habits comes the character.
 And from the character comes the destiny.” Stupefied by stress as I was, I sat a while wondering where on that continuum I should start trouble-shooting, until the obvious made itself clear.
 Start with the spirit.
 So, I thought, what could best set my spirit on the right path?
 I believe it was God who sent the message: "Look here, you're a writer.

Chevelle was gone.
 “Are you well?” “Ugh.” He snickered.
 “Come on.” He swept me up, planning to carry me.
 My head spun.
 “No.
 Please let me walk.” “You do not tolerate that stuff well.
 You’re going to have to lay off the shimmer.” “It’s not like I chose to take it,” I complained.
 He laughed.
 The cold air helped a little.
 I was back in the circle, the group of us sitting around a small fire.

She lived in 1927.
 She was going back.
 Then she'd be able to talk to her mother about any confusing feelings that might linger.
 She put on her Egyptian-motif dress, her ugly black shoes, and even her 1927 underwear.
 Rick, thankfully, was in his own shower when she went downstairs and out to the garden.
 She didn't really think she'd be able to get back on a clear, bright afternoon, but she needed to put herself closer, emotionally at least, to home.
 "Marie?"
 Rick called as he searched the house for her.
 She wasn't in the living room or kitchen.
 He went upstairs and looked in her bedroom.

I was sure they were waiting for something.
 “Well, it’s just that I remember reading in the village about castles in the North.” Was I supposed to have read that?
 Had that been in the documents I had pilfered from the library?
 Shut up, Frey, shut up!
 They seemed to relax a little as Chevelle shook his head and brought his horse back to pace.
 I thought I knew what they were thinking.
 Idiot.
 Ruby answered, “Hmm,” with a cocked eyebrow as she turned to follow the group.
 They were mostly silent the rest of the day, until we stopped for the night.
 The group split after dinner as Anvil and Grey positioned themselves on rocks at the perimeter of our camp.

It was the color of wet leaves.
 Many windows decorated the front, all covered with silken curtains.
 The fence surrounded the entire property, black iron spiked ten feet at the top.
 “How do we get in?” Harruq asked.
 Qurrah examined the fence, his face locked in a frown.
 “I don’t know.
 I have no spells that can aid us.”
 The bigger half-orc stood and stretched his muscles.
 “Well, up to me then.” He took out Condemnation, grinning as the soft red glow lit up his face.
 “Let’s see how strong this girl is.”

“It is seven against two, you stupid pigs,” he shouted.
 “What are you thinking?”
 “That you will die last,” Qurrah said before casting his first spell.
 The fire in the center of the camp flickered and then died.
 The half-orcs, through their mixed blood, could see well in the darkness.
 The humans had no such natural ability.
 Until their eyes adjusted to the moonlight, the only thing they could see was their burning red eyes, the demonic glow of Harruq’s blades, and the fire that burned but did not consume Qurrah’s whip.
 In that darkness, they were demons of another plane, furious and merciless.
 The men fought but their hearts were afraid.
 Qurrah could sense it and knew the battle was already theirs.

She agreed and said she would see me soon.
 After I hung up the phone, the officer called me on my personal cell phone, which I was answering from a headset in my ear.
 He offered some encouraging words about how I had handled her attempt to move me and said they would try to move me again because Steve was not going to want to meet me in this county because of his arrangement with the police here.
 We were only a mile from another county line so Officer White and his team felt he would try to get me to move that mile.
 I hung up and the wait began.
 I was all eyes and all ears as the silence in the truck made it too easy for my mind to wander.
 I wasn’t allowed any background noise.
 I was parked at the far end of the lot with the front end of my truck against a fence as I was instructed to do.
 I was impatiently waiting when I finally saw one of the scraggly dressed officers wandered by pushing a grocery basket full of bags looking like a homeless person.
 He had an old torn jacket on with a beanie on his head.

 "Rick," she began at last, "do you remember when you first kissed me?"
 "With perfect clarity."
 He grinned at her.

“Are you trying to kill me?” she asked, “and are you really trying to rescue a Forest Nymph from a tree?” The laughter that followed was pure and open and even he had to laugh with it.
 “So,” he asked, “what are you doing?” “Well, I decided that if this was a greater sigil I should touch it.
 Even though I do not want a greater sigil to consume my magic, this is the One Tree.
 And well, I am a Nymph.
 So I reached out and touched the tree and nothing happened.
 But trees speak to me.
 Speaking to the One Tree was wonderful; the One Tree is here and not here.
 Somehow it can be reached from here I think is the best way to describe it.
 But there is no sigil to be had.
 The tree ‘spoke’ to me as trees do, and it explained about the ‘Blessing of the One Tree,’ that is probably why it was here like the greater sigils.” Imeralda spoke in a conversational tone but also like she was amazed by her own story.

According to current projections, 300 million people, representing nearly 50 per cent of the population of sub-Saharan Africa, will live below the poverty line at the turn of the century.
 Environment: Unsustainable lifestyles and consumption (in industrial countries) and population growth, along with rising levels of production and consumption (in developing countries), will place strenuous demands on the environment of the planet.
 Growing damage to the basic life support systems of soil, water, flora, fauna and the atmosphere is taking place in all parts of the world.
 Unemployment: In the West, rising levels of unemployment have increased resistance to free trade and immigration.
 Rising levels of long-term unemployment and youth unemployment in inner cities are associated with the increasing incidence of crime.
 In developing countries, rapid population growth continues to outpace job creation in most regions, resulting in high levels of unemployment, increasing social unrest and large scale migration from rural to urban areas and internationally.
 Gender discrimination: Gender remains a major determinant of privilege and discrimination worldwide.
 Women still suffer from unfavourable sex ratios, lower wages and restraints on property owner ship, as well as higher levels of illiteracy and lower educational attainments.
 Rising violence: Violence is on the increase, especially violence within society in the form of civil wars, crime and drugs.
 During the first half of 1994, 36 armed conflicts were in progress.

The importance of continuous investment in training is not fully understood by all but the most advanced corporations.
 There is considerable scope for increasing awareness in areas such as self-employment opportunities, the linkage between education and career development, management practices, and foreign trade opportunities.
 Ignorance and superstition concerning drugs, crime, ethnic and race relations, the environment, health, education, child care, and the life of the elderly demoralize the population and make effective socialaction difficult in these areas.
 These problems can be minimized by educating the public to understand the changes taking place and to adopt appropriate new behaviours.
 Raising awareness internationally
 Public opinion is an even more important determinant at the international level, since the authority of global institutions is still quite limited.
 Rising ethnic and nationalistic sentiments threaten the integrity of states and impede progress toward regional cooperation and global governance in many countries, because their populations lack reliable information regarding the enormous costs of political and economic fragmentation.
 The global debate over the Uruguay Round of GATT has been obscured by lack of clear information regarding its impact on the countries involved.
 International negotiations on debt, aid and the environment are complicated by lack of awareness about the opportunities that greater economic integration will generate for all nations.
 International institutions, non-governmental agencies and the international media play an important role in providing information to the world community, but there are still huge gaps to be filled in all fields.

And they were worried about my stupid binding?
 The circling cloaks from my dreams were back, filling my head.
 My thoughts were twisting, getting out of control.
 They’d be hunting us all down now.
 They would kill us.
 That was why I needed training.
 To protect myself.
 Because they intended to kill me, not capture.
 They intended to kill us all.
 And without magic, bound as I was, I didn’t stand a chance.

In first grade, she had decided to become a teacher.
 Over thirteen years, K-8, she missed only two days of school, and those were unavoidable.
 Her Christian school was showing an early film version of Tim LeHay’s Left Behind saga, and Pam couldn’t bear the sight of nice enough pastors getting left behind.
 She won an academic scholarship to Pepperdine University and worked her way through two Masters degrees.
 But to teach where she wanted to go, she needed a PhD.
 A baby might stand in the way of her career, she believed, and I couldn’t argue.
 Besides, with a little good fortune and without the cost of another dependent, as soon as Darcy and Cody finished college I could take early retirement from my day job and devote myself to writing, which had been my dream for too many years.
 I longed for the freedom to run off for weeks at a time to some hermitage where I could think better and write with deeper concentration.
 I harbored a suspicion that my writing career has always been stopped at the edge of a breakthrough by distracting worries, usually about family and finances.
 Most of all, I wanted to feel our marriage was, if not secure, then solid.

I peered through slitted eyes to see Chevelle standing outside the entrance, back to me as he watched a dull red horizon.
 I sat up, lacing the vest over the thin material of my blouse, and slid on my shoes to join him.
 “It’s dawn,” I complained.
 “And good morning, sunshine,” Steed called from atop a large, black stallion.
 The beast’s nostrils flared, breath steaming in the cool morning air.
 Two more of the animals pawed in the distance behind him.
 Steed chirped a whistle and they walked forward, the slim, muscular one moving to stand beside Chevelle as a mammoth crossed in front of me and knelt.
 I drew in a startled breath at the sheer size and nearness of it.
 Steed shot me a mischievous wink.
 “Well?” I was speechless, mouth agape.

 You really got to stop asking that question.” He started to hike the hill.
 “We‘re trying to find out.” I walked up behind him, my leg muscles cramping.
 When we got to the top, I fell on my knees and breathed heavily.
 Seth looked over his shoulder, his eyes twinkling in amusement.
 “Am I too fast for you, Jazell?” “No way,” I huffed.
 “I just need to catch my breath.” I stood up and looked around.
 The hill was pretty high and I could see better.
 The land was hill after hill, tree after tree.

God and everybody.
 Me v. God
 As it appears I’m too attached to the world to live for and with God like Brother Lawrence did, I try to console myself by thinking of one of my favorite writers, Andre Dubus.
 In “A Father’s Story”, he tells about Luke, a horse breeder who attempts to live in God’s will yet finds himself needing to choose between what he believes is right in God’s eyes and his daughter’s well-being.
 He chooses for the daughter.
 I confess to finding myself more sympathetic with Luke than with the patriarch Abraham.
 Soren Kierkegaard calls Abraham the Knight of Faith, a fellow so sure of God that even the idea of questioning a command to murder his own son was unthinkable.
 Good for him.
 Honest.
 Luke the horse breeder, I can admire, and Eric I can adore, in part because I know their flaws, their humanity.

 She loved the way they felt and ran into the parking lot ahead of him, bouncing in them.
 "What'll we do now?"
 she asked as they walked into his house.

Examination of the rising problem of unemployment in industrial nations led us to the formulation of a comprehensive strategy for full employment in the West.
 The Commission's fourth plenary meeting in Oslo during September 1992 focused on the issues of employment and transition.
 Our effort to examine each of these problems, both in depth and in relation to each other, was aided by the constitution of six working groups to study a wide gamut of issues related to peace, disarmament, food, employment and human development in the emerging global context.
 This report is based upon the findings and recommendations of these groups, which were presented and discussed during the fifth and final plenary meeting at the Carter Presidential Center in Atlanta in October 1993.
 This narrative of ICPF's brief history illustrates the complex array of interrelationships that link the issues of peace, social stability, disarmament, democracy and environment with economic transition in the East, employment in the West and poverty elimination and population stabilization in developing countries.
 The necessity for understanding and addressing these issues as a complex whole rather than as disparate and independent parts has been an underlying principle of our work.
 From the outset, it has been our intention to build upon the work of previous international commissions that have done so much to generate greater public awareness and support for coordinated global action.
 This report contains specific operational strategies for implementing many of their recommendations.
 Much of their work can come to fruition in the changed international climate, if only we shift the emphasis from preoccupation with cataloguing the problems to focusing on the opportunities available to eliminate them.
 The work of an independent, self-constituted commission has the advantage of being unfettered by the necessity of conforming to any official policy lines.

 She squinted closer and saw that Jazell had tried to make the line some sort of sword but epically failed.
 Emily showed Jason and he nodded.
 “That’s what I thought.
 Now we have to figure out what it means.” Emily walked up to the edge of the hole and looked down.
 “I have a feeling that we have to go down there.” Jason sighed.
 “I guess we’re jumping down.” “Why would we do that?” “Because,” he said and sat on the side, “we don’t have a rope.” Then he jumped.

But maybe not.
 By that Sunday morning when he showed up at Kenny Niedermeyer's, he might have gotten the whole message.
 I think about standing outside the basketball gym a month before his last day, when Eric could easily have run like he insisted Billy and I do.
 But he said “I’m going to stay and take my punishment.” “For what?” I asked, and he didn’t answer.
 For what?
 I still want to know.
 A favorite mystery writer of mine, Ross McDonald, earned this praise from a reviewer: “McDonald doesn’t write about crime.
 He writes about sin.” I think back to the day I spent asking kids whether they often felt guilty about something but had no idea what it was.

 Right?
 So, to try and instill in it some of the eternal verities, well, it seems pretentious.
 But it also seems meet and right that one should try.
 Lennon said something about nothing being new in rock after “Great Balls of Fire.”  In a sense, he’s right.
 I mean, I’d never question his authority.
 But, we still try, right?
 He still tries, God bless him.
 Is “Like a Rolling Stone” better than “Great Balls of Fire?”  Is “Working Class Hero?”  If so, why?

The first time she took my cock out was in her backyard, leaning against her house, her mother moving around in the kitchen right over our heads—this is what you did back then.
 Were parents oblivious?
 I don’t know.
 Anyway, she takes it out---and this is like the first time either of us has bared anything except our souls and she was just fascinated with it.
 And I don’t know where this knowledge comes from but she knew immediately how to do what needed to be done.
 She was jerking on me so expertly—well, hell, maybe anything feels right the first time—and, very quickly—I was young---I squirted all over both of us.
 It was a surprise.
 I don’t know what she expected to happen but there was this like fountain, as if I had stored it up for a decade, and there was some on her hand, her forearm, her shirt.
 And the look on her face (laughs) well, let’s just say, it was obvious that it was not what she expected.
 But, she liked it.

I occasionally saw shadowy shapes darting through the trees ahead or to either side of us, but there wasn't any way to be sure it was Isaac and Jasmin instead of Brandon and his entire pack.
 A faint howl from behind us caused Alec to put on another terrifying burst of speed as we left the lane and turned to parallel the road.
 The sight of branches clawing at us as we slipped by them with little more than inches to spare was too much.
 I finally closed my eyes and ducked down as close to Alec's neck as I could get.
 With one less sense distracting me, the rest of them kicked into high gear.
 I could feel every step, including the occasional slide as the rough gravel we were running on wasn't up to bearing our combined weight without slipping.
 The bitter taste of fear along the back of my tongue was surprisingly strong, but even so I found my thoughts dwelling on the sheer pleasure of having my arms wrapped around Alec's rock-hard upper body.
 The high-pitched scream of a performance engine pulled me away from my absurd musings.
 James' blue and white Accord passed us doing the better part of twice the legal speed limit, and then flipped around with the distinctive squeal of overworked tires.
 Alec veered up onto the road as I looked back to find that even as fast as he was running, the Accord was still gaining on us at a prodigious rate.

As people develop, their aspirations rise and higher level needs emerge – needs for education, health care, balanced diet, entertainment, travel and communication – multiplying demand for new workers to provide them.
 Of course, there can be and are temporary dislocations and disorientations, sometimes severe, resulting from the rapid speed of social transformation that makes existing attitudes and skills obsolescent within a lifetime or less and compels human beings to learn to adapt faster and further than ever before in human history.
 This is the challenge posed by the evolution of humanity from the physical to mental stage, the flip side of the process that has given birth to all the miraculous achievements of the past few hundred years.
 It is a challenge posed to all humanity to expand our minds and acquire more flexible attitudes, to learn and adapt faster, to convert the stress of change into the joy of higher accomplishment.
 The world that is emerging is one of unprecedented opportunity to tackle the problem of unemployment that emerged with the Industrial Revolution, the massive movement of people from the land into the cities, massive migrations from one country and continent to another in search of economic opportunities, and the lightning speed of technological development that has eradicated traditional occupations while spawning whole new types and fields of human activity.
 Thus, we are faced with the paradox: an employment problem of unprecedented dimension coupled with an opportunity of unprecedented magnitude; a problem that is not going to be eliminated any time soon by the force of market mechanisms alone, but one which can be dramatically diminished by the appropriate action of governments around the world.
 Opportunities, strategies, instruments and mechanisms are not lacking, provided there is a commitment and determination of commensurate strength, a commitment that is best formulated and enshrined by a recognition of employment as a fundamental human right supported by constitutional guarantees, a commitment that must be translated into a determination by all countries to implement a broad spectrum of available strategies to address the issue today.
 Among these strategies, the greatest necessity is for every country to continuously upgrade the quality, quantity and, most importantly, relevance of educational and vocational training programs to equip its citizens with the knowledge and skills needed for productive engagement in a rapidly evolving world.
 Food Security
 The world produces more than sufficient food to amply provide for all of humanity.

“When did I say we would?”
 “When we first met,” Qurrah said.
 “You said the cooperation between the races needs to end.
 If we are to destroy our home, I must know when.”
 Then Velixar did something completely unexpected.
 He laughed.
 “It will not be our hands that destroy Woodhaven,” Velixar said.
 “King Vaelor will do so for us by starting a war that will give us the dead we need.”
 “How?” Qurrah asked.
 The fire burned in Velixar’s eyes, deep with anticipation.

 Liz – I think John finally let it go.
 He seems to have learned that from Eugene.
 Jim – Is that so?
 Liz – Seems to be.
 Jim – I wonder what Eugene has happened to learn from Johnny.
 Liz – That I’m not sure of, but it doesn’t seem to be any sort of skill at video games.
 Jim – That’s for sure.
 I thought I was bad at games, but Gene, ten dollars in twenty minutes is just terrible.

He led the prisoners through the door and walked out onto the top of the tower.
 The circular roof was flat and open to the sky.
 The only covering was the landing for the stairs in the East corner.
 The cool night air refreshed his spirits somewhat.
 Before the prisoners could look around, he shoved them to the right side and strode over to Ravenhurr, who was peering into the night sky through a long tube with tiny glass panes at each end.
 Ravenhurr loved to boast that the tube brought the stars closer to him.
 He was never one to hurry about anything, at least not before tonight.
 At that moment, though, his lean body quivered with excitement.
 “Master," Rodregas said, with a respectful bow, "The prisoners are ready.” Ravenhurr looked up.
 His eyes passed over Rodregas to glance at the prisoners.

Ahhh.
 Those soft, slender hands imitated what she'd felt him do to her, rubbing and caressing.
 He only wished he could get her to do his chest as well so that he could gaze up at her as she ran her hands over him.
 Marie liked touching him.
 He was big and muscular, and she'd thought that just looking at him without his shirt was a great pleasure.
 But that was before she'd gotten to run her hands over him.
 After a few minutes she stopped and lay down with a sigh.
 The beach was beautiful, and the air smelled so good.
 She liked being here with Rick.
 All morning he'd looked at her like she was a goddess.

I find myself muttering a line a line from Kerouac, maybe from Dharma Bums.
 “If we knew time, we would know everything.” While contemplating that idea, I begin to suspect that in some real though unfathomable way I’m not only here and now, driving alongside the silvery ocean, in Pismo Beach, June 2010.
 I’m also with my last best friend Olga, a few years ago, talking about poetry in a Greek Café.
 And I’m way back with Eric on the sea cliffs just outside the cemetery, and even father back, riding beside my dad over the mountains in the old Chevy bobtail.
 Then I remember a strange idea from the philosopher Blaise Pascal, a line from his book Penses, which contends not only is Jesus alive, he continues to be crucified for our sins.
 So, maybe Christ didn’t only die for us way back in time, but he's still dying for us.
 “Wow,” I mumble, “if you can’t adore that fellow, you’re really a hard case.”

I found myself reevaluating her now that I knew she was Steed’s sister.
 Chevelle noticed me watching her.
 “Do you mind staying with Ru—” My expression cut him off.
 “I have some business to take care of outside of town.
 She has given me her word she will behave.” He eyed her as he spoke, a warning.
 She replied from the open door of her room, “Yes, yes.
 No naughtiness.” And then, under her breath, “On my part.” “No qualifications, Ruby.” “Just teasing.
 Now go, we have stuff to do.” My stomach knotted.
 Stuff.
 Chevelle appeared reluctant to get up.

Marie rocked on her bed, sobbing against her knees.
 Why couldn't she have realized all this before she'd had the opportunity to return?

 "Yes.
 Come in, Mother."
 Mrs. Tranton went to sit on the edge of the bed.
 "How are you feeling?"
 "All right."

Rodregas sat and watched as Doi’van and then Imeralda undertook the inscription of the minor sigil.
 From Rodregas’ perspective the next two seemed to withstand the pain a lot better than then he had.
 After all three were completed Imeralda used her magic to inscribe Jordaan.
 The healing sigil was the only sigil commonly used by magic users.
 A few were known to use sigils that improved memory or allowed one to store excess magic.
 After the sensation faded Rodregas felt no different than before.
 Rodregas had the feeling that Jordaan would have liked to keep the little frog; it was a powerful tool in the hands of an Elemental Healer like Jordaan, but Rodregas was not willing to give it up, and Jordaan never actually asked.

 His back twisted and he fell, a motionless heap on the ground.
 His body was bent out of recognition.
 It was over.
 My ears had stopped ringing the moment he’d hit the ground.

 Rhys and Rider were once again gone from sight.

We believe that a properly conceived effort to draw on the best available knowledge and experience of other countries can generate a transition strategy that avoids the dangers and pitfalls of the initial approach to reform and puts in place the essential foundations for the new system to function effectively and generate benefits for the people before the dawn of the new century.
 In the preceding chapters we have tried to draw attention to the uncommon opportunities that the world presents at the dawn of a new millennium for the abolition of war and the eradication of poverty.
 None will question the desirability of achieving peace, democratic freedoms and prosperity for all.
 But many may doubt the practical feasibility of accomplishing these necessary goals.
 Every great endeavour requires a proportionate investment of energy and resources for its accomplishment.
 The realization of peace and prosperity is no exception.
 What, then, are the resources required for this achievement and where are we to find them?
 The history of civilization is the process of humankind discovering greater and greater resources and learning how to utilize them to acquire higher and higher levels of physical security, productive power and comfort.
 In the earliest phase, these resources were almost exclusively material.
 The next phase brought the discovery of tools and instruments that made the material resources far more productive and valuable than before.

She coaxed him into the water, where they swam and floated on gentle waves.
 He stayed in until his stomach was rumbling loudly enough to frighten the fish, and then he convinced Marie to leave the water by promising her a hot dog.
 It was a treat she rarely had.
 So he bought her one with the works, along with onion rings and a Sprite.
 She'd never had either of those two, and she sighed and rolled her eyes as if she were feasting on ambrosia.
 Since she'd had Coke but never heard of Sprite, he assumed that Sprite hadn't been invented by 1927, but he wondered if maybe the fact that she'd never had onion rings was due to her social class.
 Times had definitely changed where food was concerned.
 You had to be extremely wealthy and travel in very exclusive circles if you'd never had onion rings or-- "Pizza!"
 she exclaimed when she saw a girl walk by with a slice.

 “There you are, my Fredora!” She was always trying out new nicknames for me.
 It was no secret I despised my given name: Elfreda Georgiana Suzetta Glaforia.
 I decided, not for the first time, my father must have been a drunken imp.
 Not that I could remember him, but I could definitely blame him because the father was always responsible for naming the firstborn.
 It wasn’t as if you could get more unoriginal than using the ancient word meaning “elf”, but he certainly hadn’t needed to follow it with a string of ridiculous, flowery—I stopped mid-thought, realizing my tutor was watching me.
 “Hey, Junnie,” I said, forcing a smile.
 “What’s on the schedule for today?” She smiled in return, straightening the deep blue sash that tied her tunic.
 “How do you feel about studying the lineages?” She knew I hated trying to memorize endless pages of names and dates, and didn’t seem surprised by my groan of complaint.
 “Well, let’s get to it then,” she said, leading me through the tiny living area toward the back room.

I realized then I hadn’t been dismissed.
 It had been a direction for the guard.
 He wrenched me beside him, jerking unnecessarily, and then shoved me through the door to my room.

 I threw myself onto the bed.
 I felt absolutely wretched.
 Actually, I felt worse than that.
 I felt as if I’d been poisoned.

 While Harruq was skilled in swords and had all the muscle, Qurrah possessed far more interesting talents.
 Qurrah mumbled words, sick and spidery.
 The bones in the slab of meat snapped erect as if pulled by invisible strings.
 He kept whispering, his eyes wide.
 The meat floated from his hands and then lowered into the fire.
 Qurrah twirled his finger, and the slab turned as if on a spit.
 “We’re eating fancy tonight,” Harruq said, tossing the pot back to its corner.
 His stomach growled as the aroma of cooked meat filled his nostrils.

 If-if I were to keep this beautiful ring, the first thing I'd want to do would be to run to my mother and tell her all about it.
 But I can't go to her.
 And when I can finally run to her, I won't be wearing this ring."
 Slowly she removed the ring from her finger.
 "I love you, Rick.

 But I have to go home!"
 Rick drew her into his arms, feeling torn apart himself.

He isn't here, so possibly they're going down together."
 It'd been a fairly slender thread upon which to hang my hopes.
 Somehow my dream of seeing Les Misérables had morphed into a dream of seeing Les Misérables with Rachel.
 We still didn't get to spend much time together, but she was rapidly becoming the only person I could confide in besides Brandon.
 A boyfriend, or near-boyfriend, was nice, but some things just needed to be shared with another female.
 I couldn't tell my mom about my feelings for Brandon or she'd absolutely freak.
 After spending so much time lying to her about the origin of the almost four dozen roses, I couldn't afford any kind of slip in that regard.
 She'd thought the single rose, Lagrimas del Angel, as I was calling it now, had been sweet and thoughtful, especially when I'd told her it was from an anonymous admirer.
 The other roses had been an entirely different matter.
 I'd had to do some pretty quick talking to convince her I didn't know who they were from either.

Proven methods are available and have been commercially applied with great success, as the achievements of Israel so dramatically demonstrate, radically to reduce water consumption by as much as five- to ten-fold, while at the same time significantly increasing crop yields.
 The most productive of these methods, involving the construction of greenhouses, is too capital-intensive for immediate wide spread adoption in developing countries.
 Drip and sprinkler irrigation are far more moderate in cost and still result in enormous savings of water.
 The cost of adopting these methods can be further reduced by more widely popularizing them, so as to achieve increasing economies of scale in their manufacture.
 8.Low-input sustainable agriculture.
 While we have argued against pressure on food-deficit developing countries to reduce their comparatively low-level usage of mineral fertilizers and chemical pesticides, empirical studies sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences and the Department of Agriculture in the USA found strong evidence, long resisted by scientists and commercial farmers in the West, that chemical-free farming can be as productive and cost-effective as chemical-based methods.
 Industrial countries that offer subsidies to encourage chemical usage should modify their policies to provide active incentives for the use of chemical-free methods instead.
 During the last ten years, Indonesia has succeeded in bringing down the consumption of chemical pesticides without adversely affecting grain production through the nationwide adoption of integrated pest management systems for food crop protection.
 India has launched a massive national training programme to popularize bio logical methods of pest control, which can reduce the consumption and cost of chemical pesticides by 50 to 75 per cent.
 Public education programmes of this type are needed at the national and international level to disseminate information about chemical-free methods to producers and to educate consumers in developed and developing countries about both the health and environmental benefits of organically grown produce.

 So just because you tried hard this morning, that doesn’t mean that trying hard tomorrow or the next day or the next won’t work.” She smiled.
 “That’s true.” “So you’ll keep trying.” “Yes.” “Now I’m sad.”  He met her eyes and then looked away.
 “I’m sorry.”  She hugged him, laying her head on his shoulder.
 “I just wish I could make you happy.” “You do.”  She raised her head to look at him.
 “You do make me happy, Rick.
 It’s just that .

Sit over there where you won't distract Britney from just how poorly she's doing in my class.
 There's an extra book on the shelves in the back."
 Britney rolled her eyes as she went to her assigned desk, but I suspected she was actually relieved we'd been split up.
 Mrs. Campbell didn't seem like the kind of teacher you could get away with ignoring, so I retrieved an algebra book from the back of the room and sat at my desk.
 Any thoughts about finding out why hiking was off limits quickly melted away once class started.
 Math had never been my favorite subject.
 I'd always managed to pull A's or at least A-'s, but hated all of the little nitpicky rules.
 Unfortunately, after missing a whole month of classes, I was at least as bad off in Algebra as I was in Biology.
 Mrs. Campbell was solving problems with so many variables in them it was like watching alphabet soup spontaneously re-arrange itself on her overhead projector.
 Not only that, things were being squared and cubed, an operation with which I had only passing familiarity.

For a hundred years, she’d be gone.
 I wanted nothing more of Fannie.
 Nothing more of any of this.
 I didn’t know what I would do, but by the time I reached Chevelle, I knew what I wanted: to retrieve my mother’s things from the vault.
 I would leave this wretched place behind.
 I made my stance more formal to match his as I said, “I want to learn transfer magic.” His mouth tightened and he turned his head, a half shake.
 “You taught me fire,” I argued.
 “For protection, Freya.” “Please,” I begged.
 He hesitated.
 I didn’t know how to convince him.

Brandon smiled as he pulled up and found me patiently waiting for the school bus.
 "One of these days you're going to go ahead and wait for me at your house, and then I'll know you finally trust me."
 I didn't feel much like playful banter, but I marshaled a semi-convincing smile and gave it my best go.
 "Oh, I trust you, I just know that you've got more important things to worry about.
 One of these times you'll either forget to come get me, or you'll forget to tell me you're not coming by anymore."
 Brandon let the silence build for several seconds.
 "I'd try and convince you I'm not going to do any of that to you, but I suspect that's just going to take time."
 I was busy kicking myself for having cast such a pall over the morning, when Brandon sighed.
 "We should talk about what happened to you yesterday."
 "I don't know what you're talking about.

It was so blatantly coy, I almost couldn't believe I was saying it.
 It had been said though.
 All there was left to do was hope he didn't decide I was the biggest loser to ever walk the earth.
 The extended silence was almost enough to make me decide he was going to get up and leave.
 "All right, I'll come over and lean against your bed, but you really need to try and sleep.
 You've got to be nearly exhausted."
 "What about you, mister superhero shape shifter?
 You've been up longer than I have.
 I'm not the only one who needs to sleep."
 I tried not to let my voice get too sing-song, but I felt a completely irrational thrill as he quietly crossed over to my side of the room.

"Of course I don't have to pick you up.
 It's more a matter of wanting to, if I can say that without making things all weird.
 I have obligations at school, people who depend on me.
 I can't spend the time I'd like getting to know you there, so it just made sense to free up some time in the mornings to make that happen."
 Everything was just too unreal.
 I couldn't believe it was all happening, so I chose to ignore the implications of what he was saying.
 Boys like him didn't go for girls like me.
 They didn't even acknowledge the possibility unless they were after something.
 We'd been driving in more or less comfortable silence for several minutes before I decided to act before things got uncomfortable.
 "So, tell me about yourself."

"Can you show me now?” Rodregas hesitated; he did not want to show her the books right away.
 Instead, he wanted to see what kind of training Doi’van had.
 But he had never been able to turn down a beautiful woman.
 “Sure,” he said walking back to the barn and the wagon.
 Rodregas jumped on the back, making the wagon squeal in alarm at his weight, and opened ‘his’ trunk and pulled out the last blanket left in it, the one he had wrapped the books up in.
 Rodregas unrolled the blanket on the back of the now mostly empty wagon showing the dozen books that he had saved from Ravenhurr’s library.
 Imeralda reached out for one of the closest, but then stopped as her fingers touched them, as if a spark of lightning had hit her.
 Obviously, she could feel that same power Rodregas had.
 That was interesting.
 She then ran her hand from one to the next until she had touched all twelve books.

 But if she'd met Rick here, fallen in love with him, and then had to-to go to China or somewhere with him and never seen her family again, would she have done it?
 She hugged her knees, tears flowing down her cheeks.
 She knew without a doubt now that she would have.
 If she could have said good-bye to her family, let them know that she was safe and happy, she would have stayed with Rick.
 She realized now that she hadn't clung to the hope of getting home because she loved and needed and wanted her family and home more than she loved and needed and wanted Rick; she'd clung to that hope because of the feeling that she'd been .

They returned to their rooms that night tired; they had tracked down twelve more squires.
 All had at least two ribbons; and all swore secrecy at the source of their sigil.
 The biggest surprise was probably Geriodon, who had beaten Rodregas earlier that day.
 Rodregas could not argue against sharing the minor sigil as he clearly fit the description of a worthy candidate.
 Geriodon was more than happy to swear that he had no love for the Guild and that Justice should be dealt to all equally.
 But before accepting the sigil he wanted to be sure that any Shadow Order he joined was mostly about secrecy to protect themselves, and that he would still be able to compete for true knighthood in the Order of the Soaring Heavens.
 Rodregas dropped into his cot tired and exhausted.
 Even with his healing sigil he had needed a full night’s rest, but duty did not wait for what a man needed.
 Imeralda woke him slightly after dawn, and Rodregas could tell that both she and Doi’van had spent the few hours left of the night working on what was left of their equipment.
 The tear in both his leather shirt and chain were sewn up, the first with thread the second with steel wire.

Certainly not.
 Worry?
 Fear?
 Doubt?
 The only emotion he was certain of was confusion.
 So he walked and would walk for the rest of the morning, wishing there was something he could do to banish the sick, hollow feeling in his stomach.
 There was nothing he knew to do though, and that made it so much worse.

He decided that the only thing left to do was plan to get together what gear they could and head back out.
 CHAPTER 12 TO WALK AN OLD PATH
 Rodregas was surprised to find a pile of equipment outside his door the next morning, and Imeralda sorting through the pile.
 It appeared to be mostly their equipment plus miscellaneous pieces of slaver gear.
 Doi’van stood watching, clearly not sure what to make of it.
 When Rodregas tried to apologize Imeralda ignored him and instead said, “We traded the Immortal Guard equipment for safe harbor here at the village for healing.
 But, of course, there were also regular slaver guards and I claimed their equipment and any money that was in their personal money pouches.” “Your armor got pretty chopped up,” she continued, “and Doi’van did not have any armor to start with.
 I have been trading excess gear and coins to repair armor and to refit some of the other armor to fit Doi’van and yourself.
 We still had our three horses, but none of them were too great to begin with; the two were good for pulling carriages, the other was too old.” “True,” Rodregas said nodding his agreement.
 “Jordaan knows horse flesh,” she went on, “and we were able to trade the three old horses for one of the Immortal Guards’ horses.

I still wasn't sure which option I preferred.
 Every moment we spent together made me want to touch him that much more, but the idea of being addicted to anyone, even him, was more than a little unsettling.
 "Sure, Rachel tells me I'm entirely unreasonable on at least a daily basis."
 I stuck my tongue out at him, and started back through the book in search of the missing information.
 There were so many other ways I'd rather be spending our time together, but he was adamant I not fall further behind in my classes.
 I looked up to ask for a hint, and found him staring off into space.
 "Penny for your thoughts?"
 His smile was a half-hearted thing.
 "Mother is playing again.
 She just finished up with 'Courtship', so the next one will be 'Welcoming'."

 They asked you to stop and you did?
 Why didn’t I think of that?
 Eugene – There were eight large hairy men, and they had knives and clubs.
 I assume you’ve seen movies about bikers.

Whatever was there had run away because of the attack, and recently.
 I questioned my sister again—she’d had some time to cool down—but she was no help.
 I immediately knew she had not even considered that whatever she had been so interested in was still out here, probably close.
 I didn’t clue her in.
 After a little more time there, I acted as if I’d lost interest and headed home.
 Tomorrow, I will follow the tracks.
 I will find whoever was there and solve the mystery of their rudimentary tools and strange huts.
 I yawned.
 After a quick glance around, I slid the book back into my pack.
 I rolled over and fell asleep listening to Ruby’s quiet tune.

My ankle hurt so bad, it was all I could do to get myself standing and then hobble the fifteen feet to the door.
 When I finally managed to get the door open and found empty space where there should have been a person, I almost swore.
 Then I saw the incredibly beautiful rose on our porch.
 I picked it up, trimmed the bottom inch or so off with a knife, and got it into some water acting out of nothing more than pure habit.
 Dad had always kept at least a pair of rose bushes alive.
 He'd loved nothing more than giving Mom roses.
 Once I'd safely done my part to help prolong the future life of the gorgeous specimen, I got down to really examining it.
 I was far from an expert on roses, but I'd looked through pictures of hundreds of different kinds of tea roses, and never seen anything quite like this one.
 It was as big as some of the largest specimens I'd seen, and had at least fifty percent more petals than most of the 'very full' varieties I was familiar with.
 That in and of itself was pretty amazing, but nothing in comparison to the petals themselves.

They were able to briefly incapacitate the wolves, giving Rhys and Rider less warning of their approach before you were attacked.” He hesitated.
 “When we heard the alert, I turned.
 Your eyes were closed.” I didn’t comment, so he continued, “I was able to catch you just before your horse dropped.
 I’ve no idea why they attacked him.
 They should have been focused on you.” I wasn’t sure they had attacked the horse.
 Maybe it was because I’d been there, in his mind, controlling him.
 “What happened to Rhys and Rider?” “They broke to keep from fighting such a sizeable force alone.
 They circled back to meet us.
 In the disorder, they lost track of the wolves.” “But the wolves weren’t hurt?” “They had been strung up by vine among the trees, but alive.” I winced at the idea.
 “Why?” A wry smile crossed his lips and I couldn’t help but focus on them for a moment.

The teachers to whom Eric surrendered turned him over to the police, who drove him home to Sylvia and sent a report about him to the school board.
 A few days later, Eric and Kenny got expelled for having been intoxicated on school grounds.
 Mrs. Hazel Bole, our vice principal, summoned Billy and me.
 She was a big woman, in size and spirit, a person of understanding and compassion, who tried hard to prepare us seniors for the real world.
 She said, “I know you two were with Eric and Kenny.” “So expel me,” I said.
 “Me too,” Billy said.
 She shook her head.
 “You probably think I could keep Eric and Kenny in school, but here’s the way things are.
 Once the police get involved, the school board has to expel.
 That’s policy.

 The next gasp was less impressive, but tangibly more genuine.
 Even my being next couldn't stop a flash of satisfaction at the way Britney was finally having to face some of the consequences of her actions.
 Mrs. Campbell dismissed her with a wave, waiting until she'd left, shutting the door with a tad more force than strictly necessary.
 "While I can't for a moment understand why you've chosen to befriend Britney, I can't fault you on your willingness to help her despite her flaws."
 I should have been overjoyed I wasn't in trouble.
 Instead I felt guilty for being given far more credit than I deserved.
 I opened my mouth to object, but was waved back into silence.
 "Obviously I don't want you to make disrupting my class a habit, but that isn't why I wanted to talk to you.
 Your studies are coming along nicely, and I've heard quite a few good things about you from other sources, so I'd like to offer you a job."

I let my door swing shut, and walked over to Rachel's side so that I could see the entire parking lot.
 Empty as it was, it didn't take very long to realize Britney's little white Saturn was gone.
 "I thought you might still be here."
 The voice caught me by surprise.
 I probably would've jumped and screamed a little if I hadn't recognized it.
 Brandon was walking towards us with his characteristic casual stride, and I felt my heart speed up a little as I remembered our conversation from earlier in the day.
 "Brandon!
 What are you still doing here?"
 I heard some movement off to my right, but was so focused on Brandon's response that none of it really registered.
 The smile gracing his breathtaking face was like the ultimate treat.

“Why?” A wry smile crossed his lips and I couldn’t help but focus on them for a moment.
 “Because the wolves would have fought to the death, and Grand Council does not kill animals with magic.” I remembered my mother.
 “Only elves?” His mocking smile widened.
 “Only elves.” They thought killing an animal with magic was evil, dark, but they were hunting us down.
 To burn us.
 I considered the alternative—pierced through with arrows, blessed with a prayer—and I laughed.
 His eyes were intense as he reached to gently cup my neck, fingers resting at my spine, thumb grazing the base of my ear.
 I felt him urge me forward, and my breath caught, heart stuttering into a broken lope.
 And then Ruby was beside us from out of nowhere, her words startling me back to the cold, dull room.
 “They’re coming in.” Chevelle leaned back, his fingers brushing my collarbone when he pulled away.

It made sense, but it was all I could do to keep my eyes grounded despite the cold prickles running up and down my spine.
 Actual conversation was just too much, so I sat quietly with my head slightly bowed while the song ran its course.
 Alec's fingers gently pulled my chin up as the music ended.
 "Dance with me?"
 I mustered a brave smile as I nodded and let him lead me out onto the dance floor.
 It was a slow song this time, and Alec didn't protest when I abandoned all pretense of actual dancing, and just leaned into him hungrily.
 The reassurance I was seeking was weaker than normal.
 The solid feel of his body was just as permanent as always, but there was no tingle where our skin touched.
 Almost as though sensing my thoughts, Alec hugged me tightly and buried his chin in my hair.
 "I know you don't want to hear this, but it isn't too late for you to change your mind.

Obviously, people acted so boorishly because they weren't as cool or enlightened as me.
 During mass, I considered the priest's accent monotonous and uninspired, as though after forty years of mouthing the same lines, it all sounded to him like blah blah blah.
 Attending Catholic services, communion tries my patience, as I'm not allowed to participate.
 But while a young woman read, “He took bread, gave thanks and broke it and gave it to them, saying, ‘This is my body given for you.
 Do this in remembrance .
 .
 .’” and the choir chanted, “Sing hallelujah to the Lord” a breath of Spirit touched me.
 Through all the minutes while wafers got distributed, I heard a small voice reminding me that I ought to pluck the log out of my own eye.
 So I was slightly less mean by the time Mother Teresa walked to the altar.
 In strong yet gentle English, she said, “Let us ask Our Lady to give us her heart, so that we will offer service to the poorest of the poor.” Neither weathered skin nor stooped shoulders could alter the beauty she exhibited, as she recited from the Gospel of Matthew.

 You gotta realize multi-tracking was relatively new, and, man we were babes in the wood, naives, we didn’t know how to play without someone playing with us.

“Today,” he yelled out, “we have a match of men and women who are ready to become knights, to be the very Champions of the Gods on this world.
 They are all worthy, but there can be only one new knight this day.” Faurrenida looked around slowly catching each of them by the eye.
 Rodregas was caught up in the commanding presence of the man.
 “To the Order and to the Celestials!” his voice was half command and half prayer.
 Everyone including combatants and those watching from wall and window responded, so that the words swirled around the arena.
 “To the Order and to the Celestials!” This time the Grand Marshal seemed to look around at all the spectators until finally he nodded, satisfied.
 Without another word he strode out.
 Imeralda followed him as did all the squire’s attendants.
 It was time for the final match.
 Rodregas left his shield and mace relaxed at his side and strode over to Nordien, who stood with shield and mace at the ready.

A rash impulse filled him, an insane desire to tear the paper to shreds and return to his liege bearing a lie on his lips.
 Under normal circumstances the king would know no difference.
 His advisors, however, were many, and every one of them would betray Antonil for the chance to gain esteem in the eyes of the king.
 No, he would have to deliver the message, regardless of his desires.
 He sighed one final time, turned toward his army, and began the march.

 Where Celed and Singhelm met there was a small clearing.
 No buildings or monuments marked it, just a single circle of grass upon which no house would ever be built.
 On that spot, Singhelm the Strong and Ceredon Sinistel, leaders of Neldar’s troops and the Erzen elves, respectively, had made a pact that a city could exist between the two races without bloodshed.

A family can look perfect from the outside but be quite the opposite on the inside.
 I have lived such a life.
 I do not know what made me do what I did for my son but I can only surmise that it was a combination of all of the defining moments in my life that lead me to where I am today.

 Steve and Ashley: I would later find out that Steve posted bail and was busted shortly thereafter for robbery and assault as he pistol-whipped and beat his next victim.
 By the time he went to trial for this bust, he had also been busted again for another drug deal.

I’m not sure which concert it comes from but I’m guessing an early one.
 It doesn’t sound like we’re even playing the same song.
 And Skippy sounds like he’s off in Oz—he was often a lost mook.
 CM:  	What else?
 BG:  	Have you heard this thing or not?
 CM:  	No, I haven’t heard it.
 It was being circulated in Memphis right before I came out here.
 There’s a renewed interest in the band, as you know.
 BG:  	Yeah.
 There’s a run-through version of “Wendy Ward.”  An a cappella version of “Yummy Yummy Yummy.” (laughs)  I don’t know where the hell that came from.

I reached up absentmindedly to stroke the tops of my ears.
 I looked up then, at the elders who surrounded me.
 Their faces were astonished.
 “She is… human,” they said.
 I took a steadying breath and spat out, “No.” They stared at me, incredulous.
 I spoke deliberately.
 “She is elf.
 I name her… Elfreda.”
 My heart had stopped.
 And then it surged as blood rushed to my face, my neck.

“You know better Jazell then to take on a monster by yourself.
 You never know what kind it is until you have already changed,” he scolded me and I could feel a lecture coming.
 I looked down at leg.
 Claw marks ran up my shin and my blue blood was soaking my pants.
 “I had to Seth; it was heading for my house.
 That made me panic a bit.” “I don’t care Jazell; if I hadn’t been here I would have found you shredded to small pieces.
 All you had to do was send me a quick text and I would have showed up to help.
 But you didn’t.” I sighed in annoyance, not in the mood for this right now.
 Seth was like this sometimes, strict and serious, but he was normally a jokester.
 He’s strict on the fact that we attack in groups, mostly for the reason that he didn’t want anything to happen to our group.

Donovan somehow managed to respectfully circumvent any order he thought prevented him from taking adequate care of Alec's family.
 "Tell me about Christmas at the Paige house."
 I blinked a couple of times.
 The progress I'd made lately notwithstanding, I half expected the question to drive me into a panic attack.
 Apparently Alec's presence was proof against a second near attack today.
 "I don't know.
 We always used to do the standard kind of stuff.
 Presents, eggnog and the Christmas story.
 Usually Dad made us breakfast Christmas morning and then we'd drive out of the city later in the day and go sledding.
 I hadn't thought about what it would be like this year."

After what we just went through with him… I looked Brandon in his guilty darkened eyes and I said, “Prepare yourself to find out what will happen to you every time you lie to me… are you ready?” Before he could reply or even contemplate my words, I felt the crack of Brandon’s nose on my knuckles and he flew backwards off his feet.
 My family’s loud simultaneous gasps accompanied Harry and Bryce’s rush to restrain me as if I was going to continue the beating.
 Maybe kill Brandon.
 This is how angry we all were.
 How out of our element.
 And now I’d done it.
 Lisa jumped up screaming and crying and yelled, “Stop!” Brandon lay face down and his blood soaked the carpet beneath his head; his hands clutched his face; he moaned and rolled over.
 Blood oozed from between his clenched fingers and ran down his chest when he sat up.
 My wife was hysterical and rightfully so.
 I stood there numb, wondering what I had done and how did my efforts to be the best father I could be turn into this?

That didn't sound like Alec at all.
 "Are you sure, Mom?
 They didn't arrange anything you could use to verify they're for real?"
 I suddenly realized why parents got such a big kick out of catching their kids doing something wrong.
 Mom looked so sheepish I almost laughed.
 "Well, he did say he'd arrange for an immediate advance to be wired over to our bank, but it's closed on Saturdays, and it isn't like I can go calling up the bank president for something trivial like that."
 I opened my mouth, still unsure what to say in response to her latest excuse, only to be interrupted by her cell phone again.
 "Yes, this is she.

As much as I'd rather stay here and bask in your beauty, it's time for more training."
 I tried to keep the disappointment from my face, but his expression fell a little despite my best efforts.
 "You're unhappy with me?"
 "No.
 I mean not really unhappy, at least not with you.
 Maybe with the situation.
 I just feel left out of everything that's going on.
 I know you don't want to get me any more deeply involved with 'dangerous information', but it really sucks sometimes."
 Alec gazed at me for several seconds, and then sighed.

They were like the best thing we’d ever seen or heard.

 Did you ever get to sit in with the Hi Rhythm Section?

She smiled at her mother over her teacup.
 "Then why are you considering a September wedding?"
 "I think he'll propose soon.
 Don't you?"
 Mrs. Tranton managed to maintain a pensive expression for a few seconds but then smiled at her daughter.
 "Yes.
 And I think a September wedding would be perfect."
 They discussed bridesmaids and flowers and gardens.
 Marie would wear her mother's wedding gown, which had been carefully stored away for the last 28 years.
 Marie's grandmother had worn it as well, and when Marie took it off after her own wedding, it would go into storage for her daughter.

Emily was pacing in the background and Jason was standing off to the side, looking very uninterested in the current situation.
 Seth smiled at me and I felt myself blush.
 It was kind of embarrassing to get knocked out when no one else did.
 “Welcome back, zombie hunter girl,” Seth teased.
 “How long was I out?” I asked, blushing brighter.
 Except I couldn’t pin down the reason why.
 Seth frowned, “I don’t know but it seemed like forever.
 You scared us, Jazell.” “Especially Seth,” Emily piped up behind him.
 “He was the one going crazy to bandage you and was worrying more than the rest of us.” Seth’s face reached a new undiscovered level of red, “I didn’t want to lose a friend.” “Right…” Emily trailed off and smirked at him, wiggling her eyebrows.
 Seth squirmed slightly and avoided her gaze.

As amusing as my internal monologue was, I didn't let it slow my normal morning preparations.
 Almost before I knew it, I was downstairs and once again facing the dreaded decision of whether or not to eat breakfast.
 I already knew I wasn't hungry; the only real decision was how much of Mom's wrath I was willing to face later on.
 It wasn't until I had my hand on the doorknob that I remembered Brandon's promise to pick me up.
 I was so tired I actually considered for a second that he might have been serious.
 Sitting in his car, fighting not to look at his smiling gray eyes, it'd all seemed so reasonable.
 I'd lost my ride and he was grateful I'd saved him from having to interfere with Cassie, so he was going to become my personal chauffeur for the rest of the year.
 Looking at my empty lane, the school bus only minutes away, it seemed more likely Brandon wouldn't even remember talking to me.
 Just like every hot boy with every loser since the dawn of time.
 The thought hurt a little, but I'd had plenty of years to come to understand boys like that didn't go after girls like me.

Panicked sounds.
 I thought I recognized Chevelle’s voice and tried to focus on it, to understand the agony.
 “Frey,” he said, and something brushed my cheek, warm and feather light.
 The distant impression that it might have been the brush of lips had me drawing in a sharp breath, and I coughed, gasping to fill my lungs.
 The air shifted as those surrounding me moved in response.
 I forced my eyes open and found Ruby, Steed, and Chevelle.
 They looked for a moment as if they were suffering my pain… and then I realized the pain was gone, the siren was silenced.
 My breathing steadied, the fear abating, and their faces relaxed.
 Relief washed their expressions, but their postures remained stiff, alert.
 I pushed up to find the source of the danger and dizziness incapacitated me.

“Teach me,” Qurrah said, his mouth buried into the dirt.
 “Show me the power I have sought for so very long.”
 Velixar looked down at his thin, ragged apprentice.
 “Rise.

 Velixar taught until the stars retreated from the obnoxious sun.
 Qurrah returned home, his eyes sagging and his mind exhausted.
 When he climbed into bed, he fell asleep instantly.
 Not long after, Harruq rose, took his swords, and left for his own meeting.

So it came out on Laughing Buddha Jesus Phallus, this really underground Frisco label, started, I think, by Dino Valenti.
 Maybe not.
 Anyway, we did this heavy piece as a kind of lark—I was pissed, I admit by all the dismissals I was getting in the rock press, all the accusations of sell-out.
 So I did this little 45, this really wild piece of music—that’s a Stratocaster I’m playing but filtered through this mini-moog that Underwood brought with him.
 And damned if it wasn’t a hit.
 We didn’t even have a back for it, you know, a flipside.
 So I quickly wrote “Stately Plump Buck Mulligan” as a 12-bar blues, and we sort of adlibbed it in the studio.
 One take.
 Anyway, you heard it here first.

Then again all of Monday had flown by, not just the school portion of the day, so it really shouldn't have been a surprise today was doing likewise.
 After Spanish, Jasmin had escorted me to Mrs. Campbell's class.
 Telling her I wasn't going to be able to help out at the lab anymore had been one of the harder things I'd ever done, but she'd been surprisingly understanding.
 We'd scheduled my makeup test for the next day and I'd left with the sneaking suspicion she'd guessed more about what was really going on in Sanctuary than either pack would've liked.
 I'd been busy contemplating what Mrs. Campbell might have really figured out as we left the building, only to have Jasmin interrupt my musings with an apology of all things.
 She didn't get into specifics, and it was obvious she was still worried about the coming showdown with Brandon, but I was pretty sure she really was sorry.
 It didn't make us best friends and she was still an enigma, but it was a start.
 It even gave me hope maybe Jessica and James might eventually come around.
 I was still reeling in surprise as we walked out to the parking lot and met up with the rest of the pack, or rather the rest of the pack minus Alec.
 He'd shown up several minutes later, looking very satisfied with himself, but obviously unwilling to answer any questions.

The only effective evangelist I encountered in those days was Tony Tarantino, a lanky Jesus freak with frizzy red hair and an expression both bewildered and wise.
 I picked him up hitchhiking.
 He settled into the seat, set his Bible on his lap, stared at me for a minute and asked, “Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?” “Yep,” I said, and readied myself to field the standard subsequent questions.
 Tony said, “Oh.
 Good.” A week later, he was leading a Bible study at our house.
 Cliff’s not much of a talker.
 I believe nobody heard his stories from Vietnam until years afterward.
 I don’t pry, so I can’t be sure what goes on inside him, but I have no reason to think he believes in God, or that he doesn’t.
 But whether he believes or not, Cliff has gotten well blessed since our evening with Billy Graham.
 He has four wonderful kids, and Toni, who is one of those rarest of people who appear to grow brighter, stronger, and more beautiful every year.

The guard was very dead.
 Rodregas let go of the broken neck and stood quickly, trying to clear himself of the gore.
 Both slavers looked shocked at what had happened and Rodregas moved quickly to take advantage of their surprise.
 He went to the right and slammed his remaining sword into the Orqui.
 The slaver grunted with pain and surprise at his quick change of targets.
 Rodregas’ short sword caught him in the shoulder.
 The guard half fell and half stumbled away to safety.
 Rodregas turned to the final slaver and saw fear in his eyes.
 Then Rodregas looked around and saw that he was no longer facing just one remaining opponent, but now faced four including another Immortal Guard and three more slavers.
 He had hoped they could pick off enough with the Black Yew bows to keep odds like this against them.

 Britney shrugged with the supreme indifference of someone whose world extended only a few feet beyond their immediate person.
 "Just don't get me sick if you do.

 We were halfway to the tutoring lab, and the halls were nearly empty.
 Everyone was always in such a hurry to get out, to go home, or to a party.
 Anywhere but here.
 "Oh, speaking of boys, I saw Brandon between fifth and sixth period.
 I made sure he knew I'd get you home after tutoring.

Jimmy was one tough fellow.
 According to rumor, while fighting in the Golden Glove tournament, he had knocked another light-heavyweight into a coma.
 An equally tough surfer, Butch Van Artsdalen, rode shotgun.
 I strode to their car, jammed my head through rolled-down shotgun side window and stared at Kris.
 “You babysitting these guys?” “It didn’t work out,” she said.
 Butch grabbed the door handle, but Jimmy told him to be cool, and he motioned me around to his side of the car.
 After I staggered there, I lashed him with a string of curses for two-timing my cousin and stealing my girl.
 And I gave notice that if Kris didn’t get out and come with me, I was going to pluck them both out of the car and so on.
 Jimmy sat rubbing his temples.
 Then he rolled up the window, started the car, and droved away.

 She couldn't sleep that night.

These farmers tend to have lower levels of education, poor access to technology for upgrading productivity, less access to quality inputs and credit, poor access to storage and processing facilities, and higher losses due to post-harvest crop spoilage.
 Their problems are further aggravated by environmental degradation due to soil erosion, deforestation and depletion of water resources.
 Lack of effective organization and management is a common denominator linking all these deficiencies.
 More effective forms of organizations can eliminate or compensate for these deficiencies to a large extent.
 For example, in India more than 10 million farmers are successfully engaged in sugarcane cultivation, precisely because an established system of contract farming provides them with access to technology, quality inputs, credit and an assured market for their produce.
 India became the world leader in milk production only because of the power of scale conferred on small producers through the dairy cooperative movement.
 A similar organization is presently lacking for most other crops.
 The successful establishment of more than one million Self-Help Groups (SHGs) in India over the past three years providing access to credit for 15 million small farmers illustrates the power of organization.
 It is an indication that the phase of society’s predominant dependence on government initiatives for development is coming to a close.
 An organization combining the advantages of SHGs and contract farming through the agency of an NGO or an agri-business centre operated by farm and home science graduates or entrepreneurs can be successfully extended to other crops, providing the technical knowledge and essential inputs that small farmers need to raise productivity and farm incomes.

I’d like to have a brother.
 Jim – Johnny.
 Liz – Scratch that idea.
 Eugene – Johnny, that means I have two brothers now.
 Jim – I thought your math was better than that Gene.
 Liz – Really Gene, someone who is capable of at least high-school algebra should have caught onto that right away.
 Eugene – I forgot about Johnny, with all the excitement of the day.
 Liz – I wonder how much this is all going to cost.
 Eugene – Do you think it will be expensive?
 Liz – Court fees usually are.

His right arm hung limp, and his other hand clutched his shoulder.
 He desperately needed to bandage it but had no time.
 A wave of undead moans reached his sensitive ears.
 Dieredon shuddered.
 “How many does he command?” he asked.
 He crouched as he ran, his right arm dragging against the grass.
 Under normal circumstances, he might have been able to hold his own against the undead.
 However, these were not normal circumstances.
 Minutes passed, long and painful.
 The light of Woodhaven beckoned him to his left but he dared not approach.

"Donovan has very inflexible standards when it comes to some things.
 Dancing happens to be one of them.
 In fact, I don't think I'll ever forget the expression on Jasmin's face when he told her she could go clubbing all she wanted after he judged her suitably proficient in real dancing.
 He said he wouldn't have her 'seduced by throbbing beats and soulless contact' before he'd at least exposed her to proper dance steps."
 I felt a giggle surge past my lips, and pressed them tight before I could completely embarrass myself.
 "That's amazing.
 My dad thought knowing how to dance would make my first dance easier.
 It turned out to be a complete waste of time.
 Nobody asked me to dance and his lessons wouldn't have helped even if they had.
 Still, now I wish I'd done a better job of learning."

History being what it was, I probably heard about as much in that one hour as most everyone else did during the whole rest of the day.
 Mr. Simms seemed especially dense, and pretty much let everyone do whatever they wanted for the entire class.
 In deference to my new dedication to academic excellence, I finished up the reading, and then opened up my Biology book and started trying to get a handle on all of the items I'd thought I understood, but apparently hadn't.
 When the bell rang I limped back to my locker before making my painful way to Physics.
 I almost turned around and left when I saw the substitute again, but almost two decades of ingrained respect for authority figures propelled me into the room and to my seat.
 I happened to look up at the exact moment that Alec appeared in the doorway.
 I expected him to take one look at the sub and turn around like he'd done before, but he registered the presence of a substitute and then came inside regardless.
 It didn't make sense until the first girl all but fainted as he walked past her desk.
 Of course.
 He didn't like substitutes, and figured he had better places to be, but the draw of hero worship after having almost double-teamed Vincent was just too much to resist.

My head fell into my hands as I groaned.
 It took a while, but the anger eventually faded to a point where I realized I’d need a new plan.
 I couldn’t help but regret the flames had consumed the documents that had caused all this to begin with.
 I should have fully read them first.
 My heart tripped at the sound of cracking tinder beneath boot across the clearing.
 The fire had burned out, but the ashes were plenty evidence I’d been here.
 I ducked under the cover of a large spruce and watched.
 Chevelle walked through the tree line and my jaw clenched tight against a silent curse.
 He was alone.
 He kept walking as he looked my direction, surveying the damage from the fire.

Real estate prices there were outrageous, but Rick, with his connections and eye for property, had gotten this parcel for next to nothing.
 It was only a few blocks from the downtown area and considered too close for comfort by true members of the upper class.
 But for Rick it was perfect.
 Both his office and his neighbors were close but not too close, and he had a beautiful lawn in the front and a large patio and flower garden in the back.
 Rick smiled as he walked into his kitchen, loosening his tie.
 Lauri moaned every time she walked into the garden.
 What a waste, she always sighed, looking at him with reproach.
 A woman would love having that garden, but what did a man know about flowers?
 Truthfully, he knew very little, Rick mused as he set his cartons of Chinese on the counter and went to change clothes.
 He just knew that he enjoyed their beauty and scent.

“Please, my friend, there is no need for subservience here; let us enjoy a meal together.
 If you don’t mind, I have a few thoughts I would like to share with you over the food.” “Of course, my lord,” said Van’dret as he stood up he dared to focus on the Guild Dealer for the first time.
 Taiga wore the form of a High Elf male that was slim and graceful, as was most of its kind.
 His hair and eyes were a striking pale violet color, and his skin was a light nut color which made a strong contrast with his hair.
 This was highlighted by the similarly colored silk toga he wore.
 He wore no rings or accessories, his outfit simple, but extravagant.
 Van’dret suddenly wished he had thought to dress simpler for the occasion his green and emerald outfit with its gold trim seemed garish in comparison; and his human male form that normally seemed attractive and robust seemed ungainly and drab in comparison.
 Taiga’s manner continued to be friendly but inquisitive.
 The conversation started with a polite discussion on new spells that Van’dret was working on, and then moved to his thoughts on the recent political and economic tensions with the Romig Empire.
 Wine and food appeared on the table; Van’dret never saw it come, or the empty plates go.

Since I just finished with Rachel and was over here already, I thought I'd show you the steps you're missing."
 I nodded my assent as I mentally filed away both his name and the girl's.
 Surprisingly enough, Albert was a good teacher, pointing out the steps I'd been skipping over, and even explaining why they were important.
 It was rare enough to find a school teacher who could really teach math these days, finding a student who could teach was nearly a miracle.
 Rachel packed up her things while I was being instructed in the finer points of inequalities.
 As she slid the last book into her backpack, Albert stepped away from my desk with another smile.
 I flipped over to the next chapter and started in on functions as Rachel exited out a corner door I hadn't noticed before.
 I saw a flash of the stunted, brown vegetation that the locals called grass before the door swung back closed.
 Suppressing an urge to just surrender and go outside until Britney finished up, I got started.
 The roar of some kind of high-performance engine a few seconds later almost changed my mind, but my native stubbornness kicked in before I let the thought get out of hand.

 “Amusing, though unnecessary.

 “Not my king,” Harruq muttered loud as he dared.

 He was large, well-muscled, and scratching at a long beard that stretched down to his belt.
 In a massive voice, he shouted to the mulling throngs.

 In Sometimes a Great Notion, Joe Ben used to be, as a teen, so handsome and so enthralled by girls, he never could have stayed true to any one of them.
 But a motorcycle crash disfigured his perfect face.
 Still, his girlfriend sticks by him.
 She becomes his wife and the mother of his kids.
 And Joe Ben comes to believe that God had allowed that tragedy to save him from the fate of his father, who died a lonely, sex-obsessed drunk.
 Joe Ben is the book’s endearing and admirable character, a humble Christian of supreme courage.

Mr. Tranton asked, standing.
 "Yes.

 Marie was too stunned for a moment to move.
 Finally she walked into her father's embrace, glancing at her mother, who simply smiled at her.
 Apparently she'd prepared her father and brother well.
 They decided to leave for Cape Cod two weeks from Friday.
 Marie thought about the bathing suit Rick had bought her.

Imeralda had not seen him in such a mood before, not even during the battle with the slave caravan.
 Imeralda thought that Rodregas was only marginally better.
 The muscles of his neck and shoulders were bunched up and she could feel his anger through her bond with him.
 But he was also breathing deeply and through the bond she knew he was trying to control himself.
 Imeralda saw that Rodregas was also watching Doi’van.
 She thought he also recognized the danger of a Hellborn rage.
 Imeralda reached out to Rodregas first to try to get him to calm down and help manage Doi’van.
 Imeralda focused on their bond and looked him in the eyes and said, “Rodregas getting angry will not change things, let’s sit down and talk to the village elders.
 They are thankful for what we have done.
 They need payment for their risk, but they understand we have needs.” Rodregas nodded and seemed to be calming down until Jordaan spoke, “No, you made your agreement.

How can I possibly compete against the kinds of girls who'll continue throwing themselves at you for as long as you're breathing?"
 Anger managed to accomplish what all of the swallowing hadn't.
 The diatribe that'd started out nearly inaudible had grown in volume until by the end I was hissing loud enough the people closest to us turned around in curiosity.
 Alec calmly captured my wildly gesturing hands, immobilizing them with a casual strength that made me feel like a child.
 "Please don't do that."
 He continued on before I could open my mouth.
 "The fact you didn't date until recently doesn't mean you're some kind of nerd.
 Even if it did, that wouldn't matter to me.
 Also, other girls who may or may not find me attractive are irrelevant.

I was glad they weren't waiting until the day before the test to come in for help, but it was looking like tomorrow wasn't going to be any fun.

 Rachel met me on my way back to my table to gather up my books.
 "She left with Rick Anders."
 I mustered a grin.
 "Was my panic that obvious?"
 "No, I was just watching her to see who she had in her sights for the Ashure Day Dance.

Under these circumstances, the international community, through the UN, should have the right and accept the responsi bility to intervene appropriately.
 The need of the hour is not to undermine the legitimate right of nations to self-determination, but rather to protect that right by more clearly demarcating its legitimate boundaries against the highly visible challenges being posed by forces of disintegration and fragmentation from within.
 The current tendency for states to fragment along ethnic lines cannot be handled by any abstract principle of international law.
 It depends on the understanding and will of people.
 The evolution of larger, heterogeneous national units functioning under principles of equality is an outstanding product of civilization that should not and cannot be reversed without great damage to the general welfare of humanity.
 The only solution is to work constantly to educate the public in all countries to understand the benefits of national integration and international cooperation.
 The implications of this view will be endorsed by some and opposed by others.
 Acceptance must be fostered through education and discussion rather than unilateral forced initiative.
 Preventive Diplomacy, Peace Making and Peace Building
 The answers to the questions regarding national sovereignty and international responsibility will determine the scope of UN preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace building in years to come.

 “Arming you is as scary as giving a kindergartener a knife.” She gasped.
 “Yeah, well, I’m ignoring you now.” She huffed and turned around.
 “There you are!” Jason exclaimed as he crashed out of the trees, panting.
 His wavy hair was a deep red that framed his eyes but he didn’t seem to have noticed its color change or to care.
 He was wearing an all black layered tunic and pants with boots that looked as light as mine.
 If I didn’t know it was Jason, I would have taken a huge step backwards at his assassin-like appearance.
 “What’s going on?” he demanded, eyes flickering from each of us as he took in all of our strange appearances.

 I shivered because the ground was so cold and hard that it chilled me to the bone.

In democratic countries freedom of expression and exposure to independent media awaken people to expectation of a better life and encourage them to take initiatives that lead to prosperity.
 At the same time, the democratic tendency is strengthened substantially by rising standards of living.
 As democracies distribute political power, they also tend to distribute the benefits of science, technology, information and education, which are the essential building blocks of economic development.
 Democracies provide greater access to resources, permit greater social mobility, and encourage institutional innovation.
 Not surprisingly, today all of the high-income industrial nations, as well as the top 25 ranked nations on UNDP’s Human Development Index, are liberal democracies.
 In contrast, only eight of the 43 poorest nations have multi-party democratic political systems.
 Even among the poorest countries, democracy has served to protect the population from the worst scourges of war and poverty that have ravaged many authoritarian countries.
 Economist Amartya Sen was one of the earliest to observe that no country with a democratic government and a free press has suffered from famine during the last four decades.
 India, the world’s most populous democracy, suffered its last major famine prior to independence in 1943.
 Although a major famine threatened ten million lives in India during the mid-1960s, it was averted by the government’s emergency measures and timely launching of the Green Revolution.

An arrow tore right through his hand.
 The whip fell, the fire vanishing the second it left contact with Qurrah’s skin.
 A second arrow followed.
 The half-orc rocked backward, his brown eyes wide in shock, as the tip pierced deep into his throat.
 The healing potion fell from his hands and broke against a rock.
 He slid back, resting against a home as he gasped for breath.
 The elf grabbed the shaft of the arrow, and that sick anger filled his face.
 “How many of my kin died to your hand?” he asked.
 A twist of his hand sent spasms of pain all throughout Qurrah’s body.
 He coughed violently, and blood ran down his lips and neck.

From the taping session there’s a version of “I’m Not Your Stepping Stone,” which we used to use to warm up.
 It’s raw—actually not bad for all its rawness.
 Sometimes overcooking leads to worse performances.

 I’m not sure which concert it comes from but I’m guessing an early one.

“Stay with me.” I started to pull away and he reached up, placing his hands on either side of my face, feverish now.
 “Marry me, Lizzy.” I had long since gotten used to the name, but I wasn’t sure he was talking to me at first.
 It seemed ridiculous.
 I stopped myself from laughing, knowing from previous experience this would hurt him.
 I had come to realize he didn’t know what I was.
 He knew I was different, of course, knew of the magic, though I’d shown him nothing of my real power.
 But he didn’t understand I was an elf.
 I hadn’t explained, knowing it would do nothing but perplex his simple mind.
 He merely thought I was something special, extraordinary.
 But did he actually think I was human, marrigeable?

Fear v. Love
 While speeding on Interstate 5 north out of Sacramento past orchards and pastures, with long miles between the small towns, I think back to my talk with Toni, the part about suffering from panic attacks.
 During five of those hard years, while I taught in Chico, I often drove this highway to visit writer friends in San Francisco.
 This part of I-5 terrified me, with visions of a sudden attack that would deny me control over my mind or body, leaving me helpless and miles from the closest nurse or doctor.
 For no good reason except the fear of fear, my heart would race, my lungs and throat constrict, my hands become slick with sweat.
 I couldn’t run because I couldn’t breathe.
 I couldn't fight, because the enemy was me.
 The first time, a few years before, I landed at County Mental Health in San Diego.
 A doctor prescribed valium, which barely helped.
 For months I lived in abject fear.

I forget sometimes how much easier it is for you and Rachel to catch a chill.
 Let's get you inside where it's a bit more temperate."
 It seemed like such a waste, leaving the grotto after all the work that'd been put into transforming it, but Alec waved away my protests.
 He easily cradled me in one arm, while carefully picking up my painting with his free hand.
 A short time later, we were back inside the house and headed towards his room.
 Cuddled up against his chest with the familiar, warm tingle caressing my skin, my system apparently decided I was completely safe, and started shutting down.
 I was doing a fairly respectable job of hiding my drooping eyelids, but all my efforts were undone by the prodigious yawn that ambushed me as he set me down on the bed.
 "I'm not tired, I promise."
 His eyebrow arched in disbelief as I pulled him down onto the bed, and I found myself admitting the truth.

“When you tell someone to follow you, it usually means that you know where you're going.” “Not this time,” he said over his shoulder.
 The tunnel ended and opened up to the sky.
 For a second I thought we were back on the plain, but we weren't.
 The sky was blood red and a crescent moon was rising up.
 From the feeling of the air I knew we weren't underground anymore but I didn't know where we were.
 Skeleton trees were scattered to the sides.
 There were long hills ahead, the grass a light gray.
 “This place looks like it’s from a book about hell,” Seth said.
 “Where are we now?” I asked.
 He shook his head.

Qurrah endured it, keeping his hands at his sides.
 “I was so worried about you!”
 “Velixar is dead,” Qurrah said, eyeing Aurelia warily.
 “We know,” the elf said.
 “It is well to meet you again, Qurrah.”
 Qurrah stepped back from his brother, and Aurelia noticed his robes and frowned.
 “You should have left them.
 He was an evil man.
 Following in his footsteps will lead to a similar fate.”
 The half-orc said nothing.

“I am glad that you accepted my message,” he said to Seth and me.
 Then he turned to Emily and Jason and said, “Ah, it’s great to meet the other two.” He beamed at all four of us.
 “Hi,” Emily said, looking a little freaked out.
 “So now that you’re here, are we going to get a move on or what?” “Oh of course, follow me please.” He shuffled off and disappeared behind the statue.
 Jason raised an eyebrow.
 “Where is he going?” Emily sighed.
 “There’s only one way to find out.” She walked behind the statue.
 Seth, Jason, and I followed her.
 As soon as I was on the other side, I gasped at what I saw.
 In front of me was an archway.

The military have at their disposal scientific and technological resources which in many cases can be applied to environmental protection with the minimum of adaptation, such as information and monitoring systems that track changes in the atmosphere, in the oceans and on earth’s surface.
 These resources can be applied to environmental monitoring and impact assessment, protection of endangered species, quick response to disasters and accidents, energy conservation, and the minimization and management of waste.
 The appropriate role for the military in these various activities will depend on the country, the urgency of the circumstances, and the cost-effectiveness of military involvement compared with available alternatives.
 In some instances, it may be feasible to establish international ‘Earth corps units’, specially trained and equipped to carry out certain types of environmental protection and restoration, such as India’s eco-battalions, which seek to conserve the Himalayan habitat by restoring tree cover and constructing small dams and canals.

 The goals of peace, prosperity and fulfilment for every human being represent formidable challenges – intellectual, attitudinal, organizational and technological.
 We cannot hope to reach such lofty achievements if we waste and squander the precious and abundant resources – mental, psychological, social and material – placed at our disposal.
 A massive reduction in emphasis on weapons production and military establishments, made possible by recent political events and demanded by the pressing unmet needs of people everywhere, represents both a great opportunity and a considerable challenge.
 The opportunity is not only further to reduce the threat of war by reducing the capacity for waging war, but also to redirect and utilize for other purposes the resources now dedicated to war making and prevention.
 The challenge is to do so at a time when rising unemployment and economic stagnation in many countries make further cuts in the size of the military unpopular domestically.

Then we ran for our lives.
 The night Eric joined us, so did big Mike Beatty.
 He was about 6’6”, 280 pounds.
 We rode with a cabby to three motels.
 After the first, Eric said, “This is bad, Ken.
 I hate this.” At the second motel, he gave the girl half his money, for nothing.
 We were leaving the third place when he asked me, “Why do you do this?” "Excitement?"
 I guessed.
 Mike was sitting behind the driver’s seat.
 While the cabbie waited for an opening into the boulevard traffic, Mike leaned up close and growled, “It’s a good thing you don’t plan to get us roughed up, or else I’d have to pinch your head off.” The cabby muttered something in Spanish and made a face that seemed to say, “Go ahead, what do I care?” At an historic saloon called The Long Bar, Eric told me about all three prostitutes he’d talked to, where they came from, how large their families were, and he remembered most of their entire formal names.

There is a strong positive correlation between higher education and higher incomes.
 The employment rate for college graduates in the United States is 75 per cent versus 48 per cent for high school drop- outs; at the height of the recent recession, 3.2 per cent of college graduates were unemployed compared with 11.4 per cent of high school drop-outs.
 Only 57 per cent of 18-year-olds in the OECD countries are pursuing formal education.
 The Japanese built their highly competitive workforce by raising the educational attainments of the bottom half of their primary and secondary school population.
 Raising the minimum compulsory level of education, as Belgium did in the mid-1980s from 16 years to 18, slows the entrance of young people into the labour market, better equips them for employment and in creases the demand for teachers.
 Extending compulsory education by two years or doubling the teacher– student ratio in the United States could generate several million additional jobs in teaching.
 A national commitment to raise the minimum standard, the average level and the quality of education can act as a great medium-term stimulus to job creation.
 9.Continuous training: Technological development is dramatically speeding up the rate at which old skills become obsolete and new ones are needed.
 Education and training must become a life-long process for workers.
 In a number of countries, high levels of unemployment coexist with shortages of particular skills, reflecting significant mismatches between supply and demand for skills.

I don't belong here--I want to go home!"
 Her heart was beating wildly, and she was having a hard time catching her breath.
 The fear and panic that had faded with fatigue and the novelty of it all were suddenly back full force, and all she knew was that she was far from home and from everything she knew.
 "Calm down.
 Calm down, Marie."
 He sat down, drawing her into his arms.
 His embrace made her feel secure enough to swallow her fear.
 When her breathing had returned to normal, she pulled back to look into his eyes.
 "I want to go home."
 "OK."  He stroked her hair.

The failure rate of new businesses is extremely high in most industrial nations.
 In Italy, roughly 50 per cent fail in the first year.
 Of the more than 600,000 new business start-ups in the United States each year, 40 per cent close within 12 months, 80 per cent within five years, and 80 per cent of the remainder in the subsequent five years.
 Expanding programmes for management training, small business education and counselling, marketing assistance and financial management can bring down the failure rate dramatically.
 3.Voluntary part-timism: Increasing the flexibility of working hours will serve the interests of both businesses and workers.
 Encouraging voluntary part-timism by removing the artificial barriers to job sharing created by employment laws, social security tax laws, administrative procedures and trade unions would raise the morale and productivity of those who prefer to work less, while creating openings for many who are now without jobs.
 In the Netherlands, voluntary part-timism has been identified as the biggest single potential for creating new jobs, capable of reducing the country's unemployment by up to 50 per cent.
 Proportionately reducing working hours and salaries can spread the existing work more evenly over more people.
 Evidence suggests that reduced working time can raise productivity significantly.
 Extending vacation time and medical leave in the United States nearer to levels which the Europeans enjoy would create many more job openings.

“Feeling well?” I nodded.
 “I think I’d like to train again.” “That is probably a good idea.
 We’ll be leaving soon.” I didn’t know if I was that much better.
 “Don’t worry.

She giggled at the thought.
 Wondering if Rick had heard her, she glanced over at him.
 He hadn't moved.
 Raising her head, she leaned a little closer to him.
 He was asleep!
 She lay there for a few more minutes, but she was too restless to keep lying still, especially with no one to talk to.
 So at last she jumped up and ran into the waves.
 Rick woke up slowly with no idea of how long he'd been asleep.
 It had been an exhausting week, and he'd gotten less sleep than usual.
 Of course, he'd had much more fun than usual too, he thought with a lazy smile.

Something was wrong, the greater sigil was not becoming part of him, he was being made part of the sigil.

 He was unable to move and unable to breath and was trying to do anything to live.

"Now you sound like my mom."
 We rounded a corner before Brandon could say anything else and nearly ran into Britney.
 "Guys!
 Did you see the back door?"
 I could almost see the wheels turning in Britney's head.
 First she went red as she remembered she'd stranded me at school, then her eyes got a little wider as she realized it was still about five minutes too early for me to have arrived on the bus.
 Brandon's normal smile was back.
 "Yeah, Adriana noticed it almost as soon as we pulled up to the school."
 Her suspicions that Brandon had given me a ride into school satisfied, Britney managed a sickly smile and mumbled something about seeing us later as she disappeared around the corner.
 I managed to make it another twenty feet before I couldn't restrain my laughter anymore.

Chapter 23: The Where, When & Why of Drugs We talked to Brandon as often as he could and we kept in touch with the counselors weekly.
 Over the next two months we received calls from our son and his counselor as he was in the part of the program where he was assigned to come clean with his family, acknowledge his behavior, and confess to the many terrible things he had done.
 The calls were very hard on us because even though they were necessary, we felt like he was getting so much better and we were getting all this bad news about stuff in the past.
 We understood that this was a necessary part of his treatment; he needed to cleanse himself and ask for our forgiveness.
 At the end of every confession he would ask if we would accept him back into the family to which we always answered yes!
 Every time Brandon called he seemed more mentally clear.
 Brandon’s counseling had revealed several things that had caused him to bury himself in drugs and he was learning how to manage those painful experiences.
 One big event was when our son received a call from another friend of his while we were away on a family vacation.
 The friend told Brandon that his best friend, Tom, had been in a horrible car accident and was near death.
 Our son, like Tom, just sixteen years old, was hysterical, and we returned home immediately.

The answers to these questions are relevant both to the countries presently making the transition from centrally planned to market economies in Eastern Europe and to poorer developing countries striving to achieve food security.
 Nations accord special status to their agricultural sector for several reasons.
 Continuous supplies of food are absolutely essential to the welfare of the population.
 Food prices are extremely sensitive to changes in the supply of foodstuffs.
 Even a small increase or decrease in supply can lead to a very wide fluctuation in prices.
 A bumper harvest can depress prices to the point of bankrupting large numbers of farmers.
 A poor harvest can send food prices soaring beyond the purchasing power of large numbers of people.
 Buffer stocks, subsidies and incentives are used to protect agriculture from sharp price fluctuations.
 Al though the principles of free trade argue that countries should produce only those items in which they possess a competitive advantage and procure the rest from overseas, few nations are willing to entrust their food supply entirely or even substantially to foreign parties.
 For decades Japan maintained trade barriers to keep the price of rice at more than six times the international level in order to protect and preserve domestic rice producers; the US government exports subsidized wheat; and the European Community sells subsidized milk powder and butter internationally at prices up to one-third below the domestic level.

Chevelle’s voice was barely audible as he spoke to his visitor in a formal tone.
 “Ruby.” Ruby?
 Before I could stop myself, I was at the door peering through the frame.
 A tiny crack of light allowed me about three-quarters of Chevelle’s back and all of his guest.
 Ruby.
 She looked to be a little shorter than me, a little smaller, but seemed larger somehow.
 I thought I knew why.
 Around her petite face, by some means both wicked and charming, was a mane of deep crimson hair flowing in curls.
 I considered her name, given that mass of hair, but any sympathy disappeared as she reached out a hand toward Chevelle.
 There was something sinful about it, the way her hand turned seductively in the simple task of retrieving the stone from him.

The jeans were mundane, perfect, but completely normal for all that they were snug in all the right places and loose everywhere else.
 The shirt, unbuttoned in his haste to follow me, was also perfectly normal, entirely believable.
 Everything else, however, was too surreal to really grasp.
 The sculpted stomach and chest were exactly like I'd secretly imagined they would be, but my gaze was pulled instead up to the massive bandage covering most of Alec's shoulder.
 The bandage alone should have told me I hadn't been hallucinating, but the fragments of memory didn't coalesce until I saw his eyes.
 The amazing, pale blue eyes were the final, poetic piece of evidence threatening to shred my sanity.
 I'd never really liked Alec, but I never suspected he was an actual monster.
 It was too much to process so quickly.
 When Alec took a careful step towards me, all I could think of was that I'd just seen those same eyes hovering above bloodstained fangs.
 I shrank back away from him, and saw his face go from calm to expressionless in a barely detectable flicker.

 “We only train them with commands for the imps.

 “I haven’t learned animal magic.” His lip pursed, one brow dropping low, the same strange look he’d given the first time I’d mentioned learning magic.
 “Just feel it, Elfreda.” I ignored the slight annoyance that Chevelle must have told him my full name.
 “I don’t understand,” I told him.
 “You don’t learn magic,” Steed said.

 Extending vacation time and medical leave in the United States nearer to levels which the Europeans enjoy would create many more job openings.
 Work or job sharing is not an ultimate answer in itself, but it can have a beneficial short-term impact, allowing time for longer-term measures to take effect.
 As a minimum, governments should remove the artificial barriers to job-sharing created by employment laws, administrative procedures and trade unions.
 Social security tax systems should also be modified to remove the in-built bias that increases the taxes of those who hold multiple, part-time jobs, rather than one full-time job.
 Such constraints limited part-time jobs to around 10 per cent of the total in Belgium, France, Italy and Spain compared to around 25 per cent in Britain and Denmark.
 4.Modify tax policies:The present income and payroll tax system raises the real cost of labour relative to other resources, such as capital and energy, and thereby discourages job creation.

“We will return one in the morning.” Rodregas smiled and nodded and pulled the two swords out simultaneously.
 He was starting to think his new body was ambidextrous, equally comfortable with both hands.
 That could prove useful, but would require some additional training to take full advantage of.
 “Actually, since I was kicking your ass barehanded, even with a knife in my belly, how about this: I won’t kill the bunch of you if you keep your distance and leave my camp at first light?” Rodregas’ tone was casual.
 “And, if you ask nicely, I will even leave you a few supplies to get to the nearest town if you promise not to tell anyone that you saw me.
 And you will promise that in the name of the All-Father, or you will die at my hand.” Rodregas did not smile now, nor did they.
 “So you think you could kill all of us?
 Put your sword down now!” demanded Audrian.
 Rodregas stepped forward and buried just the tip of his right-handed short sword into Audrian’s chest, hitting the ribs but not shoving the blade through.
 Audrian gasped in surprise and fell back.

The entire village must have known I was bound, known I couldn’t perform magic, as they sat and watched me try.
 Sending me to Junnie for lessons, allowing Evelyn to taunt me without recourse, giving me the blame for everything that happened.
 Because they expected me to turn.
 The horses slowed to a stop, irritating me further.
 I didn’t even have control over that.
 Chevelle stepped down and started a fire.
 When he walked away, I recalled what he had said earlier in the day, that you could stop someone’s heart.
 It hadn’t occurred to me that might be how he killed his prey.
 He made his way back over the scrubby brush, two small rabbits in hand.
 He dropped them and a branch covered in fat, blood-red berries by the fire, and I posted myself on the edge of an uneven rock to watch.

 My laugh had a touch more hysteria in it than I'd meant to let slip through.
 Brandon didn't look at me like I was losing it though.
 "You're not the only one to realize she's dangerous, it's just that Alec's family has a lot of influence, and so far she's avoided doing anything they couldn't cover up."
 I drew a deep breath and nodded.
 "Okay, I don't remember exactly what she said, but she was mad at the other girl, Lucy.

He is hated by the knighthood, but he was a great warrior, the kind that we have to be able to face if we fight the Immortalists.” Rodregas responded.
 “We can’t be afraid of the competition.
 I may die, but if I win I can earn a greater sigil, maybe even bring you into the chamber as my servant.
 If both Doi’van and I had a greater sigil, we would be much more likely to survive the upcoming battles,” Rodregas said.
 “We would still get spitted like a pig to the roast without decent armor,” said Doi’van, “but as the Gods have yet to provide the armor, we will show these human squires the armor of our faith and the armor of our courage.
 I just don’t like having to watch you fight such battles and not be able to fight myself.” growled Doi’van.
 “Yeah, what he said,” Imeralda stated, ”I wish I could do the bow competition for you.
 I could get you five points there even with a regular bow, otherwise I am happy to watch you big boys show how tough and strong you are.” Rodregas smiled at Doi’van’s and Imeralda’s courage even though their personalities were opposites.
 Imeralda was as light hearted as Doi’van was thoughtful.

“You are cold,” he stated.
 “Don’t deny it; you’re shaking like a leaf.
 Wait I don’t like that analogy, you’re shaking like a mole rat.” “Do mole rats shake?” I asked.
 He rolled his eyes and wrapped an arm around my shoulder.
 We sat there in silence and I leaned on his shoulder.
 We both stopped shivering as we stared at the sky.
 “Seth, I’m scared,” I whispered.
 “What happens if something goes wrong?” “Nothing will go wrong,” he said fiercely.
 “I won’t let it happen.” I closed my eyes.
 “I keep seeing what happened that night.” “It’ll go away,” he said.

 "How does the airplane get in the air?"
 They were on the plane waiting for takeoff.
 Marie was in a window seat, squeezing Rick's hand as she looked out the window.
 "The plane goes really fast down the runway until the air lifts it."
 "It's so big and has all these people in it.
 How does it stay in the air without falling?"
 "I don't know much about aerodynamics."

He also handed Audrian a few of his coins.
 It wasn’t much, but it would get them started; they were lucky he was being so generous.
 Rodregas felt he owed them, and if he had been in their place he would have tried to kill Ravenhurr.
 Clearly the three human men were eager to get started back to the main road.
 He noticed that the Hellborn Doi’van and Imeralda seemed to be hanging back.
 As the three men started to head down the road Doi’van walked up to Rodregas and stated, “I would rather travel with you.” That was it; he just stood there like some huge tree after that simple statement.
 Audrian seemed as surprised as he was.
 They both spoke at the same time, their thoughts strangely in agreement.
 “Are you crazy?” asked Audrian at the same time as Rodregas said, “That is crazy.” “Look, the Guild will be after me,” Rodregas stated.
 “It will not be safe to travel in my company,” he added.

I stared at the paper, the question swirling in my mind.
 Who did he mean?
 “Now what did the dwarf tell you, Seth?” she asked.
 “He said, ‘You won’t stop him, little warrior.’” He frowned at the last part.
 Emily added, Toad Dwarf told Seth, “You won’t stop him, little warrior.” Does this mean he’s powerful?
 “Did you have to add the ‘little warrior’ part?
 It makes me sound weak.” Seth complained.
 “I did because we need all the facts.
 It’s obvious the dwarf was trying to make you sound weak anyway.
 Now what did he tell you, Jason?” “He said, ‘He will destroy all half-lings.’ What’s that supposed to mean, anyway?” Jason said.

 But as the fog began to lift, she could tell that she was still in 2011.
 The house to her left didn't look like any house she'd ever seen before yesterday.
 And she was no longer in a garden--she was walking across a lawn.
 She wanted to keep walking, but with the fog disappearing and no garden in sight, she was afraid it was useless.
 She turned around, eyes down as she headed back to Rick's house.
 How would she get back?

I had this record player, you know, with the lid and the swivel arm made of plastic, and a stack of 45s, some I bought at Corondolet in a sealed stack—you know?
 Five 45s for $1, and you could only see the top one.
 And it would be something halfway tempting, some Jerry Lee or The Cascades.
 But the others were groups you’d never heard of.
 But, that didn’t matter to me.
 I listened to everything.
 At that time everything was equal—my taste was still developing.
 So I was indiscriminately borrowing from everywhere, from any 45 that came across my little portable spinner, it was all equal, you know, it was all music, Lee Hazlewood or Howlin’ Wolf or Roy Orbison or Serge Gainsbourg.
 I remember I had this Terry Callier 45, “Look at me Now,” and I thought it was every bit as good as “Rock Around the Clock” or the Sun stuff or “Lemon Tree”—(laughs)—I didn’t know, man,  I mean it all seemed good to me.
 And I taught myself to play it all.

“Seth, I think you know what I want.” “Never!” The faery chuckled and I saw his greasy hair bounce up and down.
 “You seriously think that I assumed you would walk away with me?
 Oh, I had no intention of it being this simple.” I knew what he meant, and I yanked my bow off.
 I pulled my arrow out and notched it, aiming it at Kojas’ back.
 “Jazell, wait!” I didn’t turn around as Emily and Jason skidded to a halt behind me.
 I didn’t drop my bow either.

 Months later, Harruq awoke at the dawn, jerking upward and uttering a sharp gasp.
 A constant cry of danger rang in his ears.
 A quick survey showed he slept alone in their small shed, his brother missing.
 “Qurrah?” he dared ask.
 “Outside,” came Qurrah’s muffled reply.
 Harruq stretched, pushed away a plank of wood from the window, and climbed out.

It was a time of excess, for one thing, and for another, man, listen to that cut.
 It smokes.
 It cooks like little else on vinyl at that time, except for maybe some Cream, some Who.
 Maybe “Train Time,” maybe that incredible mélange Townshend put together for Live at Leeds.
 And, let me add here, that I got a call from Pete, it was in, oh, 1969 or so, and he’d gotten a copy of the album—God knows where—and he was agog at that cut, he asked me how I got the distort sound on my guitar.

If a book proves difficult, like Kierkegaard's Works of Love, all the better.
 My brain needs the exercise.
 Since reading and wrestling with Brother Lawrence, I often I feel like a wanderer whose spirit longs for home, the way I felt upon waking long ago in the Desert Inn from a vision of heaven.
 I tried to drop writing a couple priority levels, but that move didn't work.
 As usual, a few days without writing, gloom started to creep in.
 So I boosted writing back to number four.
 Housekeeping rose a level, because I've discovered, like Olga did, that chores can be a swell time for contemplation.
 If you come to visit, you might find me scrubbing a floor, or dicing beats, while listening to my I-pod.
 If I don't notice your approach and look as if I'm talking to myself, don't worry.
 I'm probably communing with Jesus, though he may be in disguise.

 Some people, some back-biting curs, I might say, said I got stupider, that my two “California” LPs represent some kind of nadir for rock music, right up there with Self Portrait and “My Love” and Satanic Majesties Royal Request or whatever the hell that thing is called.

 You write because you’ve got to man, because it’s your guts that are hurting, your guts that are in need of something.
 And you’re gonna find that thing, even as it keeps receding from view, even as the more you go forward the farther away it gets.

They dared to hope.
 As they ran, a strange sight met their eyes.
 In the distance were hundreds of bodies lined in perfect formation.
 They held no torches or lanterns.
 The wind shifted, and upon its gentle flow the stench of death came to them.
 The villagers slowed, fearfully eyeing the line.
 The stars were bright, and there was no mistaking that something was amiss.
 They were no soldiers.
 Only a scattered few wore armor.
 Still, they stood in the straight lines of a disciplined army.

Rodregas had an idea about how he wanted to start this new day.
 “Doi’van, Imeralda,” he said getting their attention.
 “I have not told you much about my past.
 But, as a teenager I served as a squire of the knightly Order of the Soaring Heavens”.
 At their nod he added,”I was never raised to knighthood, as I had neither the noble lineage nor the martial prowess.
 My life as a squire was a good life, one I appreciated more afterwards than when I was living it.
 Both the knights and the squires always started off the day with a prayer to the Celestial Gods.
 I have not done this in over forty years, but I am going to start again and I would like you to join me if you would.” The two looked at Rodregas, they were very different people, but they both seemed unsure what to say to his request.
 Finally, Doi’van nodded at Imeralda and said to Rodregas, “It has been too long since I have prayed as well, it would be good for the soul.
 Please lead us in prayer.” Imeralda did not say anything, but she nodded and followed the two of them outside.

 My thoughts were twisting, getting out of control.
 They’d be hunting us all down now.
 They would kill us.
 That was why I needed training.

 My brain must have been working overtime in an effort to block out the fact I was now another year older.

 I blew out the candle, and turned to leave again, but didn't even get to take a step this time.
 "Hold on there.
 Do you always skip breakfast now?"
 Mom had somehow spontaneously developed these weird memories featuring me as a morning person.
 I personally couldn't remember a time when I'd actually liked getting up.

I made a mental note to tell Emily about this.
 That is, if all of us didn’t die first.
 They screeched in anger and I felt their eyes on me.
 Every single one was full of burning hatred.
 But I ignored the feeling and focused on Seth.
 His eyes locked on mine as he wheezed and he sent me a clear message, Help.
 Not that I needed his permission anyway, it's just Seth never asked for help.
 I, again, suddenly knew the syphon's weakness but I didn't know why or how.
 I could sense some dark black area on the neck just like a target dot.
 I stabbed it and the creature gave a dying hiss, falling to the ground too.

She noticed me looking.
 “Well, Frey, I feel like I know so much about you.” She smiled slyly at Chevelle.
 “But you know so little of me.
 Let me tell you a few things, since we will be traveling together.” I felt my head jerk to find Chevelle, not believing what I had just heard.
 Ruby continued without pause.
 “I’m sure you’ve heard by now I’m an amalgamation, a half-breed.” She said the last part with distaste and glanced at Steed.
 “I will give you a short version of events so when the subject comes up—and believe me, someone will ask—you are not overcome by curiosity and forced to seek less than honorable venues to discover the facts.” I chose to ignore the jab about my eavesdropping.
 “My mother was a power-hungry wench seeking notoriety.
 She was an elemental fairy and, like me, sported a fine head of red hair.” She ran a hand under the curls for emphasis.
 “She heard a story one day of a mixed-species birth and got it in her head she could breed a more powerful magic.

I opened my mouth to say that we already were when he vanished.
 Dragged away was my guess.
 My legs shot with pain.
 I heard Emily yell the first curse words I’ve heard her say in a while.
 I spotted her red arm just before my body felt like fire.
 I closed my eyes and blacked out.
 I didn’t really black out but that’s what I thought at the time.
 I opened my eyes to find I was sitting on the ground next to my sleeping body.
 I saw Emily sitting there, saying nothing for once.
 Something fell off my back and I picked it up.

You held me back as my mother died.
 You held me and made me watch her die.” I could almost taste the acid in my voice.
 He was still backing away, holding his hands in front of him palms out.
 A wordless hiss escaped my throat as I felt the fire coursing through me light in my hands.
 He would burn for this.
 Burn.
 I was standing now, walking step for step toward him as he backed away.
 He said nothing, his face calm as the fire flared and I raised my hands to strike.
 And then everything went black.
 That was when I heard the chanting.

I grunted something noncommittal as we turned the corner.
 It probably wouldn't have been good enough to save me from having to actually say something, but Brandon was leaning against a wall.
 "I thought it much safer to stay in one place and wait for you rather than wander around and risk getting knocked down."
 I felt my skin flush with embarrassment.
 It was fairly gentle as teasing went, but I hated how my skin looked when I was blushing which meant I blushed more than any two other people.
 Not only that, I couldn't ever come up with anything good to say when someone teased me.
 Brandon seemed to sense my unease, and flashed another gentle smile.
 "I just wanted to find out if you had a way home tonight after you finished up with your math stuff."
 Britney was almost jumping up and down.
 "Oh, don't worry, Brandon, I'll give Adri a ride home.

 He turned to her, reading trust and honesty in her eyes.
 Without a word he slid his arms around her, burying his face in her neck as he hugged her.
 She coaxed him into the water, where they swam and floated on gentle waves.
 He stayed in until his stomach was rumbling loudly enough to frighten the fish, and then he convinced Marie to leave the water by promising her a hot dog.
 It was a treat she rarely had.

Would Cassie hate me a little less because we were both potentially in Jasmin's crosshairs, or would she hate me all the more because I'd seen her humiliated and forced to back down?
 I finally finished the little can that represented my lunch.
 I wasn't particularly hungry, but I couldn't lose much more weight without Mom dragging me into a doctor.
 Besides, it gave me an excuse to try and ignore the fact that half of the people in the room seemed to be staring at me when they thought I wasn't looking.
 I finally worked up enough courage to look across the cafeteria as I peeled the label off of the can.
 Alec wasn't at his usual place, but Brandon was at his normal table, surrounded by a smaller than normal group.
 The discussion looked way more intense than normal, and seemed to center around him and Cassie.
 It was all so crazy.
 Two weeks ago my life had revolved around my inability to think of certain things without collapsing.
 That hadn't changed, but now there was a distinct possibility Jasmin was going to hurt me just to ensure I stayed silent.

He turned the key, put the car in reverse, and backed out of the garage.
 She gave him directions, trying not to notice how different all the houses in the neighborhood looked.

 She jumped out before he could stop completely and ran up to the front door.
 Rick dashed after her, grabbing her arm before she could open the door.
 "We'd better knock."
 "But this is my house."
 "Let's ring, just in case.

He was on his knees, his silk outfit stained by grass and dirt.
 Blood ran from where Harruq had broken his nose.
 “Name a price, name it, anything, just name it!”

 All we want is you.”
 The man paled.

I started to slowly limp back to my body but Seth just disappeared from my side.
 He has this annoying skill to be able to just return to his body without having to be near it, which wasn’t fair when he wasn’t the one injured.
 I, however, had to stiffly make my way to my dormant human body.
 Once I was near it, I closed my eyes and the wind picked back up.
 My body felt hot and cold simultaneously as I returned.
 I reopened my eyes and stood up, stretched, and grabbed my bag.
 My back sent a chorus of cracks cascading upwards as I straightened myself.
 I raised the side of my shirt to find the thin, red scratch marks.
 Any injuries I get in my hunter form I have when I become human again, just not as severe.
 I quickly ran my fingers over the darker, thicker marks on my shin, the skin sore and purple.

 As the two brothers left, another soul traveled in the dark.
 He made not a sound as he moved.
 Any attempts at tracking his passage would be utterly futile, for not a single blade of grass remained bent when his foot stepped away.

He released her and then squirted her.
 Laughing again, Marie twirled in the spray.
 "This is fun!"
 Rick shook his head, grinning.
 "What am I going to do with you?"
 Dropping the hose, he went to hug her.
 "You're absolutely incorrigible."
 "Who, me?"
 She leaned back to smile up at him.
 "Is it my fault you have all these wonderful toys?"

As she slid the last book into her backpack, Albert stepped away from my desk with another smile.
 I flipped over to the next chapter and started in on functions as Rachel exited out a corner door I hadn't noticed before.
 I saw a flash of the stunted, brown vegetation that the locals called grass before the door swung back closed.
 Suppressing an urge to just surrender and go outside until Britney finished up, I got started.
 The roar of some kind of high-performance engine a few seconds later almost changed my mind, but my native stubbornness kicked in before I let the thought get out of hand.
 The subject matter was harder than graphing, but I persevered, and managed to make it through all fifteen problems without resorting to the red side of the card.
 Of course Albert did stop by to see if I was having any difficulties, but since I didn't summon him, he couldn't read anything into it.
 When Britney stomped over and asked if I was done, I considered telling her I needed ten more minutes.
 Her being an attention hog didn't justify me being petty though.
 I just nodded instead and packed up my stuff.

I told him I thought this was a Scientology-based program, to which he replied that, while this was a common misconception, they did not favor or push any religion.
 A shame, he stated, as this keeps some people away from a very good rehabilitation center where everyone is allowed to practice whatever religion they wish.
 My wife and I had attended Alanon meetings back home and we found them very religious in structure so we expected some Scientology leanings out here in the desert, but found no evidence of any.
 Our son proudly toured us around the grounds and introduced us to everyone we passed.
 He was so enthusiastic and so different.
 Although he was excited to see us, he was calm and collected.
 He was respectful to all and excited to show off his family, he seemed to know everyone.
 We met many of the people who we spoke with on the phone and got to put their faces with their names.
 Every worker we met was a recovering drug addict and a one-time student of Narconon.
 People from all walks of life, from all over the country and all ages; it was a mosaic of America’s addicts trying to change their lives.

People would come and go as they purchased their cocaine all day and all night.
 The big buyers would be treated to a sampling right out of the giant pile.
 Thomas would drag out a “rock” of cocaine from the massive pile and crack it open as if he was cutting a diamond.
 The story of its origin and quality were described as if you were listening to a reading from a science fiction novelist.
 To watch these people hang on every word of his bullshit was sickening to me.
 Their wild eyes and grinding jaws were just the physical part of their bizarre behavior.
 People would hover next to windows, peeking out every few seconds, check the locks on the same doors over and over again as their paranoia increased with every line they snorted.
 There was no deterring Thomas from his occupation, as he believed himself invincible—as all drug dealers do.
 I had watched other old friends get hauled off to jail and I didn’t want the same for my brother.
 One afternoon, I called Thomas and a strange voice picked up the phone.

"You're in our way, half-breed."
 I felt Alec's grasp tighten slightly, but considering the crushing strength he was capable of, it was the closest thing imaginable to a non-response.
 Brandon was coming up behind Vincent, as Alec reached up and placed his own hand on Vincent's chest, with another, stronger flash of power.
 The ripple of skin and bone was so quick for a second I couldn't believe what I was seeing, but there it was.
 Alec's hand and fingers had elongated, turning into a hairless replica of the deadly claw that'd terrified me just a few days before.
 Vincent's bulk was such that it screened Alec's movements from passersby, as those razor-sharp claws sank just the barest distance into his chest.
 Alec spoke for the first time, and the even tone of his words was a stark contrast to the winds of power that seemed almost ready to throw me across the hall.
 "You forget yourself, mutt.
 As the leader of another pack, I'm due more respect than that.
 Should you or your dominant wish to push things further, I guarantee that your heart will decorate the floor before he can come to your aid."

We had stopped to camp when, over dinner, Steed announced he would be leaving us the next morning, heading east.
 His easy humor had become a comfort to me during the long days, our quiet evenings a pattern I knew I would miss.
 The disappointment must have shown on my face.
 He reached a hand up and brushed my hair behind an ear.
 “Don’t worry, sunshine, I will see you again.” I smiled a little and he winked at me.
 Chevelle stiffened at my side as he often did when Steed touched me so casually, and I couldn’t help but think of being alone with him after tonight.
 My stomach tightened and suddenly in comparison the mountains didn’t seem like such a big deal.
 The next morning Steed said goodbye privately to Chevelle and then came to where I stood with the horses, stroking one’s neck.
 “You’ll remember me, butterfly?” I smiled in return.
 “Always.” “Yes, well, at least as long as he’s yours.” He patted the horse.

She made herself focus her mind on her parents as she wandered through the garden.
 She missed talking to her mother.
 She knew her mother would understand about Davis.
 All she wanted was for Marie to be happy.
 She'd always been nice to Davis, but she'd never treated him like a son.
 But she'd love Rick.
 Rick was so warm and funny, and her mother would feel comfortable with him.
 She stopped, squeezing her eyes shut.
 She couldn't stop thinking about him.
 Even when she thought about her family, Rick somehow surfaced in her mind.

He did not look at how high he had to go, but instead simply started to climb.
 The climb took far longer than he hoped and he could not see Imeralda as he climbed.
 He was finally getting close to the first of the branches of the tree when he heard Doi’van yell.
 “Rodregas, what in the name of the Celestial Winds are you doing?” He paused in his climb, his toes caught in the bark.
 Rodregas could feel the wetness of blood on his toes and he felt like he was going to slip at any moment.
 He breathed deep and yelled, “I am climbing the damn ‘One Tree,’ what does it look like?
 Now, shut up before I fall.”  He continued his climb, finally reaching a branch.
 The branch was on such a scale that he had to climb the branch coming up its side.
 The bark of the branch was smoother and offered less of a grip.
 Finally he got to the top, which was broad and actually rather cup-like against the main trunk.

Harruq tightened his grip on his wrist and pulled him along.
 The terrain sloped beneath them as they climbed a hill.
 Another quick shift and they were stumbling down that same hill.
 The cold hand vanished.
 The cloud dissipated.
 Before him, standing with his arms crossed, waited Velixar.
 Qurrah stunned his brother by falling to one knee and bowing his head.
 “Greetings, master,” Qurrah said.
 “I have brought him as you asked.”
 Delighted, Velixar grinned as he surveyed the tall, muscular half-orc.

This was worse than my fear of rollercoasters.
 “Calm down,” Seth said to me.
 “You’re not going to fall-” “What do you mean, Seth?” I said in a panicked voice.
 “We’re freaking falling right now!” Emily looked at us and she tried to hide the fear in her face.
 “The dragon is going to pull its wings around us to protect us from falling but it’s going to make us fall faster.
 Make sure you hold on to something or get in the center.” Seth pressed himself against me and we leaned closer to the dragon’s back.
 Jason tucked his arms under him and Emily pressed next to him.
 Then, as if on cue, the dragon tucked its great wings over us, blocking out the sky and we began to really fall.
 I screamed louder and sunk deeper into Seth, trying to forget that we were falling at about 90 miles per hour without a parachute.
 Every second felt like an hour.

When the ground collapsed, it must have carried us here.” “That stinks,” I said.
 “Are we stuck here?” “Not unless you know a way to grow wings with nothing but dirt.” I stood up and tried to rake the dirt out of my hair.
 “We're stuck here.” Seth sighed in frustration and brushed his blue  hair.
 He fluffed it up but the dirt was still stuck in globs.
 I rolled my eyes at his attempts.
 I turned around to see an entrance.
 I walked over and bent down.
 There seemed to be some kind of sign or symbol.
 It was two circles with a sword through the center of both.
 “Seth, look!” I said and pointed to it.

I’ve been to plenty of sleepovers at Emily’s, so my parents didn’t mind.
 Plus, our parents were close and Emily’s family was practically an extension of our own.
 We rode over to her house and parked our bikes in the garage.
 We knocked on the door and a woman answered.
 Emily’s mom was short, small and bony.
 Her light brown hair was almost blonde without any gray in it.
 The woman definitely did not look her age at all, and she was still as beautiful as I imagined she was in her youth.
 She smiled warmly at us, her smile a reflection of Emily’s.
 “Hello girls, come in.

I closed my eyes, feeling a strange tiredness come over me.
 I barely heard Seth mumbled, “I don't like our situation at all.” That night, I had the weirdest dream.
 I was standing on a dark cliff, the eerie moon high in the sky.
 The wind whipped at my hair, causing me to see the green strands in front of my eyes.
 The cold nipped at my cheeks and nose, which I tried to rub back to warmth.
 I stood at the edge of the cliff and gasped when I looked down.
 Underneath me, hundreds of monsters gathered around a fight.
 I couldn’t see who was fighting inside because a swamp troll blocked my view, but I knew it was brutal the way they whooped at a screech of pain.
 I wanted to close my eyes and look away, but I was so curious to see what was going on, that I couldn’t.
 The crowd parted to reveal the scariest and most hideous thing I’ve ever seen.

Marie sighed, wishing she could tell her mother everything.
 But she'd think that Marie had been so traumatized that she'd lost her grip on reality.
 "I wasn't hurt or starved.
 In fact, I was treated very well."
 She pressed her lips together.
 "I accidentally ended up far away from home and couldn't get back.
 I met someone who took care of me and tried to help me.
 We finally found a way."
 "This friend--he was a man?"
 "Yes."

Or maybe the cause was the sight of a dancer on the stage beside the bar.
 She was naked except panties sagged around her knees.
 I thought, the babe with auburn hair could be here in her place, if instead of having folks who were churchgoing gringos she had gotten born where I imagined this stoned, lost and weepy dancer had, as the fifteenth child of someone who lived in a hut beside a brown river.
 When a fellow vacated his bar stool, I excused myself from the table and moved there.
 I ordered another shot of tequila, and stared at the mirror behind the liquor shelf, wondering if I looked any different than before I surrendered to Jesus.
 I couldn’t spot a single feature that appeared more saintly or pure.
 I felt no more likely to hand over my jacket to whomever asked, let alone to throw in my shirt.
 The only change I recognized, I felt more confounded than ever.
 Someone had told me, when you drink tequila, make sure you count the shots.
 So I kept count.

It came back to me then.
 I dropped into a chair, my head falling into my hands to cover my face.
 Ruby started to say something, but Chevelle cut her off.
 “Won’t you offer your guest breakfast?” She sniffed.
 “Lunch maybe.” A plate of food landed on the table in front of me with a slap.
 “Thank you,” I managed.
 I was hungry, despite the embarrassment.
 I grabbed the plate and started eating.
 Ruby and Steed were sitting across from me.
 She was reclined, her bare legs showing where the material of her skirt was pulled to the side.

But she couldn't stay here.
 The thought of never going home, of never seeing her parents or brother or Tom-- A sob caught in her throat, and she squeezed her eyes shut.
 She wanted to go home, but when she left Rick, her heart would break.
 Would she be trading one misery for another?
 CHAPTER TEN
 Marie dressed slowly the next morning.
 She hadn't felt such an ambivalence about her walk since .

“No, I'm not that kind of cold.” She put the little flame out.
 “Ah, I know what you mean,” she said and hugged me.
 “I'm feeling the same way.
 But don't worry, they,” she motioned to the boys, “don't have to know.” “They'll find out eventually,” I mumbled.
 “But that doesn't have to been now.
 I bet they must have some kind of fear themselves.” I shivered.
 “It's like going throw the bogey-man's home.” “He must not get a lot of visitors,” Emily commented.
 “I'm defiantly not coming over anytime soon.” Emily laughed and the boys stopped walking.
 The trees parted to reveal a rock ledge.
 I spotted a small cave, the entrance covered in thick, twisted bramble.

“I didn't ask for the power, Seth.
 But it did save our butts so I'm happy, I magically gained it.” “Well I hope I get some cool power too,” Emily said and stretched.
 “Whatever,” Jason said and twirled a knife in his hand.
 He seemed to go back to say-a-few-words-and-then-say-nothing-which-drives-everyone-crazy.
 Emily made a face at him.
 “Wow, thanks so much for the support, Jason.
 That speech was incredible.” Jason stuck his tongue out.
 “You're welcome.” “One day,” she mumbled.
 “One darn day...” “Emily, are you okay?” I asked.
 Her head shot up and she gave me a big smile.

This is one of the major reasons why expectations of a massive peace dividend have not been fulfilled.
 World military spending has not declined significantly because the competitive security paradigm remains intact.
 Steps being taken by the members of the European Union to build a truly cooperative security system indicate the right direction for the world as a whole.
 It is no wonder that the first such initiative comes in Europe, which has been the leader of thought for the past 500 years – from the birth of modern science and parliamentary democracy to nationalism, socialism and universal education – and which has been working for the past five decades to evolve a viable working model of fully democratic, voluntary supra-nationalism.
 Democratization of the UN: The phenomenal advance of Europe’s multi-dimensional unification is a clear indication that in future international institutions will play a more important role than national governments.
 But this can happen only to the extent that these institutions are living proponents of democratic functioning and individual freedom.
 Ten years ago ICPF called for the democratization of the United Nations by abolition of the veto power in the Security Council, induction of new members to make that body more representative, and establishment of democratically-elected representative government as an essential condition for membership or active participation in the UN system.
 The nexus between democracy and prosperity is undeniable.
 The democratic revolution that has so effectively penetrated Eastern Europe in recent years and extended its roots in other regions must be taken to its logical conclusion at the level of nations and at the level of international institutions.
 World Peace Army: The most far-sighted of ICPF’s proposals sought to evolve a practical mechanism to promote the objectives of cooperative security and democratic freedom.

She spends half of her time in a different universe entirely, and only occasionally worries about the same kinds of things as other parents."
 "Ah, a dreamer, but one who still freaks out when it comes to her daughter and boys.
 Maybe she was just struck by my obvious good nature."
 I shook my head as we pulled into the parking lot.
 "Please.
 You're just about everything she's worried about in a guy.
 Rich, handsome, popular.
 The only thing you could change to scare her worse would be to join the football team and be the star quarterback."

It didn’t seem as if I’d gone that far, only half a day following Chevelle and then this time on my own.
 The changes here made me anxious to see the North.
 I glanced at my palm once more.
 I thought I’d figured out most of the lines—creeks curving through the landscape, mountains a jagged ridge across the top—but there were still a lot of unanswered questions.
 My hand squeezed into a nervous fist, but I kept moving.
 I tried not to think about all that had happened—not Fannie or the trial, not Junnie and especially not Chevelle.
 I just kept putting one foot in front of the other.
 I couldn’t even imagine what lay in the mountains where I was heading, but there was no going back.
 I wasn’t tired anymore, not as I had been every day since I’d been using magic.
 But I forced those thoughts away, counting steps as I ran.

As much as I would have liked to just call it a day, another good effort added to what I'd done earlier would put me two or maybe even three days ahead of my personal schedule.
 With a sigh of resignation I found my place on the page again, and started sorting out another set of variables.
 Forty-five minutes later I'd nearly completed another two sections, and was more than ready for a breather.
 Sometime while I'd been studying, most of the kids had left.
 I hadn't expected all of them to stay until my shift started, but I'd expected more than the two or three I usually had.
 Only it didn't look like that was going to be the case.
 Apparently most of them hadn't been serious about learning the material--they'd just wanted to come to the lab, make a half-hearted attempt, and then leave secure in the knowledge that if they failed the test they could whine to their parents about how hard they'd worked.
 But Mom, I even went to the lab.
 It sort of made sense though.
 If they'd been serious about acing the test, they'd have been here every night for the last two weeks instead of trying to cram a few more morsels of knowledge into their heads at the last minute.

We're going to be late for class."
 I followed without a word, even more intrigued now.
 'Cool' people don't sweat tardiness and Britney really wanted to be cool.
 A slender, frumpy-looking woman looked up from her desk as Britney and I walked in.
 I held up my form, which she took without reading it.
 "No doubt something to ensure I know you're my newest student.
 Sit over there where you won't distract Britney from just how poorly she's doing in my class.
 There's an extra book on the shelves in the back."
 Britney rolled her eyes as she went to her assigned desk, but I suspected she was actually relieved we'd been split up.
 Mrs. Campbell didn't seem like the kind of teacher you could get away with ignoring, so I retrieved an algebra book from the back of the room and sat at my desk.

I was in a bed.
 A very nice bed.
 I looked up to see several people leaving.
 Steed?
 Grey?
 I fought panic as I wondered if they’d all made it.
 The worry throbbed in my head; it felt like my mind could splinter.
 I checked the faces close to me for stress but could see none.
 Ruby’s smile was soft.
 “How do you feel?” I was having trouble forming a simple answer.

There was a large man who forced me to do magic, testing me until I was on the brink.
 He was fierce and wore a long scar across his brow that touched his cheek.
 He kept his hair cropped short, not wanting to hide any part of the damage.
 And my mother, though my dreams gave her two names.
 Dark hair, blowing in the wind, arms outstretched, the pendant hanging at her neck glowing fiercely.
 Fire, flames, burning.
 And then water.
 Drowning.
 Over and over and over.
 It almost made the cliff dreams more bearable, to be away from the repetitive drowning.

Only three years later, 18 African nations could be classified as democratic and a number of others were in the midst of far-reaching political change.
 The peaceful end of apartheid in South Africa is one remarkable outcome of this process.
 There are even winds of change in the Middle East, where Jordan has recently shown the way by conducting free elections.
 The role of democracy in development would be even more compelling were it not for the apparently contradictory evidence posed by the recent experience of Russia and China.
 Russia hastened to introduce democratic reforms in the hope that they would lead to rapid economic advancement.
 China preferred to postpone political reforms until the economic transition was much further advanced.
 As an immediate result, China has the highest economic and employment growth rates among the nations of the world, while Russia has experienced three successive years of steeply declining national income.
 These differences are of vital importance, but they centre around the issue of the best strategy for the transition in human terms, not on the ultimate importance of democracy to continuous economic development.
 The opening up to foreign trade and investment, the spread of higher education which is essential to achieve global competitiveness and the rising living standards which the market system will generate – all serve to undermine the legitimacy and staying power of the single-party system.
 China has released a social movement that is rapidly shifting power from the Party to market-responsive institutions and special interest groups, which include wealthy entrepreneurs, provincial officials, workers and peasants.

She finally glanced up at me, smiling an easy smile.
 I looked nervously at my wrist.
 It was magnificent.
 A simple outline of a bird with outstretched wings marked the delicate skin at the base of my palm.
 Unbelievably tiny runes surrounded the bottom of its wings, making a pattern appear.
 I smiled as I praised her.
 “It’s beautiful.” One eyebrow shot up and she jumped from the bed, grabbing my wrist and pulling me with her.
 I hoped she hadn’t smudged the design.
 I checked it as soon as she stopped in front of her mirror and let my arm go.
 “And this.” It wasn’t a question.

And yes, we can most definitely go to one of the libraries.
 In fact, I believe you'll find the smaller one quite satisfactory.
 It has a copy of every textbook currently in use at your high school, in case you reconsider."
 There were more turns than I had any hope of ever remembering, but eventually we made it to a familiar-looking door.
 At a nod from Donovan I pushed it open, and then as the furnishings registered, I turned back around.
 "This is Alec's room.
 I couldn't possibly..." Donovan shook his head.
 "Young Mr. Graves instructed that you were to have every convenience.
 I'm sure that included access to what we all jokingly call the second library.
 Besides, this is where you'll find the copies of all your textbooks."

Chapter One Frey
 Crap!
 I stubbed my toe on a root, one of the pitfalls of living in a tree.
 It throbbed and I slammed the door in frustration as I left the tree.
 It only took a moment to realize what I’d done.
 I picked up the pace as Aunt Fannie’s curses came screaming through the closed door.
 She was determined not to let me forget what a burden it had been to take me in, even if it used every spare ounce of energy to do it.
 My mouth twisted, and I shifted into a run until I reached the little outcropping of rock on the west side of the village.
 I was still thinking about it when I slowed to climb through the tangle of brush in back of Junnie’s house, but once my fingers trailed the cool rock surrounding the structure, it fell away.
 When it felt as if I could breathe again, I rapped two quick knocks and then one loud knock on the small wooden door.

She winked and disappeared in a flash.
 I limped over to my body ignoring Seth’s yells to tell me to sit down.
 I felt the wind pick up and was whisked back to my normal self.
 I felt fine except for the fact it hurt to stretch my left side.
 I would probably be extremely stiff and sore tomorrow morning, but I was used to that feeling.
 We began to walk back towards the park when Jason stopped us.
 “Hey can Seth and I catch you guys later?
 We have something to do.” Jason grabbed Seth and they took off.
 Emily raised an eyebrow, “Should we be concerned?” “Nah they’re boys, let them do what they have to do,” I said with a quick sigh.
 While we were walking the boys appeared in front of us, holding something behind their backs.

The outcome of all great social transformations – of which the present instance ranks in magnitude and importance with that of the French Revolution and the movement which freed India and so many other former colonies from imperialism, economic exploitation and cultural domination – depends on the degree to which individuals and institutions within the society have been prepared to understand, accept and respond to the new environment ushered in by the transition.
 Two hundred years ago the people of France were ready to overthrow the old order but ill-prepared to create anything new, with the result that the old soon re-established itself and lived on for another century.
 It took India’s leaders more than four decades to prepare their people for freedom and it has taken another four to overcome the vestiges of colonial rule that prevented the country from releasing its energies for prosperity.
 Long after the foreign conquerors had left, colonialism lived on in the institutions of government and in the attitudes of the population.
 Decades of freedom and education were needed for the country to outgrow a sense of inferiority, a seeking for security, a feeling of submissiveness and complacency, and to acquire a sense of pride, ambition, high aspirations and expectations, a seeking for achievement, and a spirit of adventure and enterprise – and still the task is not complete.
 Development is like a chemical reaction that is determined by the variety and quantity of elements present and the conditions under which they are put together.
 If one essential element or condition is missing, a social transition like a chemical reaction may not take place at all.
 The absence of peace in war-torn Africa or democratic freedoms in former colonial nations, the absence of social stability or an entrepreneurial class, the absence of a functioning banking or educational system, the absence of the minimum necessary infrastructure for transportation and communication – any one of these may be enough to prevent transition until the deficit is made up.
 If even an inessential element or condition is missing, the process of transition may take much longer than would otherwise be necessary.
 Lack of information, lack of education, lack of necessary skills, lack of supportive laws or incentives or protection against losses – insufficiency in any of these areas may be enough to slow or delay the process of change by years or even decades.

He was alive, and in a stronger, younger body.
 With the physical essence of the lion now part of his new body, and the magic of the sorcerer Ravenhurr, he would be an extremely talented person.
 That everything had gone so well was simply a god-sent miracle.
 He had rescued the maiden and killed the sorcerer.
 Of course the man's soul and intellect had been destroyed and a lion from the realm of the gods itself had been destroyed.
 It was far from a perfect victory, but Rodregas knew there were never perfect victories.
 He had had more luck in the last half hour than in his entire downtrodden life.
 Then, the next revelation hit him; maybe the Celestial Gods had answered his prayers.
 He had promised the Gods that if he lived, it would become his sworn duty to take down the Immortalists.
 Rodregas’ new heart seemed to stop for a moment at that thought and a chill ran down his body.

Still, Aurelia was not one to judge by appearances, and what she had seen that night had seared her heart.
 Two soldiers beating Harruq bloody without cause or reason, Harruq who was so kind to her when they sparred, who brought her flowers and told her stories, who looked upon her like she was a goddess of light in his dreary world…
 Harruq drew his sword.
 It shook in his hand.
 Aurelia watched as if in a dream.
 She felt magic spark on her fingertips.
 Under no circumstances could she watch him.
 She couldn’t.
 Nor could she believe it.
 He was so kind to her, so kind.

Another seemed to join it, then another and another until the noise was unbearably loud.
 Sick, quiet laughter sounded all around us.
 It giggled and laughed in amusement, shrieking at us.
 The laughter stopped, but the rattle didn't.
 But whatever it was, it surrounded us.
 The four of us pressed together.
 “This is the prey?” a rake-like voice cackled.
 “This is nothing!” I saw Seth draw his sword and the rest of us readied our weapons.
 I gripped my bow so hard that I was afraid it might break in two.
 I heard more screechy laughter.

Eugene – GODZILLA!
 Jim – Alright, alright.
 Well you remember when Gene was calling people up at three in the morning and doing that evil laugh…
 Liz – Yeah, that got annoying…
 Jim – I know, he did it to me like 10 times.
 Liz – So?
 Jim – Finally I just snapped and told him that calling people and laughing like a maniac wasn’t evil, it was just annoying.
 Liz – What does that have to do with it?
 Jim – Well, he kept on badgering me and asking me how he could make it truly evil, you know Gene, once he gets something into his head he sticks with it until he gets it working, unless it almost kills him.
 Liz – Or until he gets beaten up.

 Johnny – And how do you plan to resist making a nuisance of yourself for the rest of your life?
 Jim – I would like to know that as well.
 How do you plan to keep to the strait and narrow?
 Eugene – I’ll find something else to concentrate on.
 Jim – Like what?
 Johnny – What could have such a draw to you to keep you out of trouble for more than fifteen minutes at a time?
 Eugene – First off I’ll actually pay attention to my school-work
 Johnny – I don’t think that will take enough of your time to keep you out of trouble, all those remedial courses you have can’t be too much of a challenge.
 Eugene - Maybe I’ll find a girlfriend or something, I heard that girlfriends take up a lot of time and energy.

Words
 A single word can change our lives.
 Some years ago, I began to think hard about the word "love" as in "God is love" and in a challenge Sylvia Curtis made.
 Sylvia was an invalid, and rather crazy, given to dark moods and paranoid notions.
 She was the mother of my best friend Eric.
 I had come to help with chores and listen to her rant about whatever injustices she had recently suffered.
 Her apartment was dingy and cluttered, mostly with books.
 Eric’s high school senior-class picture, blown up to poster size and framed, hung facing the entry door.
 As I entered, Sylvia's fierce green eyes taunted me.
 She demanded, “What’s the purpose of life?” “Give me a minute,” I said.

Jocks, check.
 Rachel and her sinister sidekick James, check.
 I smiled at Rachel and then flipped open my math book.
 Everything went just like normal, and promptly at five I closed my binder and started stuffing books into my backpack.
 I looked up to find Rachel standing in front of my table.
 "Are you ready?
 James had to leave early, but don't worry, we've still got a ride home."
 I think I managed to keep the disappointment off of my face.
 Rachel at least didn't seem to notice.
 Somehow I'd lost track of the fact that it was a Wednesday, and Brandon therefore wouldn't be taking me home.

Pigpen’s gone.
 Jim, Abbie, sweet Timmy Hardin.
 Was it the same spirit in the night that whisked away all these mortal souls?
 I don’t know.
 I only tell stories.
 Buddy got his first musicmaker, a ukulele, when he was a sapling, six years old, a first-grader at Idlewild Elementary.
 He hung onto that uke as if it was his lifeline, time and time again having it taken from him on the playground where he would serenade a few curious classmates with his bewailing renditions of old Hank Williams songs.
 The end of most schooldays found little Buddy in the principal’s office explaining why he should get his instrument back and vowing never to bring it again.
 Until tomorrow.
 At twelve Buddy had graduated to electric guitar, a gift from his father, Al Gardner, who had played clarinet with a dance band called Dick Delisi and the Syncopators, at the Vapors Supper Club in his own mis-spent youth.

When he climbed into bed, he fell asleep instantly.
 Not long after, Harruq rose, took his swords, and left for his own meeting.

 “You’re late,” Aurelia said, stepping out from behind a tree.
 Harruq shrugged and held out two branches he had whittled into crude imitations of swords.
 “Had to make something for me to spar you with,” he said.
 “Those sticks are unnecessary,” Aurelia said as she took up her staff, the tiniest hint of a smile curling on her lips.
 “Draw your swords.”
 “Are you sure?” Harruq asked, raising an eyebrow and gesturing to her completely unarmored figure.

The scene from above was just as incomprehensible.
 I focused on one thing at a time.
 Directly below me, I saw Grey.
 He was caught, wrapped in vines as my own body was.
 But there were flames circling his feet.
 I followed his gaze to find his opponent, and then dove.
 I hadn’t put much planning in this, but I was still running on adrenaline.
 I decided the fastest course of action was pecking his eyes out.
 It worked.
 He threw his hands up, covering his face, screaming.

Advances in the technology of organization, as much as advances in the technology of production, have been responsible for global progress during the present century and, especially, during the post-war period.
 We have argued earlier that establishment of effective and lasting peace requires a radical restructuring of the existing institutions for global governance.
 Unless and until the UN comes to embody in its own functioning the principles of representative democracy, it cannot hope to play a leading role in maintaining peace and freedom in the world.
 As government and political leaders know only too well, an organization with responsibility but without authority is doomed to failure.
 Unless UN member states invest international institutions with the necessary authority and meet their financial commitments to support them, the world will continue to drift and flounder, powerless to oppose petty dictators and ruthless aggression.
 Unless a cooperative world military force comes into existence, every country will continue to be burdened with the enormous expense and insecurity characteristic of the old system.
 Perhaps more than any other institution, the military has under stood and demonstrated the enormous power of organization to accomplish a goal.
 The Gulf War was a dramatic illustration of the importance of reliable information, perfect planning, logistical support systems, effective chains of command and swift responsiveness to changing situations.
 If humankind could mobilize and apply the same efficiency to the war on poverty and unemployment that it has exhibited in preparing for and waging military wars against each other, very soon there would be no more poverty or unemployment to fight.
 During the Second World War Ford Motors converted from manufacture of cars for the masses to making trucks and airplanes for the military, producing B-24 bombers at the rate of one per hour from a single production plant.

The men had double swords sheathed on their back, long ears, and long black hair.
 They were wearing some type of combat boots and thick coats.
 One of them moved and I saw a tied dragon staked to the ground.
 It continued to try to stand but it seemed to weak and fell back down.
 I heard Emily gasp in horror and I felt the same way.
 One of the men poked it in the side with the butt of his sword and the dragon grunted in pain.
 I looked over my shoulder at Emily.
 She looked like she was about to start crying any second.
 Seth drew his sword and crouched down.
 He shuffled forward and motioned for us to follow.

“What do you mean, I was speaking English and so was the dragon.” I shook my head.
 “No you weren't, you were making grunting and growling sounds.” “That's odd, I didn't think I was,” she said.
 “I told the dragon that we were four half-lings who needed shelter from the rain.
 Then he asked if we were against Kojas and I said yes, that he was hunting us.
 Then he told me that he would let us use his cave because he was on our side.
 Then I thanked him and here we are, inside the cave nice and dry.” “Maybe that's your power, you can speak to dragons,” Seth suggested.
 “But I don't understand how you two get powers and we don't.” “Be patient,” I said.
 “Yes,” Emily murmured and stifled a yawn.
 “Girls first, Seth.
 Have a problem with that?” “All right then,” he said and leaned against the wall.

Every second felt like an hour.
 I squeezed my eyes in an effort to make it all go away.
 Make it stop, make it stop… Seth gave me a comforting squeeze but it didn’t help.
 I tried to think of something else, like penguins or llamas.
 Anything, I didn’t care what I thought about, it could be underwear, as long as I wasn’t thinking about what was actually happening to me right now.
 Llamas, I thought urgently.
 Llamas are furry and they spit at you when they’re mad.
 They’re the joke of most middle school kids, they’re tall…I think.
 You can see them at parks or zoos.
 They tend to try to steal your dad’s hat at the zoo.

I figured I would need the tools to fix this place up and make it livable.” Rodregas continued, “It is dark and late.
 Let’s make camp in here.
 In the morning we can start seeing about getting this farm in order.” With that they all worked together to get the barn organized and clean.
 There was no more talking, each had plenty of their own thoughts to mull over.
 Rodregas was feeling pretty good at the moment, dangerously positive.
 He had learned long ago that the better you felt, the harder came the emotional fall.
 He knew this was all too good to last, but knowing that it would not last also made it more important that he enjoy the moment.
 Rodregas was free.
 He was being hunted; but hunted because he had finally dealt out justice.
 He had killed two monsters, two who wore faces not their own, and who he could feel no remorse for killing.

 The monsters surged up the hill, blocking out Kojas’ delirious laughter.
 Seth shouted, “Stay together, don’t get separated!” A troll charged at me and I jumped to the side.
 I looked up and saw that Emily, Jason, and Seth had been swallowed by the rushing creatures.
 So much for that plan.
 “Emily!” I yelled but my voice was drowned out.
 I saw a flash of fire off to the side.
 Emily was fine.
 I twisted around so that the troll charged past me.

“There,” he said.
 “He returns.”
 Robed in black, the figure approached unseen by the guards.
 He lifted his hands, which shone a pallid white in the fading moonlight.
 So very slowly their color faded, from white, to gray, to nothing, a darkness surrounding and hiding them.
 “What’s going on?” Harruq asked.
 He pulled one of his swords out from its sheath, pleased by the feeling of confidence it gave him.
 Qurrah said not a word.
 His eyes were far away, and his lips moved but produced no sound.
 “Qurrah?” Harruq asked again.

Once formulated, these conceptual models need to be applied under a variety of conditions to test their validity and demonstrate the value of a comprehensive approach to development.
 Therefore, we have proposed that the UN adopt a number of districts in different regions of the world, including crime-ridden inner cities or impoverished rural areas in industrial countries, to evolve and apply strategies for their rapid transition to a higher level of development.
 Six Goals in Education
 Once formulated, this knowledge needs to be imparted through education.
 Education is the greatest known civilizing force and the single most powerful lever for human development.
 Training imparts skills, but education increases the capacity of the individual at a more basic level, making the mind more active and alert, converting physical energy into mental energy, training us to see things from a wider perspective, to question and challenge the status quo, to think and imagine, to innovate and invent, to make decisions for ourselves and to act on our own initiative.
 Education is the process by which society passes on the accumulated knowledge and experience of countless centuries to new generations in a systematic, concentrated and abridged form, so that today’s young people can start their lives at the high point of knowledge and wisdom attained by preceding generations.
 Education replaces the slow, subconscious process of trial and error learning with a swift, conscious process.
 This accumulated knowledge is a great power that can be utilized to accelerate human development and abridge the time needed for society to arrive at progressively higher levels of material, social and psychological fulfilment.
 Despite the massive efforts of international institutions to create awareness of the vital role of education in peace, democracy, economic development, population control and environmental protection, progress on extending the benefits of education to all humankind is still grossly inadequate.

Instead it had the cast of blue steel, an enchanted steel / Mithril alloy.
 It was as strong as Mithril, but had more weight to it and held a better edge.
 Rodregas backed up, not wanting to see the results of his sword matched against a blue steel sword, as it would likely result in his short sword becoming shorter.
 Rodregas then stepped forward, he had to be careful though, he was a good foot taller than his opponent.
 The guard’s long sword gave him better reach.
 Rodregas swung at him and retreated.
 The two shared several blows.
 The third time that he retreated after taking a blow, the guard went for the kill.
 The guard extended his whole body out in a lunge, thrusting his long sword out to its full length.
 The guard saw Rodregas’ braided leather armor and steel sword and thrust with the point.

We must not fail.”
 Aurelia had heard enough.
 She knew their roles, the balance and position of their hearts.
 It was absurd, poor souls without a home, family, or position to be speaking of power and obligation.
 Her hatred of their unknown master grew.
 He was a puppet-master, and her dear friend was one of his puppets.
 If they still doubted, even for a moment, perhaps she could save them.
 Perhaps there was still time to pull them from the necromancer’s cold fingers.
 Aurelia turned and ran for the forest.

“The dwarf said to meet him tomorrow morning near ‘the thorn that reaches the sky.’ What does that mean anyway?” Jason stepped over and spoke instead of Emily, who was furiously writing everything down, as if she’d forget in a couple of seconds, “It could be a description of something in town, maybe a building or a landmark.” I suddenly got an idea and took another piece of paper out.
 “Hey Jason maybe you could draw what you think it might be and that would help us.” “I’ll try my best, Jazell,” he said.
 I knew that his drawing would probably help us.
 He was the best artist I knew, his artwork was almost real.
 “Hey guys,” Emily piped up from her paper, “I think we should get home and speak to our parents.
 I want to see what this dwarf was talking about when he said that everything was already arranged.” “I agree.” I grabbed my backpack.
 “Wait, are we going to go?” Seth and Jason grinned at me and said together, “You bet.” “That is if we can find the place,” Emily reminded them.
 I turned the door knob and walked into the kitchen.
 My mom and dad were sitting in the living room looking extremely excited.
 Before I even had a chance to say hi, my mom jumped up and rushed over to me.

I fished out my notes and desperately tried to remember how to calculate some of the stuff we'd need to know in order to successfully get our weight up the ramp, over the obstacles, and otherwise to the appropriate destination using the minimum number of pulleys, the shortest ramp, and the thinnest string possible.
 Alec hardly even looked up as Mrs. Alexander came by with our particular spool of thread, an array of metric weights, and a note card bearing the amount of weight we'd been assigned to move around.
 I was still leafing through my binder when Alec started testing the strength of our 'tow line.'
 I scooted my desk over and picked up a weight to hand to him, only to see the thread break as he successfully figured out the breaking point.
 Again and again it happened.
 I ran a calculation for how many pulleys we'd need to lift our weight up the thirty-degree incline on a string able to hold only a fourth as much, only to look over at his paper and see not only had he already arrived at the correct figure, he'd already thought to adjust for starting friction.
 Not used to being outclassed academically, I got flustered, which led to a misplaced decimal, and then an incorrect conversion from English to metric.
 Alec just continued on, never seeming to really hurry, never actually making a mistake, but still grinding through calculations with a speed I might have been able to match on a good day, but couldn't even approach today.
 It would've been much easier to just stop my efforts and watch him work, but I was too stubborn to give up.
 Alec finished up with the theoretical portion of the assignment, and started stringing the pulleys while most of the other groups were still arguing over whether or not they could afford to add a few extra grams for extra credit.

That year, the Yankees won in five games.
 The following week my mom stayed home from her job, teaching eighth-grade English.
 Her headache was so wicked, she grimaced and groaned.
 I tried to coax her to the doctor.
 She said he had already given her pain pills, which was all he could do.
 Then I came home from school and found her lying in a heap beside her bed.
 Breathing in shallow puffs, eyes open and watery.
 Above the right eye was a long gash, already scabbed over.
 I suspected a prowler had clubbed her and swiped her few items of jewelry.
 But she managed a goofy smile and mumbled that she must’ve fallen, and getting up had seemed too hard to bother with.

I have two pictures of Eric.
 His senior picture, given a full page in our senior-year annual, a head shot of keen blue eyes with thick lashes, freckles, and sandy hair, a chin square as Dick Tracy’s, an easy grin that would have wrongly convinced you he was loaded with confidence.
 And the one Sylvia called the “Jesus body picture” a snapshot somebody took in the locker room.
 Eric in a jock strap, beaming, his legs and arms spread as though to greet a familiar angel.
 Eric was superman.
 Strong, handsome, understanding, considerate, creative, vital, and brilliant.
 It was Eric who brought home Bertrand Russell’s Why I Am Not a Christian.
 My preferred reading was stories, but Eric wanted to commune with great thinkers and then talk about them, to explore ideas together, in hopes we might discover the meaning of life.
 As winter approached, we sat by the fireplace and took turns reading out loud.
 We admired Russell’s smug attitude, the gall of a fellow who accused Christ of utter arrogance for counting people vipers simply because they disapproved of his preaching.

He glanced once more to Harruq.
 Three elves lay dead about him.
 He could use them, knew he should use them, but something turned him away.
 It was the look on his brother’s face.
 He could not bear to see it.

 Harruq barreled around the curve, determined to catch the foul elf that had dared injure his brother.
 As he turned the corner, the twang of bowstrings filled the air.

Written from pain, written in dread—so, well, it ain’t exactly art.
 “Melody” is something altogether different.
 An early composition that is still pretty pretty.
 I’ve tried over the years to work it into something passable, something acoustic for a new album, but, well, I’m still trying.
 Its appearance on this Great Black Wonder especially rankles, because it’s a song I want to get right.

Only how would you know what things look like to us?"
 Alec's chuckle held more than a little resignation in its timbre.
 "You are amazing.
 Anyone else waking up in a strange place would've run away as soon as they regained consciousness.
 At the very least, you should have started screaming.
 Instead you wander around, take in some rather feeble attempts at art, and then sneak out without saying a word."
 Secure in the knowledge he could see me, I stuck my tongue out at him.
 "Hey, my survival instincts, or lack thereof aren't the point.

I showed him a family photo and he identified Thomas as the guy.
 When I searched my house I found liquid Hydrocodone prescribed for horses.
 Thomas had been using my house as his daytime drug den.
 When I confronted him, he denied it, and even went so far as to blame Brandon and Bryce.
 He threw his nephews under the bus to cover his ass.
 Another rift between us.
 I had to protect my boys.
 In their teenage years, Brandon and Bryce were as different as perfect strangers and they were becoming young men.
 As they began to become more independent from me and from each other, they became interested in different things.
 I tried to accommodate them as individuals and stay close to them.

He swung for her face, turning the blade at the last moment so the flat side struck her.
 The sword smacked off Aurelia’s cheek as if she were made of stone.
 The clear noise rang throughout the forest.
 “What the abyss was that?” Harruq asked.
 Aurelia laughed.
 “I’ve cast an enchantment that protects me from your blades.”
 Harruq looked at his weapons and then shrugged.
 “Interesting.
 Do I get one too?”
 In answer, Aurelia smacked her staff against Harruq’s shin.

I didn’t roll out of bed for a minute; instead I lay staring at the ceiling trying to prepare my brain for the day ahead.
 I heard my mom and dad walking downstairs, talking excitedly about where they thought I was going to go today.
 I rolled off my bed and walked sleepily over to my dresser to pull out a pair of jeans and a shirt.
 After I had pulled the shirt over my head, I grabbed my half empty traveling bag and headed down stairs.
 I dropped my bag near the door and walked over to the kitchen table.
 My mom had placed a full plate of eggs and toast on the table; I sat down and started to eat.
 My mom hurried over and glanced at her watch.
 “You have about a half an hour until you have to leave.
 Eat up.” I responded with a quick shovel of food.
 Within 25 minutes, I was standing by the door with my stomach all queasy.

"A hamburger?"
 Marie forced her mind back to the present.
 Or the past, depending on one's point of view.
 She and her mother couldn't just pop into the nearest fast food restaurant.
 There was no nearby fast food restaurant.
 "I mean, tea and cucumber sandwiches would be fine."
 At the tearoom her entrance was greeted with cries of disbelief and happiness.
 Everyone was amazed that she looked perfectly healthy and whole, and they were polite and desperately curious when she said she didn't want to talk about what had happened.
 She'd love to know what rumors were going to be flying about, but she knew none would be as fantastic as the truth.
 Several friends invited her to parties and dinners planned for the weekend, but she declined all of them, saying that she wanted to spend some time with her family.

The look of fear, the look of sympathy.
 He’d held me back to save me.
 Tears streamed down my face and my body began to release from the dead weight.
 Chevelle had saved me from my mother’s fate.
 How long had he been my watcher?
 In the memory, he’d fought to keep me from seeing, tried to cover my eyes.
 And later, he’d pulled me from the water, dragged me away as we fled.
 I shook with sobs and a pair of arms wrapped around me, supporting me as my limbs became heavy, my body and mind spent from the stress or whatever trauma the spell had caused.
 I couldn’t say which, because I was pulled from consciousness into a black, dreamless sleep.
 Chevelle was still holding me when I woke in the late morning.

In an effort to try and balance things out the dream angels granted me another vivid dream on Sunday night.
 It was wonderful.
 I got to swim around in the most glorious pond known to man.
 I was somehow faster than normal, and spent what seemed like hours chasing around slivers of light that turned out to be some kind of long, thin fish.
 For perhaps the first time in my entire life I didn't mind at all that I'd ended up in a swimsuit so small I might as well have been wearing nothing at all.
 In fact, the feel of the warm water sliding past my skin was so incredible I almost considered skinny dipping.
 Of course that'd only lasted for about a nanosecond.
 Even in a dream, there were things that were just too scary to really entertain.
 The dream lasted longer than any of the others before it, but even so it eventually lapsed into a normal, boring dream.
 Still, I woke up feeling more refreshed and rested than any other time I could remember.

“Too many have died at your hand.
 What life you have ends tonight.”
 Velixar roared, a sound that made Qurrah shiver and avert his eyes.
 His master’s back was to him, so he could not see the face that Dieredon saw, which was full of rotted skin and crawling, feasting things.
 Suddenly Dieredon pulled back.
 The blades in his bow snapped inward.
 “Arrows cannot hurt me,” Velixar mocked.
 “They did not the first time.
 Why do you hope so now?”
 “Because these arrows are different.”

They undid our handcuffs when they were done, emptied our pockets of every dollar, and even took the pot we had.
 They left us in the field and all we knew to do was to walk back the way we came.
 We hitchhiked to the airport and stood outside where the planes were de-boarding.
 We hustled an unsuspecting tourist into buying our surfboards so we could return to California.
 I collect-called my mother from Waikiki once we knew what flight we would be on and she was surprised to hear my voice since we hadn’t talked in months.
 She picked us up at the airport and I think her head almost turned in a circle when she saw us.
 Our hair was down to the middle of our backs and we were as dark as natives.
 It was crazy times then.

My friend has one too.” “That sounds like the other one.” “What do you mean?” she asked.
 The augothas uncurled its tail and took off in the air.
 “I must go, friend.
 Good luck.” It took off into the sky and Emily couldn't see it anymore.
 She sighed and leaned back.
 This was getting too complicated.
 Who had the augothas meant?
 *** The sky had turned gray and the sun, which was still hiding behind the clouds, seemed to drop.
 I was still walking and walking and walking and walking and walking... You get my point.
 I was so sick of walking I couldn't explain it in words.

Think of it as repayment."
 The words weren't anything special, but there was something about the way he said them that made me absolutely sure he'd deliver on his promise, that he was somehow completely in control of his surroundings.
 The intensity in his stare was too much, and I found myself looking away, trying to buy some time to collect myself.
 Luckily I wasn't so far gone as to not recognize where we were.
 "Oh, gosh, that was the turnoff to my house.
 I'm so sorry."
 Brandon flashed me another smile and quickly maneuvered his car through a U-turn, a feat I was fairly certain was harder than it looked in the bulky muscle car.
 "No harm done.
 You guys bought the old Anderson home then?"
 I nodded, staring out at the desolate landscape.

God I was just kidding.
 Look I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to offend.
 Now can we get on with the name?
 Liz – If you want something big and bad and scary, why don’t you go with a famous name, that no human has ever used, like Polythemus, or Kraken or even Grendal.
 Eugene – Hey, that’s a good idea, I would never have thought of using a name of a mythological monster.
 Thanks Liz.
 Jim – Most of those names aren’t well known, and the people who do know them would die of laughter rather than of fear.
 Liz – Use a modern monster name then, like King Kong or Dracula or something.
 Eugene – Hey great!

This was during college spring break, a sad time to be in that town if you were eighteen, on a peanut butter budget, and didn’t belong to a fraternity.
 The girls were taken.
 The parties were private, the bars off limits to minors.
 We spent our evenings with the fellow who had picked us and invited us to flop with him and his roommates.
 The three of them were carpenters, down from New York and New Jersey for the winter.
 Bobby Casso was one of them.
 He claimed his dad was a Mafioso until he got on some capo’s hit list and fled to parts unknown.
 Bobby was a master storyteller, and one of his stories pierced my soul.
 In summers, Bobby worked as a bartender at the Left Bank, a saloon in Lindenhurst, Long Island.
 One of the regulars was Jack Kerouac.

The city’s fear was deep enough he could sense it like a cold breeze, and he wanted it to deepen.
 An arrow whistled by, clipping his ear.
 Qurrah dropped to his knees as a second thudded into the side of a home, inches from his neck.
 A spell on his lips, he spun, grabbing chunks of dirt in his hands to use as components for a spell.
 From two windows, a pair of elves held bows, and together they pulled back the strings and released their arrows.
 The ground beneath Qurrah cracked and tore as his spell completed, so that he fell into a deep pit.
 The landing jarred his back, and he gasped for air, but for the moment he was safe from the arrows that went flying above.
 The fire continued to spread.
 Qurrah could see its flickers of light, and even in his little pit he felt the heat.
 His whole body ached, and he wished nothing more than to lay there like a corpse in a grave, but he had no time.

I focus on the occupants of car after car.
 I am far too tense to be sleepy, but I am dazed by the constant parade of memories and possibilities that march through my head as I attempt to digest thousands of thoughts—hell bent on answering the question: Why do I sit here?
 It has been many years since I have been involved in a drug deal, and my assumption is that the process hasn’t changed much.
 My mother has been through too much pain and I can’t imagine what affect it would have on her to visit another family member in jail if things go badly tonight.
 I think about the deep secret I have now and what my mother would think, and those defining moments that led me here.
 Chapter 2: Small Town Whispers Sometimes life’s secrets begin with life itself.
 My mother discovered she was pregnant with my older brother Thomas while she was still a high school student in a tiny town in Kansas.
 To this day the town still has brick streets and tiny homes that are a throwback to simpler times.
 The town is so small that the phonebook is about the size of a comic book.
 It was 1957 and she was impregnated by her boyfriend in the back seat of his parents’ car.

I wasn't supposed to say anything.
 I just couldn't let you go after her."
 The immediate crisis past, I could have lost myself looking at his features, but a slow smile suddenly reminded me of the only other person I knew that could pack so much pain in such a simple gesture.
 "What about Rachel, Alec?
 Where is she?"
 I hadn't thought his expression could become anymore bittersweet.
 I was wrong.
 "Rachel doesn't have anyone either, but she's still suffering from a deeper hurt.
 She's with my mother."
 My confusion must have been more than usually self-evident as I sat up.

 On one final occasion, my parents were having a large party at the house.
 I was sitting at a desk in my room doing some schoolwork and I could hear the guests’ loud voices in the hallway beyond my door.
 Suddenly my door burst open and slammed against the wall.
 It was Dino, and he commanded me to stand up.
 I could see some party guests in the hallway behind him.
 The sound of the door and his voice had them looking at me from around his large frame.
 Their conversations stopped as their attention was drawn to the commotion.
 I stood and Dino directed me to approach him.
 He was obviously drunk and I could see the usual crazed look in his eyes.

The evening out with her family was wonderful, but when she awoke the next morning, it was with the same confused mixture of happiness and panic that she'd felt when she'd thought about leaving Rick and coming home.
 Her breathing shallow, she sat up and tried to calm herself.
 She and her mother were going shopping today, and it would be an exciting day.
 She was certain to run into most of her friends while they were in the shops or at lunch, and they'd all make plans to get together.
 Tom was coming over for dinner tonight.
 She'd talk him into taking her to a speakeasy this weekend.
 Everything was back to normal.
 But that thought didn't erase the hollow spot in her heart.
 Today would be the first day in more than five weeks that she wouldn't see Rick.
 As much as she was looking forward to seeing Tom, that wasn't the same as knowing Rick would be home at 5:30, would kiss her and ask how her day had been, would hover around her as she made dinner.

It was all so surprising that it took me a moment to find my voice.
 "Thank you, Donovan.
 Have I slept in too long?"
 A gentle smile met my inquiry.
 "Those of us who don't require normal amounts of sleep have all been up for quite some time, with the exception of Master Alec, who remained abed for an uncharacteristic length of time, but the rest of the house is just now waking.
 In fact I rather suspect you have just enough time to shower and eat before Mistress Rachel will be pounding on the door, as it were, in excitement for your upcoming trip into town."
 A groan escaped me despite my best efforts.
 Donovan was too polite to ask outright, but I had to respond to his raised eyebrow or he might think I didn't want to talk to Rachel.
 "I'm sorry, Donovan, it's just that I really hate shopping."
 "Ah, yes.

Velixar grinned.
 Clever girl.
 The wave of sound and ice slammed his body.
 He flew backward, ice tearing his skin, but no blood came forth from those wounds.
 The larger pieces smashed his body from side to side, which turned limply with each blow.
 When the wave passed, Aurelia leaned on one knee, gasping for air as she stared at the man in black, now a crumpled mess of robes in the center of the street.
 The body suddenly convulsed, the chest heaving in quick, jerky spasms.
 When the sound reached her, Aurelia knew her doom.
 Velixar was laughing.
 He stood, brushed off pieces of ice clinging to his robes, and then glared at her from afar.

Rachel and Britney were both in their accustomed places, Rachel studying away as always, and Britney making some weak efforts to do likewise.
 Two of the other three, a boy and a girl I recognized from second hour, but whose names I couldn't even begin to remember, were already packing their books into a pair of book bags, one of which was a fairly utilitarian item, the other of which probably cost as much as my whole wardrobe.
 I couldn't place the last boy for all that he looked really familiar.
 He had incredibly dark skin and features with a slight Middle Eastern cast.
 When he shifted in his seat, I realized he was built like a football player.
 Not like a lineman, but like a running back, or maybe a quarterback.
 He wasn't as big as Brandon, or even as Alec, but he was obviously well muscled, and he moved with an echo of their grace.
 None of which helped me figure out where I'd seen him before.
 He wasn't a regular at the tutor lab, and didn't have the hectic, desperate look of someone cramming for a test.
 Instead he looked completely at ease sitting in one of the no-man's-land tables with a pair of books open in front of him.

Rodregas saw her standing on the ground.
 It was not that she had floated down.
 It was as if she had she had been in a regular sized tree.
 She smiled and waved at him to follow her.
 Rodregas decided to follow her example.
 If it did not work, between his Celestial essence and now the Night Panther’s sigil, he probably would not die.
 Sure enough he was on the ground like he had dropped a few feet and not a hundred.
 Doi’van looked at them; he seemed amused and with a deep laugh of his own made a big show of jumping off the root he was standing on.
 The few feet of his jump seemed to lack any magical qualities.
 “So, other than making the most memorable snack of my life, you say this was the equivalent of a greater sigil for the Elemental realm.

He knew his friend spoke the truth, but he was not so sure about his ability to do what he needed to keep his relationship with the beautiful AElven Nymph.
 CHAPTER 11 THE NATURE OF BONDS
 The next few days Rodregas and Doi’van recovered quickly under the powerful healing magic of Jordaan.
 This is not to say Rodregas did not spend most of his time dreaming that the handsome young Nymph would head back to his own estates.
 They were staying in a small village that seemed to be mostly a forest with small rooms built into it.
 Rodregas could not figure out any set pattern to the place or its boundaries.
 There might have been a dozen or even hundreds of Nymphs living there.
 Though all the Nymphs were friendly, he was still eager to leave.
 Jordaan was doing one of his mystic checks, running his hand a foot above Rodregas’ reclining body.
 Occasionally, his hand seemed to be moving in the air like a baker making bread.

"Adri, Adriana?
 Excuse me."
 I didn't recognize the girl standing across from me, but based on her uncomfortable expression and the fact that more than one person had turned for the sole purpose of watching us out of the corner of their eyes, she'd been standing there longer than I'd realized.
 Apparently my looking up was enough of a response for her to proceed.
 "I've got a note from Mrs. Campbell.
 She asked me to deliver it to you."
 I managed something that could just barely be construed as a thank you, took the note, and watched her leave.
 A note from a teacher, even one I liked, didn't seem very important when weighed against failing two of my six classes.
 The reoccurring thought of how horrified my Dad would've been that his daughter, 'the smart one,' was going to flunk out of high school was enough to keep me constantly on the edge of a panic attack.
 The longer that went on the less ability, and even more dangerous, the less desire I'd have to try and fight it off.

Karen – Good idea Jim.
 Liz – Especially since I’m on the receiving end of the spray.
 Johnny – May I be excused for a while?
 Art – You feeling okay?
 Johnny – I’m fine, I just have some things to take care of, and I’m not too hungry.
 Art – Go ahead, but don’t take too long, we have traditions to uphold.
 Jim – Dad, that’s not going to induce him to return quickly.
 Karen – Do you want us to leave some dinner out for you for later?
 Johnny – No, I’ll take care of it.

The few vagabonds left in the city quickly learned to avoid the worn building marked by holes in its roof and long shadows that lingered no matter where the sun shone.
 Harruq shoved open the door and then halted as he breathed in the stuffy air.
 “Nothing like home, eh?” he said.
 “Move, before the meat spoils,” Qurrah said.
 The big half-orc stepped out of the way.
 Qurrah came through, carrying a slab of meat in his hands.
 He weaved across the missing planks in the floor and sat next to a small circle of stones.
 Above him was a hole in the ceiling for the smoke to escape.
 “Since when has spoiling meat stopped me from eating it?” Harruq asked.
 Qurrah laughed.

“While guards are usually not allowed in, it is not unusual for close friends or advisors to go in with some of those of the blood; to share their wisdom on the best possible greater sigils to take on.” “I will assume,” said Rodregas, “that they had never heard of a Nymph entering the chamber, much less one of the Hellborn?” “AElves are not uncommon and actually more Orqui than I expected.
 One servant thought that Nymphs used to go in during his father’s, father’s time, but not any time recently.
 No one could even imagine a Hellborn going into the Chamber,” agreed Doi’van.
 “Well as far behind as we are, we might not even get the chance to try to bully our way in,” Rodregas said.
 Doi’van nodded and that comment seemed to end the conversation.
 As Rodregas headed out to the sands of the Cathedral arena for the jousting match, he was relieved to see Imeralda waiting at the entrance to talk to him.
 She had been out all night on her mission.
 “Well, I have to say I am very tired of talking so I will make this quick,” she said with her normal sunny smile.
 Rodregas had to admit she did look tired.
 “First, Geriodon is much disliked.

Emily and Jason listened to every word I said.
 When I got to the part about Kojas, Emily's mouth made a small O and Jason's eyes widened.
 My voice shook as I recalled the dwarf's dead body.
 “That's awful!” Emily said, her voice shaking.
 She hopped over and gave me a small embrace.
 “I'm sorry you had to see that.” “Uh...thanks Emily,” I said and allowed myself to be hugged.
 She bounced back over to Jason's side and waited for me to continue but there was nothing else to say.
 I had told her everything I needed to tell her.
 Did she somehow know that I wasn't telling her the whole story?
 I looked at Seth out of the corner of my eye and saw him doing the same.

All had at least two ribbons; and all swore secrecy at the source of their sigil.
 The biggest surprise was probably Geriodon, who had beaten Rodregas earlier that day.
 Rodregas could not argue against sharing the minor sigil as he clearly fit the description of a worthy candidate.
 Geriodon was more than happy to swear that he had no love for the Guild and that Justice should be dealt to all equally.
 But before accepting the sigil he wanted to be sure that any Shadow Order he joined was mostly about secrecy to protect themselves, and that he would still be able to compete for true knighthood in the Order of the Soaring Heavens.
 Rodregas dropped into his cot tired and exhausted.
 Even with his healing sigil he had needed a full night’s rest, but duty did not wait for what a man needed.
 Imeralda woke him slightly after dawn, and Rodregas could tell that both she and Doi’van had spent the few hours left of the night working on what was left of their equipment.
 The tear in both his leather shirt and chain were sewn up, the first with thread the second with steel wire.
 For a mace, Doi’van had bought a piece of round solid steel from the smithy.

Jasmin's backless black dress and shoulder-length gloves had streaks of blue that brought out her eyes, while Dominic's tight, red gown seemed to give her the confidence and poise you'd expect from someone so gorgeous and utterly exotic.
 Jess had opted for a sleeveless silver number that flared out at the bottom so much I wasn't sure how Isaac would be able to walk next to her without stepping on the shimmery material.
 Rachel's mauve dress was probably the most conservative of all, neither over-snug, nor especially low-cut.
 It had seemed entirely out of character considering what she'd purchased for the rest of us, but when I'd asked, she'd just grimaced and said Alec would've made her stay home if she'd chosen anything more daring.
 None of which helped me feel any more comfortable in the tight, strapless wonder Rachel had been so excited to give me.
 Even with all of the weight I'd lost since the accident, it still felt like the material was fighting a losing battle to stretch itself over my frame.
 I'd been hoping to be able to put off actually putting the dress on for at least another half hour, but when my makeup had finally been pronounced satisfactory, Jasmin had studied me for a few minutes, pulled my hair back, secured it with a pair of silver combs I was worried might actually contain genuine diamonds, and then helped Rachel cram me into the dress.
 If Jessica hadn't grudgingly complimented me on just how good my hair looked, I might have suspected Jasmin was trying to purposefully make me look worse than the other girls.
 Dominic and Rachel had to tell me I looked good, that was an unwritten girl-rule regardless of what species you were.
 Jessica had no such imperative, so I was forced to conclude Jasmin had done the best she could considering what she had to work with, and resigned myself to being the homely one in the group.

What was wrong with him?
 “You are welcome, half-orc,” the elf said before moving on, the bow still hung comfortably on his back.
 Harruq watched him go, staring longer than he felt he should.
 He couldn’t shake the feeling he was being led into a trap.
 “So be it,” he said.
 He would not be afraid of meeting an elf in battle.
 Grumbling, he stormed off for the forest.

Public education is the most powerful policy instrument.
 With public opinion widely divided over the best course of action, it is necessary to win back the understanding, support and endorsement of the population for an alternative programme which the major parties and social groups can back.
 This requires educating the public to understand both the costs and benefits involved in any reform strategy, the trade-offs between immediate advantages and immediate sacrifices required to establish a new and stable equilibrium.
 3.Economic strategy must be balanced: A market economy can be introduced gradually or step-wise, but it cannot be introduced in a fragmentary or piecemeal manner.
 Deregulation of prices was the most prominent feature of the strategy in most countries, because it was the easiest to implement.
 But under conditions of shortages in economies dominated by huge monopolistic enterprises, price deregulation led to skyrocketing prices and spiralling inflation.
 A market flourishes only when several essential conditions are met – freedom of pricing, freedom of entry and exit from industry, free flow of information, unrestricted movement of goods and services, competition between enterprises, control of monopolies, and private ownership of property.
 The entire package of free market practices must be implemented hand in hand, otherwise it does not work.
 Freeing pricing without first regulating or dismantling monopolies, promoting privatization of land and enterprises, ensuring free flow of goods, and establishing wholesale markets and multiple distribution out lets lead to speculation, soaring prices, hoarding and falling production.
 Historically, the free market evolved over centuries in conditions of surplus production and stable currency, neither of which exist in Eastern Europe today.

He must be very weak.
 “Easy there young man,” said the old Nymph.
 The Nymph slowly helped him up and held a bowl to his mouth.
 “My name is Durien and I am healer, please slowly drink this.
 Rinse your mouth out with it as your mouth is probably very dry after all this time.” The drink tasted like tea or maybe a light broth.
 As soon as Rodregas started to drink it, he realized he was starving.
 “I need more,” Rodregas croaked as he finished the bowl.
 The Nymph, an older man who unlike any Nymph Rodregas was familiar with, had his hair pulled back in a pony tail, nodded but said, “Slowly, too much right away is not good for you.” Rodregas nodded and cleared his throat; which was dry and felt like it had pebbles in it.
 While the bed was normal enough, the walls of the room were strange and seemed to be made of woven branches and some sort of hide or dark canvas pulled between tree branches to form an oval shape.
 “Doi’van and Imeralda, do they live?” he got the words out, though it hurt his throat to speak.

The dirt before her rumbled, cracked, and then ascended in a great physical wall.
 On the other side, pieces of bone thumped against it, one after another.
 “Cute,” Velixar said, “but pointless.”
 An invisible blast of pure force shattered the wall.
 Aurelia crossed her arms before her face as chunks of earth slammed into her slender form.
 She rolled with the blows, her mouth casting before she halted.
 Ice spread from house to house, walling Velixar off on the other side.
 “From dirt to ice?” Velixar asked.
 “The end is just the same!”
 The center of the wall exploded inward, but this time Aurelia was prepared.

 Shut up, Frey, shut up!
 They seemed to relax a little as Chevelle shook his head and brought his horse back to pace.
 I thought I knew what they were thinking.
 Idiot.
 Ruby answered, “Hmm,” with a cocked eyebrow as she turned to follow the group.
 They were mostly silent the rest of the day, until we stopped for the night.
 The group split after dinner as Anvil and Grey positioned themselves on rocks at the perimeter of our camp.
 Ruby hung out by Grey and Steed busied himself as Chevelle paced stiffly around the camp.
 I was bored again, with everyone entertaining themselves, so I leaned back against a rock and pulled my pack to my lap.

Your homework was incomplete, and of the problems you bothered to attempt, you didn't do a single one correctly.
 Britney, you're headed towards a failing grade, and while you might not care, your father most certainly does.
 Make my class a priority, or I'll stop in for a checkup and let slip just how poorly you're doing to dear old Dad, and then you'll find yourself riding the bus to school."
 It was a vicious threat, but one almost guaranteed to have an effect.
 Britney most definitely didn't want to be stuck riding the bus with all of the junior high kids and other assorted 'losers'.
 Her mouth opened and closed several times and then she nodded and fled the classroom.
 When I finally caught up with her she'd recovered enough to complain, but there was a breathless nature to her voice that told me she wouldn't be skipping the math lab for a little while.
 I made non-committal noises as we waited in line, all the while scanning the cafeteria for two faces.
 Actually, scanning wasn't the right word for it.
 I just kind of looked that way and instantly found my eyes drawn to Brandon.

“Course I’ll let you rest when you need it.
 Come on, let’s go.”
 They stopped twice for Qurrah to catch his breath.
 His weak body gasped for air, sweat lining his face and neck.
 In the starlight, he looked so pale, so frail, that Harruq wondered how his brother could be so fearsome in combat.
 When they neared the firelight, they stopped to plan.
 “So what should we do?” Harruq asked.
 “They are not asleep,” Qurrah said.
 “Something keeps them awake.
 I fear they know of our arrival.”

I was in Guild Dealer Taigas’ Menagerie to be sold within a week of my arrival.” He finished, his smile fading at the memory.
 “When was that?” Rodregas asked.
 Doi’van looked at him for a second and said, “Two years ago.” “But that makes no sense,” Rodregas said, his voice angry though he did not know why.
 “The Guild is supposed to be trying to make their Immortalists members Celestial.
 Why would they hold you for two years?” Doi’van nodded but then shook his head.
 “Trust me, I would like to know that answer more then you.” Doi’van’s smile was now long gone and with a shrug of his huge misshaped shoulders, he changed the subject.
 “So, Imeralda, the stone here still seems strong and like new, though clearly, it has been long after the construction of this place.” She was looking at Doi’van strangely and it seemed to take her a moment to shift gears and answer his question.
 “Yes…of course construction like this…stone enchanted to absorb the power…it makes the stone stronger with that power.
 Stones formed like this will last as long as the ley line does not move, which happens only rarely and over centuries.
 What is strange is this is not a farm designed by Nymphs.

Envy, fear, friendship, none of them fit.
 Whoever he was, he quietly left the room while my head was still whirling.
 I looked up to find Britney frowning at me.
 "What is your deal?
 I don't think I've ever seen Isaac notice anyone other than his girlfriend.
 He isn't like Alec, who notices everyone but is too good to actually speak to any of us.
 Isaac's just so caught up in whatever is going on inside his head that he doesn't realize any of us exist."
 Britney slammed her book.
 "First Brandon decides he has the hots for you, and then you crack the ivory tower.
 There's absolutely no justice in the world."

It wasn't even because saving me would be too much work.
 He was completely convinced the world would be a better place without me.
 I'd never been so unnerved in my life.
 As Mrs. Alexander took roll and then released us into our groups, I was still trying to pull myself back together.
 It didn't help when I realized we were being evaluated today.
 I fished out my notes and desperately tried to remember how to calculate some of the stuff we'd need to know in order to successfully get our weight up the ramp, over the obstacles, and otherwise to the appropriate destination using the minimum number of pulleys, the shortest ramp, and the thinnest string possible.
 Alec hardly even looked up as Mrs. Alexander came by with our particular spool of thread, an array of metric weights, and a note card bearing the amount of weight we'd been assigned to move around.
 I was still leafing through my binder when Alec started testing the strength of our 'tow line.'
 I scooted my desk over and picked up a weight to hand to him, only to see the thread break as he successfully figured out the breaking point.
 Again and again it happened.

I also wanted to let you know that I'm happy with what you've been doing at the lab, and to give you this."
 As unbelievable as it was considering that most of my classmates seemed more concerned with working their fast-food jobs than with doing homework, the plain envelope she handed me contained my very first paycheck.
 Ever.
 I all but skipped out of the classroom.
 Later I'd probably complain about how small it was and wish I had enough to go shoe shopping, but for now it was just nice to know I had some discretionary money.
 Brandon looked up as I walked into the cafeteria, and waved me over.
 As I threaded between a pair of closely-set tables I noticed that Alec's table seemed unusually unsettled.
 If a shouting match could be conducted in whispers, it was being done by Jasmin and James, neither of who looked like they were happy about whatever was being discussed.
 Alec wasn't talking, but from the way he was scanning the room, he didn't want to be there anymore than the rest of them.
 I made it to Brandon's table, and was still pulling my meal replacement drink out of my bag when the loudspeaker clicked on with the obligatory burst of static.

The first questions had been easy, but it had been a very long time since he had studied law.
 The sorcerer’s body language, though, directed his memory to the answer.
 Rodregas said, “The local lord is responsible for replacing the other lord messenger’s lame horse.
 There is nothing to be done for the Immortalist messenger’s horse.
 It is the responsibility of the local lords to provide mounts for the Guild at the local lord’s expense.” He made sure his voice remained rough with no emotion coloring his response, just a simple squire giving a by-the-book answer.
 The Knight Captain nodded and said, “Welcome to the tournament, Squire.” He then turned to look up at the sorcerer and asked him, “Any other questions Ambassador?” The sorcerer spoke his next question directly to Rodregas, “I noticed you have a Hellborn at your side, you would insult the faith of the Knights by bringing him into the Cathedral of the Heavens?” Rodregas knew this question would come up and had the natural answer, “They are my sworn followers.
 Sworn to the All-Father.” Such an oath could not be challenged here.
 “Truly?” the sorcerer said.
 “The Great Oath of Fealty for one of Infernal birth?
 I would see that.” He turned to Doi’van who loomed over all of them.

There was no mistaking our destination when we spotted it.
 It looked like the recreation yard in the film One Flew Over the Coo Coo’s Nest, as people milled about, stopping and turning to look at us as we entered the parking lot.
 The facility itself might have been a roadside migrant worker motel.
 People were roaming around the grounds doing everything from raking leaves to just hanging in groups, but each one stopped what they were doing to examine us as we drove in.
 We could immediately tell that visitors to this desolate location were rare.
 Brandon approached the vehicle with enthusiasm and the brightest broadest smile we have ever seen on his face.
 We instantly noticed his weight gain and he proudly announced through our open car window that he was nearing 170 pounds, and he looked healthy for the first time in so many years.
 His complexion was clear and his eyes were the bright blue they once were and the whites of his eyes were shinny and clear.
 Brandon could hardly wait for us to open the car door and he embraced each of us as if he hadn’t seen us in years.
 I know I hadn’t seen him like this in years.

He didn’t.
 Instead he crosscut, his left arm swiping right while the other swept left.
 She turned to one side, using her staff to press one sword into the dirt and knock the second swipe just above her.
 The staff continued twirling, positioning Harruq’s hands further out of place.
 She used the awkwardness to gain further separation between them.
 Her hands ached from the force of every block and parry.
 Her breath was fast and shallow.
 Her hair, which she had failed to tie up before the fight, hung in wild strands before her face.
 She was beautiful, but Harruq did not see it.
 To Harruq, she was the young girl cradling her sister.

This interests me, I guess.
 When I told my shrink I didn’t use to be a spiritual person, his answer was, “You were not aware of being a spiritual person.”  I didn’t like his correction and insisted that, no, I embraced atheism briefly, then settled into a kind of solid-artifact agnosticism, i.e., I didn’t believe in anything I couldn’t put in my mouth and suck on.
 This is a line of thinking invented by my friend, Eddie, who named his belief system, Oralism.
 It made perfect sense to me at the time.
 Eddie has since become the father of two beautiful little girls and I don’t know where that leaves him, belief-wise.
 We haven’t talked about it.
 Which is maybe part of what I’m digging at here.
 My therapist reiterated, “Denying you are a spiritual being is like denying you have a left arm.”  I’ve come around more to his way of thinking, though I hate to lose any argument.
 Man, I’m a believer, just like Mickey Dolenz.
 (laughs) So, I believe now that we are spiritual beings.

 "Yes.

 Mrs. Tranton sat down on the bed.
 "You miss him, don't you?"

 She closed her eyes, trying to hold back her tears.
 "So much that it hurts."

A cold wind came blasting in, seemingly from all directions.
 Faster and faster, the words poured from Qurrah’s pale lips.
 Harruq braced himself as his hair fluttered before his eyes.
 The spell neared completion, and Velixar hissed in sheer pleasure at the power flaring from his apprentice.
 Qurrah shrieked out one final word, the signal, the climax of the spell.
 “ _Rise!_ ”
 All around corpses staggered to their feet.
 “Qurrah,” Harruq stammered but could say no more.
 “Eight,” Qurrah gasped, dropping to his knees.
 “It is…‌I am sorry, master.”

In Sub-Saharan Africa, the rise was from 1.9 per cent to 3.9 per cent and it is expected to reach 5.8 per cent in 2005.
 In the former Soviet republics, growth has accelerated from 0.1 per cent to 4.1 per cent and projected to touch 6.6 per cent next year.
 These trends are likely to continue throughout the decade.
 While foreign aid to developing countries as a percentage of GDP has fallen by 50 per cent since 1990, it has been offset to some extent by a 150 per cent rise in foreign investment.
 In the least developed countries, foreign aid has declined by 24 per cent but this has been offset by a 29-fold increase in foreign investment, so that the combination of foreign aid and foreign investment as a percentage of GDP has remained constant.
 If the rich countries, particularly USA, had met the UN development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of GDP, progress in improving the human condition in countries characterized by a high incidence of poverty would have been faster.
 These real and significant gains have been offset and to a large extent obscured in our minds by the persistence and aggravation of problems that constitute the other side of the post-Cold War ledger.
 Far from vanishing, the nuclear danger has been aggravated by the continued proliferation of nuclear weapons, the increasing danger of these weapons falling into the hands of terrorists, and the stubborn refusal of the existing nuclear powers to seize the opportunity to totally eradicate this pernicious arsenal of self-annihilation.
 Reduced confrontation between nation states has been followed by an aggravation of internal conflicts within countries as well as a dramatic increase in threats of violence by disenchanted minorities.
 Violent local conflicts continue to flare around the world.

Like Georgiana, Suzetta, Glaforia.
 They stopped simultaneously.
 “Frey.” Junnie was talking slowly.
 “Stay calm and lie still.” I tried to convey my incredulity as I lay there, unable to move.
 “Explain to me what happened.” All the anger and excitement turned numb.
 What came out sounded no more than a statement of fact.
 “Chevelle held me back and made me watch my mother die.” Junnie didn’t have the outraged look I expected.
 I sifted through the dream—the memory—searching for a way to explain so she would be stunned and infuriated.
 They stared at me, and I was suddenly sure they were the reason I was lying on the ground incapacitated.
 They had control over me.

What was it the mayor had said?
 "I can't promise he'll even read it."
 It was a he who'd intervened on our behalf, and Rachel and Alec's father had died years ago, while Brandon's father...actually I knew next to nothing about Brandon's parents.
 I wasn't even sure whether or not they were around.
 They must be though--if it had been a male who'd saved us, then it couldn't be the Graveses, and that left only Brandon's family.
 It was hard to believe that Brandon had stepped in and done so much for us, but the pieces fit together so tightly.
 Brandon was even more wonderful and amazing than I'd thought before.
 Part of me expected this new revelation to keep my mind whirling so fast that it would take me hours to go to sleep.
 I was only partly right.
 It took quite a while for me to go to sleep, but this time the culprit was the light outside my window.

It had never crossed my mind before, but as I considered it, searching for proof the documents were wrong, I realized Aunt Fannie had never used magic for anything but service.
 It hadn’t seemed unusual to me, it was just the way it had always been.
 And besides, I could barely do anything aside from lighting candles.
 Was this why council was so quick to accuse me of practicing dark magic?
 It was rarely even discussed and never tolerated.
 What had Fannie done?
 I flipped through more of the pages, realizing something was out of place.
 It didn’t make sense official documents about Fannie would be among those relating to the apparent extinction of the northern clans.
 And why had all the documents I’d found about the tragedy been separated, mixed up, and missing pages?
 I tried to sort it out, but found there were other council documents there too.

 Not likely, she thought, her body still tingling.
 Rick propped himself up on an elbow, gazing at her.
 Her eyes were closed, her face still flushed.
 He knew that she wanted him, and he didn't think she'd respond to his touches and kisses the way she always did if she didn't love him.
 He could make her happy if she stayed here with him.
 They'd get married and make love day and night.
 And soon they'd have children.
 She'd have a family here, and that would make up for the family she had in 1927.

Alec's face tightened with something I was willing to bet was anger.
 "No, I didn't cheat.
 I did the research to find the answer, presumably just like you did.
 Next time you feel like insulting me, please suppress the urge."
 I had at least one nasty comeback on the tip of my tongue, but I swallowed it.
 I didn't like his tone, but he did have a right to be mad.
 Luckily, I was saved by Mrs. Alexander's appearance at the door, a dry-erase marker behind one ear, a pencil behind the other.
 The rest of the class period should have been enjoyable.
 My group had the right answer, which I'd come up with on my own, and we were now learning about leverage, mechanical advantage, and friction, all of which were actually pretty interesting.
 I studiously ignored Alec, even though I could all but feel him glaring at me the entire time.

Rodregas swung his shield aggressively, he hit the man’s sword with his shield and then banged the other man’s shield hard.
 Rodregas’ goal was to see if he could out muscle the man while staying protected by the shield.
 It worked!
 Clearly his opponent, though set for a heavy blow, was not expecting the strength of Rodregas’ bash.
 Still his opponent was too good to fall, even when surprised.
 And even as he half fell backwards he used the momentum to slide down and try to land a blow low under the shield.
 Rodregas had both quickness and strength on his side.
 He blocked the blow with his sword and then bashed down quick and hard multiple times with his shield.
 He thought he heard a bone break.
 Rodregas paused and the knight signaled him as victor with a finger to the Heavens.

Olga is a minimalist.
 Though plenty educated (holding a Master of City Planning degree) and able to follow a more lucrative career, she chooses to work cleaning houses.
 She shares an apartment and pays less than $400 for rent and utilities, in a pleasant neighborhood near a commercial district.
 On most of her errands, she can walk.
 When she needs to drive, she uses her 1994 Toyota Tercel.
 She tells me, “It’s not like a sacrifice.
 I just don’t need much.
 A person with a family needs more than I do.
 Usually what somebody needs depends upon their function.
 A corporate CEO, maybe he’s got to throw parties and he needs a bigger house.

"I know that you have to sort things out now that you've decided not to marry your boyfriend.
 But please give me a chance."
 He slid both arms around her, gathering her close as his mouth covered hers.
 His kiss was almost irresistible, but she was hurting too much to stay in his arms.
 Breaking off the kiss, she stood and turned away from him as tears poured down her cheeks.
 "What's wrong, sweetheart?"
 Rick stood, putting his hands on her shoulders.
 Marie shrugged his hands off.
 Wiping her face, she turned to look at him.
 "If I'm in love with you, how will I bear it when I go home?"

Seth’s head blocked out my vision.
 “Hey, you alright?” I sat up and Seth helped me up.
 I rubbed my sore back and looked around, taking in the dead looking trees and shadows.
 “Where are we?” “I don’t know, Jazell.
 The creature must have been a setup to bring us here,” he replied.
 “I think I know who did it.” “It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure that out, Seth,” I pointed out.
 I looked around.
 “Where are the others?” Seth went pale.
 “I don’t know Jazell, they aren’t here.
 They’re just gone.” My stomach twisted into a knot.

Don’t make it all for nothing.”
 Harruq’s anger and frustration simmered and swirled in a dying fire.
 He could not argue with her, not about that.
 Even he could see what she had sacrificed to save his life.
 “Where do we go?” he asked, his voice revealing his defeat.
 “We’ll figure it out in the morning.
 For now, we travel north.
 Your brother will be fine, I promise.”
 He nodded but said nothing.
 The two traveled in between the hills, exhausted but unwilling to stop their movement.

For a while during the after-prom at a bowling alley, I left her and found Margaret.
 We hid under a pool table and talked about Eric and our dubious futures.
 Karen didn't care to join us for yet another party at Black's Beach, a place only accessible by a trail down a high sea cliff, where police never showed to bust rowdy kids for drinking.
 So around dawn, I rode shotgun while Cliff drove and Lucas Field and Carol Stuhr napped in back.
 We were on Murphy Canyon Road, a two-lane without sidewalks or curbs, bordered by vacant, hilly land.
 I dosed off.
 Then Cliff joined the rest of us.
 The parked station wagon we rammed might've saved our lives, as it kept the convertible from running up the side of a bank and flipping onto our heads.
 The station wagon was wrecked, Bob's Ford was totaled, and the four of us got cited on account of the case of beer in the trunk, which was meant for the beach party.
 Maybe in consideration of it being our prom-night, the police dropped charges on the condition that Cliff agreed to pay off the station wagon owner.

Van’dret was a man of some refinement and appreciation for art, and he wished he had dared to stop and inspect the pieces; they had to be some of the greatest art works in the Realm to be so on display where only those who had been invited to a private meeting with Taiga would see them.
 However Van’dret dared to do nothing more than glance at them as he hurried forward.
 It would not be smart to make the Guild Dealer wait for even a moment.
 The Guild Dealer Taiga was not such a common man that he did his work from a desk; his desires and commands came during parties and social events.
 However, if you were truly honored, though personal invitations to dine with him in his personal solar overlooking his city you would get told his wishes.
 As Van’dret stepped through the arch he was struck by the bare simplicity of the solar.
 The city known as the Menagerie of Sky, Earth and Water that Taiga ruled and had created over the centuries was a lush place, full of pleasures and growing things.
 Anything that could be found in the world was said to be found within its gleaming walls and exotic gardens.
 However, the private place where it’s Master worked, was a stark contrast.
 It’s marble columns and arched ceiling spoke of simply sophistication and understated power, and much more accurately reflected the nature of its owner than the over the top shows and pleasures of the Menagerie.

“Steed, why aren’t they together?” He sighed; I didn’t think he enjoyed discussing his sister’s personal life.
 “Ruby.
 She doesn’t believe she can get close to anyone… that way.” I considered the way she was with me, as if she wanted us to be friends, the way she touched Steed, sat near him.
 “Why?” “Past experiences.” Yes, she’d killed her mother.
 And how many others?
 What had she said, until a pattern became noticeable?
 I shivered at the thought.
 “Poison.” He nodded in silent acknowledgement.
 “In the village, some of the elves never paired up.” I thought of Junnie’s family.
 “But I guess most of those had received the calling.” Grey scoffed ahead of us.

 I had thought he had shown up because I’d impressed upon him to follow before I blacked out, but I had already been bound again at that point.
 Should I tell Chevelle?
 I didn’t know why I felt so protective of this secret.
 Chevelle drew a section of moss from one of the stones on the wall and it replaced the pebble.
 “Try this.
 They shouldn’t have bothered binding you from growing.” I concentrated on it.
 Nothing.
 But I was never good at that anyway.
 I shook my head.

"The mongrels unnerve you a bit?"
 The scorn on the face that the comment belonged to was unnerving.
 I'd seen him several times before, but didn't have a name to go with his aristocratic features.
 "That's enough, Vincent."
 A trace of rebelliousness flared up at Brandon's chastisement, but Vincent buried it so quickly I almost didn't have enough time to classify it before it disappeared.
 Interestingly enough, I could see Cassie out of the corner of my eye, and she didn't look any happier than Vincent.
 The rest of lunch flew by.
 I'd never realized how much fun it could be to belong to a group.
 Things weren't ideal; I'd never met a group with so many inside jokes.
 Half the time I felt like there was an entire conversation being carried on over my head, but sitting next to Brandon left me with such a tingly feeling all along my right side that I didn't really mind.

Celestial Beasts are far more.
 You saw that for yourself didn’t you?” she asked softly.
 Rodregas simply nodded.
 It was interesting what she said, but he was not sure why she was bringing it up at this time.
 “Only the Immortalist have ever taken on the essence of a Celestial Beast as they get ready to become gods,” Imeralda continued.
 Her eyes wandering around the arena, waiting.
 Her voice had a casual quality, but Rodregas sensed she thought this very important.
 “When Doi’van sees you, he thinks of you as one of the blood, a noble in fact, if not by birth.
 Most of the men and women in this circle are that; faster, stronger because they descend from a Celestial god.
 But you are not that.

It was the same elf who had fired the first warning shot to Antonil before the entire battle had begun.
 “I am but a poor outcast,” Qurrah said, hiding the handle of the whip underneath the palm of his hand.
 The coiled leather vibrated, hungering for blood.
 “Do not lie to me.
 I have watched you two slaughter my brethren.
 I have seen much of your handiwork.” The elf glared at him, ugly hatred skewing his handsome features.
 “By now your brother is dead.
 Three of my best warriors await him around that corner.
 I thought it appropriate you knew this before I took your life.”
 “Do not talk to me of what is appropriate,” Qurrah said.

Five weeks and two days.
 And they had no idea what had happened to her.
 "I love you, sweetheart."
 She smiled, his words bringing her out of her reverie.
 Yesterday he'd told her he loved her more times than he had the previous four or five days combined.
 And that was saying a lot.
 He hated having to go to work this morning.
 What if, now that he was trying so hard not to think about anything in 1927, his mind wandered to it?
 He knew he wouldn't be able to bear it if he went home and found that she had disappeared.
 After nearly four hours of trying to concentrate on his work, he gave up and told his secretary that he wasn't feeling well and was going home.

Technological developments, such as advances in computers, telecommunications and medical technology, have played at least as great a role in the growth of the service sector as in manufacturing.
 New service jobs in banking, foreign trade, research, design and engineering, computer software, education, health, law, finance, business management, communications, transportation, media and entertainment demand higher levels of education and skills and offer higher pay.
 In 1992 the median manufacturing job in the US paid only $19 per week more than the median job in the service sector.
 The growth of technology is freeing workers from the drudgery of the production line, while providing consumers with a quality of life previously available only to the most wealthy.
 The organization of production is also a major determinant of the number of jobs created.
 The Western pattern of mass production by monolithic corporations that emerged during the first 80 years of this century is no longer the inevitable or even the obvious pattern for either industrial or developing countries in the coming decades.
 Smaller, technology-intensive firms are faster at adapting new technology, more flexible in meeting specialized customer needs and generate more skilled, better-paying jobs.
 Recent experience, such as in the Prato region of Italy, indicates that proper blending of new technologies in existing productive sectors can be utilized to preserve a geographically decentralized, small-scale pattern of production and to enable small firms to match the competitiveness of countries with much lower labour costs.
 This offers an attractive alternative for preserving the small-scale decentralized pattern of production still prevalent in developing countries and for the future development of enterprises in new industries.
 Each advance in attitudes, lifestyles, social institutions and forms of commercial organization has ultimately expanded the scope of economic activities and raised living standards substantially.

You write because you’ve got to man, because it’s your guts that are hurting, your guts that are in need of something.
 And you’re gonna find that thing, even as it keeps receding from view, even as the more you go forward the farther away it gets.
 You ever been to the beach man?
 Seen those little clams, tiny little fuckers, that dive as you dig around them.
 They just keep burrowing downward, and the faster you dig the deeper they go (is that a Beatle’s line?
 something like that) (laughs).
 Anyway, those little fuckers defy your best efforts, they’re almost always gonna be quicker than you.
 That’s what writing is, man, it just keeps going farther into the sand, the thing you’re looking for, the thing that’ll make it all alright.
 It just stays beyond you, just out of your grasp.
 And that’s how it should be, man, because otherwise why would you keep digging?

 An elderly man and woman, propping each other up as they ran side by side, refused to turn when Harruq barreled toward them.
 Salvation took the woman’s life, Condemnation the man’s.
 The two bodies collapsed, their lifeless limbs entangled.
 Not far ahead of them, a woman ran in only her shift, a child clutched to her breast.
 “Why do you flee?” Harruq roared when her crying eyes glanced back at him.
 “This life is pain, suffering!
 I’m here to end it, end it all!”
 The woman ran faster and her child cried louder.

Compare the density of different types and levels of skill in countries at the next higher stage of development and evolve programmes to raise the quantity and quality of skills to that level.
 4.Improve marketing: The organization of marketing is typically one of the weakest links and, therefore, one of the greatest barriers to economic growth and job growth.
 Brazil set up a distribution system for the export of citrus fruits that has enabled it to become the world's largest exporter of this commodity.
 Improve distribution and marketing systems, especially for agricultural produce, by identifying missing links and establishing successful model programmes that bridge the gap between rural producers and urban or overseas markets.
 5.Expand services: Actively encourage and support growth of the service sector through programmes similar to those utilized to support the expansion of small industry.
 6.Develop exports: The new GATT treaty ensures that, contrary to earlier projections, export-led growth is far from over.
 After agriculture, the textile and clothing industry is one of the largest employment sectors in developing countries.
 The industry's global exports are $250 billion a year, of which Asian countries command 40 per cent.
 Trade in clothing is expected to rise by 60 per cent and textiles by 34 per cent over the next ten years.
 As labour costs have risen in East Asia, greater opportunities are emerging for lower-wage developing countries to take a larger share in growing international markets.

 Liz –They’re still fighting.
 Jim take those off, you look like an idiot.
 Jim – I thought that they had started getting along better over the last couple of months.
 Liz – They were.
 Then as usual it all fell apart.
 In short dad took his secretary on the trip instead of taking mother.
 Art – So we invited her for thanksgiving.
 The woman is nearly family, I guess, in a weird contorted sort of way.
 The more the merrier.

He never would have guessed it.
 Well, except for the time she'd tried on the jeans.
 She had shapely legs-- "Rick?"
 She was growing redder as he continued to gape at her.

 "Does it fit?
 Is this how it's supposed to look?"
 "Oh.
 Yeah.

The emergence of the USA as the sole superpower has brought with it a reduction in the role and influence of the UN in international affairs, precisely at a time when the world should be striving to build a viable multilateral cooperative security system.
 The Unfinished Agenda
 The Commission’s report was never intended to predict what would happen in the years to come, but rather to project what could be made to happen by a concerted, determined effort of the world community.
 The report highlighted many of the opportunities that did emerge as well as some of the dangers that have grown in intensity in the absence of effective action.
 The events of the past 15 years may not have followed the course predicted by either the optimists or the pessimists, but they certainly confirm that this has been a period of unprecedented opportunity for rapid progress – what Sri Aurobindo termed an “Hour of God”.
 While the gains have been significant, all of us will acknowledge that we have not taken full advantage of this opportunity to build a better world.
 Though great dangers have receded, old and new threats still loom large, demanding courageous action.
 The door remains ajar.
 The hour is still in progress.
 There is still time and that time is now.

Now our games were on Friday nights.
 Since Kenny’s mom didn’t care to deliver us for night games, and since we weren’t yet eighteen, she helped us secure border-crossing passes, which we liberally abused.
 Tijuana was wild and ugly.
 We saw fevered children out in the cold, begging on street-corners after midnight.
 I tripped over a dead fellow.
 In the bars, we saw girls get used by both men and farm animals.
 A few times we rode in taxis to motels where prostitutes greeted us.
 We would barter, object to the price, and leave while the coarser of them screeched obscenities.
 Some cabbies, after three or four such stops, stoically delivered us back downtown.
 Others pulled up beside a gang of thugs.

Instead of following up, Rodregas used the momentum of his kick to swing his body sideways.
 Skilled, close up fighting was all about leverage.
 Instead of resisting the attacker’s strength Rodregas pushed down on the earth with his hands and lifted his body up and to the side, curling the leg he had kicked out underneath.
 He planted his foot under his body.
 His attackers seemed confused, grabbing him and trying to counter his change of position.
 Rodregas only had one leg under him, but he pushed off with it with all his strength and thrust himself up.
 It should have failed with all the men holding him down, but he now had celestial strength, and even with the knife wound he was strong.
 His attackers backed off, confused by the fact that he had gone from being their prisoner to suddenly rising.
 The person pinning Rodregas’ left arm got too far away.
 This gave Rodregas the leverage he needed to pull the arm free.

Of course no focused magic came near him, and what did occur startled even Rodregas.
 Imeralda was literally flying through the air and she had her dagger drawn.
 She did not land smoothly, colliding into Van’dret’s lower body, but she instantly straightened and thrust her dagger into Van’dret’s stomach.
 The dagger did not sink far; a few inches.
 Rodregas expected Van’dret to get his hands up and fend her off, but he seemed to be in shock.
 Imeralda pulled the dagger out and then viscously stuck it back in the sorcerer, her body moved with the stroke, clearly using every ounce of strength she had.
 Still the blade only stuck in a few inches, but Van’dret screamed and fell to the floor and started to drag himself away.
 As soon as the surprisingly high pitch of Van’dret scream sounded, both Doi’van’s and Rodregas’ feet were free.
 Rodregas stumbled for a moment, but was running almost, even as he caught himself.
 Imeralda was stepping forward with the dagger to finish Van’dret, but he caught her arm and said, “Wait.

It seemed silly to even entertain the idea.
 People my age don't really do sympathy very well.
 We're much more inclined towards ridicule and hasty, usually unfair, judgments.
 Still, something had changed.
 I held onto that hope right up until I saw Mrs. Sorenson joining everyone else in staring at me whenever I looked down at my book.
 There was no mistaking the look on her face; it was utter distaste, possibly with a dash of disdain.
 I was so tired of it all.
 By the time English rolled around my natural embarrassment had given way to actual anger at Britney for starting it all.
 She tried to catch me at our lockers in between classes, but I pretended not to hear her, and made it safely into Mr. Whethers' class before she could catch up.
 Part of me acknowledged how petty it was, but I avoided her attempts at a whispered conversation during class.

To say it was the least I could do considering this was all my fault, but the unabashed bliss of having him touch me was overwhelming.
 It took surprising effort to string coherent thoughts together.
 Before I managed to do so successfully, he sighed and helped me to my feet.
 "We'd better get back or you'll miss Spanish."
 Based on how badly Biology had gone, I was dreading Spanish with even more fervor than normal.
 I felt incredibly better when it was Dominic who was waiting with a smile for us at my locker.
 Alec let go of my hand with an actual look of regret.
 Mrs. Tiggs seemed to have read whatever memo Mrs. Sorenson had been working off of earlier.
 She started out the hour by asking me a question I was positive wasn't in any of the chapters I'd ever read.
 The class' collective mouth dropped in astonishment as Dominic called her on it.

He fired arrows three at a time, his quiver never approaching empty.
 He ordered Sonowin lower, shouting out the command as another barrage of bone pelted four more elves to their deaths.
 Skimming above the darkness, Dieredon fired volley after volley behind him.
 When they were past the undead, he pulled Sonowin high into the air to observe the battlefield.
 The ranks of the undead were half of what they had been, yet still he could not see the lowered black hood he so badly needed to see.
 “Come, Sonowin, we will find him, even if it means killing every last one of his puppets.”
 The horse neighed and dove, spurred on by the sight of its own kind falling in death.

Flashes of movement off to either side of us, lower to the ground, made me sure the girls were all following along on four legs.
 Alec shifted me around as he realized I was awake.
 "We've still got nearly half an hour, you should get some more sleep if you can."
 I tried to argue but couldn't find the strength.
 A while later the flash of light as James and Isaac lit flares pulled me back awake.
 It took several seconds for my eyes to adjust, and then I started being able to pick out individual shapes in the darkness.
 Alec set me down as Vincent appeared, a towering, furred figure illuminated by the light of the flares that'd been planted on either side of the cleared space.
 His dark eyes drank in the light as he surveyed us with his typical boundless arrogance.
 A horde of shifting figures milled about just outside of the twin circles of light.
 The rest of Brandon's pack and they seemed to have grown in number since the dance.

He dried his hands on a blisteringly white towel, and nodded.
 "Of course.
 I believe they are in the north end of the valley.
 Right this way."
 We made good time, even with Donovan's jerky, oftentimes painful gait, but the estate was even bigger than I'd realized.
 We walked for several minutes before rounding a corner and finding the entrance to a hedge maze.
 "We're very nearly there.
 The maze serves as a final barrier against unwelcome eyes."
 I was lost within seconds, before we'd made more than four or five turns.
 "No wonder Alec laughed when I threatened to try and follow him.

She shifted uncomfortably from one foot to another, eyes glancing to each side of us in an effort to see who might overhear us.
 "We can't talk about it here; you'll have to trust me.
 Wait until lunch."
 I wasn't entirely satisfied, but nodded, and followed her to algebra.
 Mrs. Campbell shot us both a glance that didn't bode well for any attempt to get out of class without a stern reprimand, but allowed us to go to our respective seats without comment.
 I pulled out the two assignments I'd done the night before, and passed them up with everyone else's homework.
 Realizing the lecture wouldn't do me any good, I pulled out my book, and started reading the next section in my self-appointed study regimen.
 Mrs. Campbell either understood what I was trying to accomplish, or was saving up all her venom for after class.
 She didn't call on me even once.
 Britney wasn't so lucky, and I caught a nasty look from her each time I surfaced from my textbook.

“I will show you, my disciple, but first I have a gift for my dearest bone general.”
 Velixar drew out his magical chest.
 He set it beside him and let it grow out to normal size.
 From within he pulled out a suit of armor stained a deep shade of black.
 He threw it to Harruq, who managed to catch it even though his mouth hung wide open.
 “The first Horde War was caused by a disciple of mine,” the man in black explained.
 “He blessed the armor of one of the leaders of the orcish clans.
 I claimed it when he fell on the battlefield.”
 Harruq examined the suit, turning it over in his hands.
 It was composed of many interwoven straps of thick leather.

What would happen if I failed to surface?
 It'd been easier to lapse into catatonia this time than last.
 Would I reach a point where I couldn't come back?
 There'd been a time right after the accident where Mom had thought I was already there.
 I was just numb enough still to think about such things without immediately collapsing.
 Even so, I felt a pang of dizziness as my mind warned me I'd pushed it too far today.
 I found myself in the kitchen, nearly finished making enchiladas with only vague ideas of why I'd started pulling ingredients out of the fridge.
 I wasn't hungry.
 I knew I should eat something, but that hardly merited putting together anything more complicated than a sandwich.
 What was I trying to accomplish?

 Her eyes had misted over.
 She was about as bright as the girls in blonde jokes.
 But she was a darling, generous and kind.
 So when she invited us to a Billy Graham crusade, to keep from disappointing her, and maybe for deeper reasons, I said “Why not?” Neither Cliff nor I admitted we might want to attend.
 We decided we could read a newspaper account and tell Helga we had gone and found plenty to think about.
 But by the evening of the crusade, something like conscience bit us.

He tried to raise the blade, but all the strength had left his hands.
 He had lost too much blood.
 When Harruq came charging forward, Condemnation red and hungry, all he could do was dodge.
 Condemnation shattered what remained of the table.
 The elf rolled, his arms tucked against his chest.
 When he pulled out of the roll, he dashed for a large dresser.
 Inside was a stash of healing potions.
 All he needed was one and he could fight again.
 Just one.
 As he reached to open a drawer he felt his leg jerk back, halting his momentum.

This was an unexpected instruction and a situation I hadn’t realistically contemplated.
 I was all wired up and the officer flattened his hand out and tapped on my truck’s windowsill to illustrate how low they wanted me.
 “You get here in the crossfire.” He bent me down behind my drivers’ side door.
 “You stay here.
 No moving around.” He told me that in the case of a weapon, they would come in from both sides of the truck with their guns drawn.
 The shooting officers would be on the driver’s side firing over my head.
 (How comforting).
 What had I gotten myself into?
 I didn’t want brains splattered all over my truck, especially if they were mine!
 I was then shown pictures so I could verify Ashley and recognize Steve.

I wobbled, and Chevelle was suddenly there, steadying me.
 I shook off his look of concern.
 “I’m fine.
 Really.” He shifted closer and I became wholly aware of his hands at my waist.
 The grip he’d used to steady me became softer and yet, at the same time, his fingers tightened around me.
 My breath hitched as he pulled me against him, the length of our bodies touching.
 My throat went dry, black spots swirling in my vision.
 I fought to stay focused on his face, so close.
 His eyes grew troubled and then he blurred out of vision as I went limp in his arms.
 “Frey…” I opened my eyes to the darkening sky.

 "Is that what you wanted to happen between us tonight?"
 "No!
 Of course not!

 She stared at him in shock.
 "I don't think that.
 What I'm trying to tell you is that kissing like that is where it begins."
 She frowned, too puzzled and curious to be embarrassed by the conversation.

“You’re going to be beating my ass in a few weeks if you keep learning as fast as you are.”
 “Don’t worry,” she said, patting his hand.
 “Your ass is safe with me.”
 Harruq laughed at the absurdity.
 Aurelia, meanwhile, absently drew lines in the dirt.
 He watched for a moment, suddenly nervous and quiet.
 The words of his brother echoed in his head.
 “Aurry?” he asked.

 The elf looked at him.

Anything that could be found in the world was said to be found within its gleaming walls and exotic gardens.
 However, the private place where it’s Master worked, was a stark contrast.
 It’s marble columns and arched ceiling spoke of simply sophistication and understated power, and much more accurately reflected the nature of its owner than the over the top shows and pleasures of the Menagerie.
 Two small intricate waterfalls softly trickled down each side wall to the, providing a soft soothing sound.
 The back of the room was an archway leading to the terrace, overhead the incredible crystal ceiling let in the natural daylight of the late afternoon sun and would illuminate the top of the tower under its own power during the night.
 In the middle of the room was an enameled silver table set for two, with Taiga lounging in his throne like chair on the opposite side of Van’dret.
 Van’dret hurried forward and fell to his knees with his head lowered; he did not say a word until after Taiga spoke.
 “Please, my friend, there is no need for subservience here; let us enjoy a meal together.
 If you don’t mind, I have a few thoughts I would like to share with you over the food.” “Of course, my lord,” said Van’dret as he stood up he dared to focus on the Guild Dealer for the first time.
 Taiga wore the form of a High Elf male that was slim and graceful, as was most of its kind.

Before we'd even made it out of the parking lot, Britney was once again chattering about everyone else in the school and what they were or weren't doing lately.
 Considering that I still couldn't put a face with most of the names she was tossing around, the gossip wasn't just uninteresting, it was a near ordeal.
 It wasn't until I looked over at the speedometer that I realized we really had been driving longer than normal rather than the gossip just making it seem to take forever.
 Britney caught me registering the fact she was driving under the speed limit for the first time I could remember, and broke off recounting Amy Stevens' supposed fling with one of the football players just long enough to blush.
 "I figured I should be more careful of how fast I drive.
 You know, my dad keeps threatening to take away my car if I get any more tickets.
 With everything else going on right now he just might do it."
 It was actually pretty plausible.
 I probably would've believed it if not for Rachel's description of the new rumor floating around school.
 Britney was trying to cater to my supposed fear of being in a speeding car.

But with beasts like that, you are either in charge or you are game.
 I think that he probably did the right thing.
 No way to know for sure, but they did not rip him apart, so we will say he was very brave and not very stupid.” Then he added, “Of course, if you had asked me before hand, I would have said that taking food from a Dire Cat was a very stupid idea.” He finished with a smile full of sharp teeth almost a match for the lions and in a casual movement lowered his horned head in what Rodregas thought might be his equivalent of a shrug.
 The next morning they repeated the Morning Prayer and meditation ritual.
 This time while Doi’van joined in, Imeralda mostly watched.
 Afterwards Rodregas said to both, “I have been thinking that we are probably going to be here a few weeks while I finish healing up from the knife wound.
 I want to make the most of the time.” Doi’van said, “I have a feeling that you have some sort of training in mind.” Rodregas nodded and said, “I have developed some bad habits the last few years; I know my technique is rusty and now my timing is all off with my new body.
 I am not sure what your training backgrounds are, though.” He said, waving at Imeralda, who often of late was holding her Black Yew bow close with an intimacy that spoke more of a caress than holding a weapon, “Clearly, Imeralda likes the bow.” Rodregas continued, “Even though Imeralda plans to stay out of the middle of things, learning some basic hand-to-hand and sword fighting is a good idea.
 Doi’van and I can spar with each other, which will help us get used to fighting against the sigil warriors of The Immortal Guard.
 So, I think we should practice every morning until noon, then work to try to get the farm cleaned up during the rest of the day.

My knees started shaking as I entered the room, but I made it safely to my normal table before they gave out.
 "Adri, Adriana?
 Excuse me."
 I didn't recognize the girl standing across from me, but based on her uncomfortable expression and the fact that more than one person had turned for the sole purpose of watching us out of the corner of their eyes, she'd been standing there longer than I'd realized.
 Apparently my looking up was enough of a response for her to proceed.
 "I've got a note from Mrs. Campbell.
 She asked me to deliver it to you."
 I managed something that could just barely be construed as a thank you, took the note, and watched her leave.
 A note from a teacher, even one I liked, didn't seem very important when weighed against failing two of my six classes.
 The reoccurring thought of how horrified my Dad would've been that his daughter, 'the smart one,' was going to flunk out of high school was enough to keep me constantly on the edge of a panic attack.

Before we really all felt the power.
 The War was just this endless one-note playing over and over and driving us insane—me insane, sorry, driving me insane.
 And, like, I know that a song is just a song—yet, I have to believe there is something there, an element, a catalytically charged element.
 I didn’t want religion—who listens to priests, clergymen, even those who take to the streets?
 Ali has more power.
 Ali reaches more people.
 But a song, you know, a good song, well, it does tunnel deep into the consciousness.
 Did I think I could do anything with the right words, well-placed, well-played?
 No.
 No, I knew better.

I know a lot of religious people and most of them are fairly accepting of other people’s beliefs.
 They usually don’t try to scare people into line.
 Well anyways go ahead and pray, I doubt that it will do much good, but whatever, have fun with praying for my soul and so forth.
 Oh, while you’re at it, pray for my dog’s soul, I don’t think he believes in Jesus either.
 Ned – I will pray for you, and I will have my church pray for you as well.
 You are truly lost, but God hasn’t given up yet.
 Now I see why I was compelled to come to this sinful affair.
 Have faith, obviously He has not forgotten you, and is even now trying to reach out.
 It is true the lord works in mysterious ways.

Chapter Eleven An Education
 The next morning, Ruby was in the main room waiting for me.
 She instructed me to bathe and change; we would be spending the day training.
 I followed her directives, but couldn’t decide whether to be grateful or worried when the clothes she’d laid out for me were plainly meant for a hard day.
 It was still early as we stole out the back, cloaks covering our heads as we made our way to the ridge.
 Steed, Chevelle, Grey, and Anvil were already there.
 I imagined the others—Rhys, Rider, and their dogs—were somewhere near, though I couldn’t see them.
 Watchdogs, I thought, all four.
 It was comforting, but Ruby wasted no time in getting to training.
 She immediately trounced me.

“I can’t hear you.” Emily snapped.
 “I WAS OUT SCOUTING!” he shouted, “Now can you hear me?” “Yes, and now you’ve made me deaf!” Emily yelled back.
 “Why were you out scouting in the first place?” I asked calmly, trying not to shout it out like Emily.
 Seth gripped the handlebars and I knew he was losing his temper.
 “I was being cautious so we didn’t have to worry last night,” He said through gritted teeth.
 He was lying and both of us knew that.
 I glared at him, “Nice story Seth, now what really happened?” He didn’t say anything and he rode ahead to get beside Jason, who was in the lead.
 The park slowly came in view.
 It was a huge grass circle with a small play set in the middle covered in kids.
 The woods surrounded it except for the side that faced the street.

Eugene – And I was wandering around looking for a bathroom.
 I found one.
 Jim – You walked in on her?
 Eugene – How was I supposed to know that she showered in the nude?

 Liz – When did this all happen.

I was not aware that any of the Knights of the Order were implicated.” Taiga smiled and waved a hand in a dismissing motion.
 “Oh, don’t misjudge my words.
 I did not mean to imply any misdeeds of our valiant Knights of the Soaring Heavens.
 I am not aware of any of them doing much of anything, much less kill an Immortalist.” “Than what should I keep my eye out for?” asked Van’dret.
 He was becoming even more curious to the direction of the conversation.
 “You, my fine Van’dret, are more in the world than most of us.
 You are out traveling and adventuring, while most of us Immortalist just sit in our towers.
 I have always thought that our one weakness was our isolation.
 It is hard to know what is exactly happening when we are not out to see it.”  For a moment, Taiga paused, looking up at the crystal roof overhead in apparent contemplation of the possible implications of their isolated natures.
 After a moment, in which Van’dret waited patiently, Taiga continued, “You are one of our best, and yet you are also in the world.

It was too much to process so quickly.
 When Alec took a careful step towards me, all I could think of was that I'd just seen those same eyes hovering above bloodstained fangs.
 I shrank back away from him, and saw his face go from calm to expressionless in a barely detectable flicker.
 I'd opened my mouth, maybe to apologize, or possibly to scream for help, but it snapped shut at Alec's response.
 Moving faster than I would have believed possible, he spun around and fled through the door.
 Between one heartbeat and the next he disappeared into the darkness, letting the door slam shut with enough force that the glass in the ceiling should have come down in a rain of razor-edged shards.
 The flowers closest to me swayed slightly from the force of the vibrations, pulling my gaze towards them.
 I felt my heart skip a couple of times and tears start to flood my eyes as I took in beautiful white petals edged in an amazing shade of purple.
 Lagrimas del Angel.
 The whole greenhouse was filled with them, and suddenly I couldn't ignore the significance of the circular signature on the paintings anymore.

Got us some studio time.
 He’d been to numerous practices, knew our stuff.
 And he agreed to produce, under the name Euphonious Moniker.
 Of course, now, everyone knows he did it, but back then, I don’t know, there were legal complications or something.
 Anyway, with Jim there, well, he gave us the confidence to do it.
 So we started laying down tracks.
 Now, the story that’s told is that I hated recording, that I was, I don’t know, juvenile, about doing numerous takes.
 I probably did say, “That was good enough,” a couple times.
 But, man, Jim is such a gentle man, he just took it all in stride.
 He knew when it was done, man, when it was complete.

We were kidding ourselves; we felt so powerless.
 He was gaunt, broken out, nervous and angry, telling random stories that always involved the biggest-fastest-shortest-longest-cue-the-orchestra-everybody fucking him over.
 He’d always have to go save someone in some dramatic fashion.
 The things that would come out of his mouth were completely unbelievable lies and his ignorance was evident to all.
 As a parent, I was humiliated when Brandon spoke.
 We encouraged him to seek help, but as an adult Brandon had to want help and he had to consent to help.
 The thought of Brandon being addicted to drugs, overdosing, getting arrested was all too torturous to contemplate, but we did it anyway.
 How could we not?
 He was our son.
 I was so angry at Brandon at one point that I stood with a hammer over the Chevelle and considered destroying it.

Farther down the valley, only a few minutes’ ride away was Raven Town.
 Even the kindest of folk would admit the town was not much more than an inn, a stable, the homes of the people that supported the local farming community, and of course, Raven Keep.
 Many of the keep employees and their family members lived in Raven Town.
 Luckily for Rodregas, there was a turn off almost immediately that let him circle around the edge of town and then start heading out of the valley.
 He went north toward the town of Cruet.
 As dusk was falling there was little traffic.
 Luckily this part of the road was well cleared and open and the horses were fresh so he made headway even as it became dark.
 He pushed hard until he reached the fork that headed west up into the hills.
 It was seldom traveled by anyone except fur trappers.
 Rodregas pushed on through the night and into the sunrise of the next day until even the horse that had been Korin’s ride, which he had tied to the back of the wagon, seemed to be tired and ready for rest.

After traveling the world and witnessing racial tensions rising all around, Billy Graham had grown ever more certain that the only solution was at the foot of the cross.
 He said the foot of the cross was the only place where in every sense all of us are equals.
 We’re all sinners, he said, and we’re sinners by choice.
 We choose to break God's moral laws.
 We become drunkards or fornicators, selfish, consumed with pride and prejudice and intolerance.
 But the sinful heart can’t find happiness.
 And God, he assured us, wants his creatures to get happy, which is why Christ said we must be born again, so he could give us new moral natures, new affections, new objectives, and new directions.
 What planted the hook in me was: according to Billy Graham, when you make your decision for Christ, you do it for the sake of the nation and the world.
 Without God, any nation will perish.
 And a nation is only as strong as its people.

 And that he wanted those aliens arrested and sent back to Mars because they were in the country illegally?

 Or is it preferable never to have been born in the first place?

With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, technology and economic activity in support of fighting forces became an increasingly significant factor.
 As a result, more and more effort was directed at eliminating or crippling the enemy’s economic and industrial capacity and the ‘national will’ to wage war.
 Targeting of civilian populations became increasingly common.
 In the two world wars in this century, opposing sides waged all-out war against the military, political, economic and social resources and capacities of the enemy society.
 The strategic bombings of the Second World War, the fire-bombing of Tokyo, and the nuclear devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki took this concept to the extreme.
 As a result, the ratio of military to civilian casualties in military conflicts changed dramatically.
 In the First World War, there were 20 military casualties for each civilian death.
 In the Second World War, the ratio was one to one.
 In the Korean War, civilian deaths out numbered military losses five to one.
 In the Vietnam War, this ratio rose to 20 to one.

Using magic to pull Chevelle’s horse by the tail, I ran after him, hoping to leap on.
 A tree branch came from nowhere and smacked me flat across the face.
 Chevelle’s horse whinnied as they rode away.
 “Why always the face?” I yelled at his back.
 I winced as a second branch, this one young and green and more like a lash, struck me from behind.
 A fierce growl escaped me and I took off, running at full speed in the direction my horse had gone.
 By midday, I was completely spent.
 I had eventually caught my horse, but the training hadn’t let up.
 I was too exhausted for any anger to remain, but I had the sneaking suspicion Chevelle was enjoying my “lessons.” We stopped by a patch of snow that had gathered in a rock basin, warming it to water for the horses.
 Chevelle jumped down from his horse as I melted off the side of mine and onto a rock, my limbs like molasses.

 Once the police get involved, the school board has to expel.

 Otherwise, they won’t usually expel, for fear a parent will sue them.

 If I can do anything for them, I will.

We nearly died because it was the right thing to do to rescue the Nymphs, especially with the children being part of the caravan.” Rodregas added in a growl, “There were probably Dire steeds as well.” “By the Infernal Daemons, I might be as strong as a Celestial Lion, but we are going to get chopped to little pieces until we have decent armor and weapons.” “But why would they keep the armor?” growled Doi’van.
 “These people do not seem to be warriors.
 What good would it do them?” Doi’van tossed his wild black mane of hair and his eyes lighted with rage.
 Rodregas suddenly realized that he better not feed the Hellborn’s rage.
 Those with Infernal blood were known for their berserker rages.
 They seldom survived the rampages, but were nearly unstoppable when they fell into one.
 Rodregas breathed deeply, trying to lower his own anger and frustration.
 Jordaan stepped outside the room Rodregas had been staying in and into the small clearing that was the center of the Nymph Dwello, the tent like structure that they used for houses.
 “Gentleman, please,” said Jordaan.
 “You must have understood that this village took a great risk in taking you, and those you rescued, in.

Without Rodregas’ conscious will, his own magic raised from the core of his being.
 The two magic forces seemed to mix and then enter the frog.
 They seemed to pour from the frog back into his own body.
 That power felt like a thousand small knives digging into his flesh.
 His body tightened and he could feel Jordaan’s hands hold him firm.
 Rodregas struggled to keep his arm from spasming in pain.
 He knew that Jordaan could not really keep his arm from moving.
 He kept thinking that the ordeal would be over soon.
 When it continued he started to worry about his ability to keep from jerking away from the small figurine.
 Just when he was sure that he could not keep his arm still the pain smoothed and stopped.

You'll even have cell phone coverage, so you can check in with me as often as you want."
 At least I hoped we'd be able to arrange that somehow.
 "As for the brochure, you've got scads of great shots already.
 Maybe if you call up Mr. Peters you'll be able to work something out."
 Actually I was positive Mr. Peters would be amiable to the idea.
 At least he would be if Alec had remembered to work whatever magic he'd used on the Mayor the first time.
 Of course it was possible he'd forgotten to make the arrangements, but somehow I doubted it.
 Mom looked like she was starting to waver.
 "It does seem like a great opportunity, but there just isn't any good way to know for sure it's legitimate."
 That didn't sound like Alec at all.

By the time I finally finished up the rest of my studying, decided I was ready for my catch-up test in Mrs. Campbell's class tomorrow, and spent a few minutes with Rachel, I was well and truly exhausted.
 I thought about going back to the Lilac Room, but it would've just been because I was worried about what everyone else was thinking.
 I'd been raised to believe good little girls didn't spend the night with boys.
 Not even boys who were so gentlemanly it was sometimes painful.
 I still believed that, but my desire to be with Alec had devoured the parts of my brain that used logic and reason to decide things.
 I wanted to be with him while he slept, even if it was only for a couple of hours.
 Everyone in the pack already knew I'd spent the night.
 In the end, the reasonable part of me never had a chance.
 Waking up next to Alec fully vindicated my decision.
 He'd greeted me with his typical, heart-stopping smile and I'd leaned in to kiss him before I'd even realized I was in motion.

He was normally so even-tempered that even his moderate rebuke instantly shut them up.
 I probably shouldn't have felt quite so happy about it, but I was pretty sure from the way they'd been looking at me that I'd been the source of their gossip.
 When the bell finally released us, I couldn't avoid Britney any longer.
 "Adri...ana, why didn't you tell me?"
 I didn't answer for several seconds, not sure I'd actually heard her right.
 "Tell you what?"
 "Fine, play coy.
 I just think you should know it's pretty lame for me to find all that stuff out second hand.
 We're best friends; you should totally have trusted me enough to tell me."
 Apparently I'd only thought the anger was under control.

“Did you sense it?” Qurrah asked.
 “Sense what?”
 The smaller half-orc shook his head.
 “If you must ask then you did not, at least not directly, though I did hear you startle awake.
 Perhaps a fleeting glimpse of it…”
 “Qurrah,” Harruq said, crossing his arms and frowning at him.
 “What is this about?
 Tell me.”
 “Remember the necromancer we witnessed at the siege?” Qurrah asked.
 “It is him.

Hundreds of skulls bathed in purple fire sailed over the walls of Veldaren like dark comets.
 Gaping mouths shrieked mindless wails, their voices bone-chilling and unrelenting.
 A few soldiers fired arrows, but most hid behind their shields.
 “Why do you cower?” Qurrah asked, striking his brother on the shoulder.
 “The skulls are nuisances, nothing more.”
 “Sorry,” Harruq muttered.
 He shivered as a skull sailed just above them, its screech turning to chaotic laughter.
 The sound raced up and down his spine, triggering fear no matter how irrational.
 Qurrah watched as if immune to the sound.
 He was so much smaller than Harruq, his slender body wrapped in rags, thin flesh clinging to bone.

He felt guilty for trying to get her to stay, but he was sure she loved him as much as he loved her.
 She wouldn't be so upset if she didn't.
 Laying her on her bed, he smoothed her hair.
 She had been here for over four weeks, and she'd had no indication that there was a way back to 1927.
 She could be here for the rest of her life, but he knew that until she accepted that, until she decided that she wanted to stay here, she'd never be totally his.
 And he wanted her to be his, heart, body, mind, and soul.
 CHAPTER ELEVEN
 "I like the white one.
 It really shows off your tan."
 Rick watched as Marie turned in front of the mirror, inspecting the white sundress.

Gene cut his hair and actually wore nice clothing.
 I think I would have noticed that Jimbo, are you trying to pull one on me?
 Jim  - This all actually happened, and you were out of it, you forgot to pay the bills for three months, and if you recall you wouldn’t take the time to eat unless either Gene, Liz or I brought you something and nagged till you finished it.
 Art – Ah yes, food the fuel for life.
 It doesn’t seem all that important to eat when your world is falling apart.
 How long did it take for Gene to finally snap?
 Jim  - He started spending a lot of time hanging out at their church doing bible lessons.
 He actually applied himself to it, and was pretty good at debating the bible and other religious topics in just a couple of months.
 Gene turned Conservative Christian, it was kind of scary for several months.
 After about three or four months of taking bible lessons they decided to baptize him.

Would you fill me in on what happened during your ‘baptism’?
 I know you gave a speech, but Jim never got into that.
 Eugene – All I said is what I felt, that God doesn’t exist.
 And then I called them all suckers.
 Art – Jim did say they almost lynched you.
 I can see why.
 Eugene – Well that just stunned them.
 The mob didn’t form until after I dropped my pants and mooned them.
 Art – I understand their annoyance, boy sometimes you don’t have much sense.
 You’re going to have to learn to control those impulses of yours.

That and whether or not I'd seriously injured myself on the way down.
 She looked concerned, but not desperate yet.
 Her cell phone was in her hand, but not yet flipped open.
 It probably hadn't been more than eight or nine minutes.
 "Adri, what just happened?"
 She knew already, the psychiatrist had some fancy name for it complete with a whole list of symptoms and psychobabble garbage.
 It all boiled down to the idea that the more Mom could get me to talk about it, the sooner I'd shake off the fainting spells.
 Yeah right.
 Talking didn't make anything better; it just let him rack up a bunch of fees while I was passed out on his couch.
 "I'm fine, Mom.

Congratulations!” She hugged me.
 “Um,” I choked out in surprise as I was squeezed, “I wanted it to be…uh…a surprise.” I managed to get the words out and seem intelligent.
 My mom released me from her clamp-like hug, “Well I am surprised, and very proud!” “Thank you?” I said slowly.
 This must have been the dwarf’s plan.
 Would have been nice if he had warned me, I thought bitterly.
 My dad got up and glowed happily behind my mom.
 “We are very proud, Jazell.
 You’re supposed to leave tomorrow, so you better pack.” “I’m going to go do that.” I said quickly, while I backed up towards the stairs.
 As soon as I reached them, I shot up so fast you would think I was running for my life.
 I closed the door, locking it behind me and then dialed Emily’s cell phone as fast as I could.

Less than six feet separated them.
 “I have been watching you,” the man in black said.
 “I have dipped inside your dreams.
 You have seen me before, haven’t you?”
 “You were the necromancer that led the orcs against Veldaren.
 You helped them cross the bone ditch.”
 “Correct,” Velixar said, his smile visible beneath his hood.
 “It was a glorious day.
 Men of the east no longer trust the elves, and the elves hold little love for our beloved King.
 Of course, thousands died, but what is a little sacrifice compared to such gains?”

"Rachel said you needed some shoes."
 While I was still struggling to get thoughts to coalesce into words, Alec smoothly went down onto one knee, and picked up my left foot.
 The work of art he slipped onto my foot was so beautiful I felt bad letting it touch the ground.
 I held it up for a second, admiring the way the lights played off its gentle curves while I convinced myself nobody was going to throw me into jail for defiling it by using it for its intended function.
 Glass, or possibly something else perfectly transparent.
 It was hard to tell for sure what it was from so far away, but it wasn't plastic.
 The cool ovals where the sole had been cut away to reveal the material underneath told me that much.
 Whatever it was, it'd been created in layers.
 The outermost material was achingly clear, while the inner layers seemed increasingly less so.
 Alec waited, another smile playing about his lips, while I came to terms with the shoes.
