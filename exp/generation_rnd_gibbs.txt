He did that in front of Qurrah.”
 Harruq thrust out his chin and squinted.
 “This was how that Perry guy looked.
 Seen dogs look more human.
 He was strong, and I think he was the strongest before I showed up.
 I told him about this contest me and Qurrah made up, some arm wrestling thing.
 Guy was drunk out of his mind, so when I told him we could win four gold coins he should have figured something was off.
 “We met after work, just past sundown, and I led him straight to Qurrah, who cast a spell on Perry then, kind of like you did with the guards.
 He shouted until his head turned purple but made no sound for the effort.
 Then Qurrah cast another spell that made him go all tough and rigid.

The smaller half-orc shook his head.
 “Of course not.
 I must keep learning, increasing my strength.
 We will resume, just this time amid the darkness.”
 Harruq nodded, obviously uneasy.
 “Hey brother?”
 “Yes Harruq?”
 “Are you sure what we’re doing isn’t wrong?” He twiddled his fingers, suddenly embarrassed.
 “I mean…‌ they’re children.”
 Qurrah sighed.

Those who lack the opportunity or the ability to labour intensely for their own upliftment express their productive energies through the intensity of violence.
 The international community cannot afford to be silent spectators of the growing violence.
 Peace, democracy and development are inseparable and interdependent.
 Liberal democracy and economic opportunity for all are essential ingredients for winning the war against terrorism.
 Accepting the spiritual principle which tells us that there is an element of truth even in the most outrageous or misinformed viewpoint, we must not only vehemently condemn but also sincerely recognize the unaddressed issues that underpin the urge for violence.
 In this sense, terrorists crudely expose the mental insincerity prevalent in international politics.
 Those who wield national power must come to realize that force of compulsion will not bring about a permanent reconciliation and amelioration of relationships in human affairs.
 Superior power must bring with it a superior sense of fairness and a commitment to constructive dialogue and action to attack the root causes of terrorism.
 It must shed its own accretion of mental insincerity cloaked as diplomacy.
 Then and then only these movements of violence will shrink and finally disappear.

The entrails went into an urn beside the fire and I wondered what she used them for before remembering all the containers on her bedroom shelf with a shudder.
 She stretched the pelt to dry while the meat cooked.
 She poured us wine and handed me half of her plunder.
 “It’s not much, but game close to the village is sparse.
 Over-hunted.
 When we get to the peak, we can trade.
 It is the strangest thing; they herd the animals to town and then corral them to eat at their leisure.” She shook her head at the absurdity.
 “But you haven’t eaten until you’ve tasted a fattened beast.” “The peak?” Concerned, she asked, “You don’t know where we’re going?” I drew a breath, uncertain how to answer.
 I would have been sure not to trust her, but she was traveling with us.
 It was probably best not to tell her, of all people, that I had no clue where I was or where I was going.

Rodregas smelled what he would find well before he came around the corner.
 Next to the entrance was the corpse of a large bear which had recently been killed and partly eaten.
 It had been a magnificent creature, the largest of the local black bears that he had ever seen.
 Rodregas realized that it had been a Dire beast, drawn here by the safe magical energies.
 Next to the dead bear were the two Dire Cats.
 Rodregas had gone around the corner thinking they were in the cellar, but instead found himself no more than twenty feet from them.
 He froze; the two cats seemed to be expecting him.
 They both watched him with steady eyes.
 One reached out with a huge paw and dragged the dead bear’s body closer.
 Did it think he was here to steal it?

Forest creatures sneezed.

 I giggled.
 Evelyn shot a glower at me.
 And then she whirled, storming away, and as she glanced back, her parting expression was so priceless I wished I could see it again.
 “Achoo!” “Choo!” “Hachoo!” My ears popped as I burst out with laughter.
 Evelyn began to run toward town and I couldn’t stifle it, despite the fact that it was absurd something as insignificant as a sneeze would give me such pleasure.
 I wondered briefly how I’d delight in a choking fit and then tugged the lobe of my ear as it popped again.
 Apparently I wasn’t used to laughing.

No one would normally park this far from the grocery store, which anchors an array of businesses, at least not this late at night in this sparsely populated lot.
 I know this place well, as this is where my wife and I buy our groceries.
 It is in an upper class neighborhood serving the wealthy residents who live in their posh homes nearby.
 The front of my truck faces a short decorative fence, which borders a greenbelt area, and I stare across the wetlands that the railing protects.
 As I sit, I think about the circumstances in my life that brought me to this spot.
 I am alert to my surroundings but distracted by my thoughts.
 The fingers on my left hand slowly stroke my bottom lip and then downward across my graying goatee.
 It is eerily quiet but my mind pounds with the noise in my head.
 My attention should be entirely on the task at hand and not the events in my life that lead me here, but my mind hiccoughs.
 I am here because this is where the drug dealers will meet me.

“Aye, I guess we do.”
 He told her of Velixar and his plans.
 He told her of the strength, weapons, and armor granted to him.
 Hesitantly, he recounted killing Ahrqur and the people of Cornrows, a fresh wave of shame filling him as he thought of both.
 “What part did Ahrqur play in this?” Aurelia asked.
 “Was he enlisted by Velixar?”
 Harruq shook his head.
 “Me and Qurrah killed him, then Velixar brought him back and sent him off to the king.

Guess what.

 Life couldn't get any better.
 I was going to Les Misérables with Rachel, and I only had two more hours before Brandon would be taking me home.
 Chapter 16 My time with Brandon blurred by too quickly.
 It was like the time between when he picked me up and dropped me off didn't even exist.
 One moment I'd be blah and mundane, then next I'd be with him and the world was perfect.
 When I was by myself, it was hard to believe it all hadn't been a dream.
 Thursday morning flew by, it was like I blinked and it was already time for Mrs. Campbell's class.
 A number of the other girls, and even a couple of the guys, stopped by my desk before the bell rang to congratulate me on winning the last ticket to Les Misérables.

 Therefore you finished it all last night, and have nothing that could possibly be more important than talking to me."
 Her logic sucked, but that didn't bother me even half as bad as how sure of herself she was.
 I held up my math book with a look that I hoped conveyed how ridiculous she was being.
 "Oh, that's perfect.
 I don't understand any of this junk, so you can explain it to me now and then we won't have to spend as much time in that stupid tutoring lab."
 The old me would have told Britney she was a self-centered wench, but the new me, the one that was all too aware of how much it would suck to go through the next two years of school without a single friend, just forced my face into something approximating a smile and tried to explain why drawing something at random from a bag with replacement was different than drawing something from a bag without replacement.
 It was a fairly straightforward concept that we'd seen twice now.
 I was pretty sure Britney was capable of understanding, she just didn't care, which was the one thing virtually guaranteed to make me mad.
 Stupidity was bad enough; laziness would be a hundred times worse.

My efforts to focus were entirely wasted.
 It took everything I had just to hold myself together until class ended.
 I'd planned on remaining in my seat until everyone else left, but Mrs. Tiggs motioned me to her desk while half the class was still filing out the door.
 "It gives me no pleasure to tell you this, but based on your initial test score I think you should prepare yourself for the fact that you're probably going to fail this class.
 I worried this would be the result of your starting so late in the semester and not having any prior Spanish experience.
 Unfortunately, it's now too late for you to switch into another class.
 I'm afraid you'll just have to take the failing grade."
 I stood there woodenly for several seconds, unsure whether or not she was through.
 She finally made a shooing motion and turned back to grading papers.
 Predictably, there were still a half-dozen other kids in the classroom.

 "Um, Gone With the Wind.

 I felt my eyes go wide.
 "That's a pretty detailed analysis of a book you've never read."
 Rachel blushed a little.
 "I really haven't read it.

We spent the next several hours there in the meadow, sculpting my craft.
 The exercises grew increasingly more difficult, but it seemed Chevelle was only toying with me.
 He must have had experience with fire magic; the flames he produced behaved like an obedient dog.
 Mine, on the other hand, were about as compliant as a wet cat.
 Exhausted by the day’s work, I began to sway a bit.
 Chevelle led me to the base of an old willow tree and I slumped against the trunk, sliding down to lie on my back.
 Chevelle reclined against the tree, his legs coming to rest just above my head in the soft grass.
 I gazed through the immense mass of leaves and branches overhead and breathed deeply.
 I felt the need to explain the welt, and my eyes rose toward him as I lightly touched my cheek.
 “I was searching for my mother’s things…” He didn’t respond, staring straight out into the meadow, so I returned to watching the canopy of leaves.

My hands were bandaged, as was my elbow and right calf.
 My dirty, ripped jeans and shirt had been replaced with clean clothes that were only a little too small.
 That last fact should have alarmed me more than it did.
 Somehow being stripped down by a stranger paled in comparison to a near-death hallucination involving wolves and a monster straight out of a science fiction movie.
 The bedroom was possibly the nicest room I'd ever been in.
 A movie star or millionaire would have had a hard time topping this place for sheer decadence.
 The walls were paneled in some kind of rare, doubtless expensive imported hardwood.
 The bookcases that covered the majority of the wall space seemed to be made out of the same kind of wood, and were filled with more books than I'd seen in the local bookstore the one time I'd convinced Britney to stop by on our way home after school.
 They were all hardbound, with leather bindings and engraved covers.
 There was a stereo system off in one corner, hooked up to a laptop and some kind of portable music player.

 “If something like that is on the entrance, I want to know where this goes.” “I agree but aren't we supposed to be trying to find Emily and Jason?” “I have an idea,” I said and pulled my bow off my back.
 I removed one of my arrows and put my bow on the ground.
 I walked over to Seth and pulled his sword out of its sheath.
 He grabbed for it but I already had it in my hands.
 I put the tip against the arrow and carved the same sign as the one on the wall.

Something about that last thought didn’t seem right, like it wasn’t mine, but I couldn’t follow it.
 The tracker screamed; it had reached his thigh.
 My eyes flicked open.
 The body of the snake made a lump under the skin of the tracker’s leg.
 His face was contorted in agony, but that wasn’t what had done it.
 It was the fear.
 He had cracked.
 Chevelle released the tracker’s hand long enough for the man to scribble a few words of a spell, not allowing him to speak or cast magic.
 He slumped after his surrender, confident the worst was over.
 I reached the sword tip back to his leg and made another incision to release the snake.

“Run, run, run!” Jeremiah shouted to a mother pulling along a young boy.
 “Run west, and don’t look back!” A horrible shriek of pain tore his attention past them to a circle of torches, held by the gathered defenders of the small village.
 He kissed his sword as he approached, horrified by the massacre he saw in the dim light.
 A great half-orc bore down on a strong child of thirteen that Jeremiah knew well.
 Strength in fields and spirit meant little compared to the might of a warrior conducting the dark god’s power.
 Condemnation tore through his rusted sickle, cut his arm from his body, and then hooked around, severing his ankles.
 The boy fell, dying in four pieces.
 Jeremiah knew then he would enter the golden eternity before the dawn.
 Someone swung a torch while another man thrust his short sword.

 And then I realized she had called someone a hunk of horsemeat and I had to stifle a giggle.
 Chevelle nodded, but made no remark on the inquirer.
 Ruby winked at him on her way out and the gesture lit a burn in my chest.
 I turned back to my room and climbed into bed, angry at myself more than anything else, and determined not to let him see.
 I covered my head with a corner of the blanket, suffocating my fractured thoughts with the absence of light.
 I was unsure how long I’d slept.
 The house was quiet when I slipped from bed, trying not to make a sound.

Still, I occasionally enjoyed trying to recreate something I'd seen.
 This time I didn't try to guide my hand, I just let it create lines and curves at random, until something tugged at my subconscious, and a half-formed memory began to materialize on the page before me.
 I knew that the wavy vertical line off the side was destined to become a waterfall.
 The scene was starting to take shape, but for the first time in ages I still couldn't place it.
 A mossy boulder filled itself in with feathery detail, and then I realized the center of the piece was still blank.
 It was like my subconscious hadn't ever seen that part of the landscape.
 Only that didn't make sense.
 How could I not have seen part of whatever it was I was looking at?
 Unless it'd been blocked by something.
 But if so I would have drawn whatever it was that'd been in the foreground.

It was entirely different when it might cost her the biggest break she'd ever had.

 We both sat there in silence for a few seconds as everything sank in, and then Mom exploded into motion.
 She ran downstairs to repack her photography equipment, all the while yelling upstairs to verify that I'd packed all of the other essentials she was going to need.
 Almost before I'd even finished assimilating how quickly Alec had pulled everything together, Mom was backing down the lane as I waved goodbye.
 Alec appeared within thirty seconds of Mom's departure, Isaac close behind him.

 Rodregas did not understand fully what Jordaan meant but he suddenly added, “Then, if Imeralda is bonded to me, she will always try to keep her connection with me?” He asked a question, but he thought he already knew the answer.
 Jordaan nodded.
 “She will love others, but she is bonded to you for all time, until one of you dies.” Rodregas sat quietly, stunned by the news.
 No more words passed between the two until Jordaan was about to leave.

 Right then, right at that very moment, I knew something was terribly wrong.
 They all stopped in front of us, all those pairs of angry eyes staring at us.

 They exchanged some sort of signal, including grunts and yips, and slowly advanced on us.

A complete list of proven but untapped technologies and commercial opportunities should be compiled for each country, each region and local area.
 Programmes should be initiated to publicize information about commercialization of agriculture, stimulating industrialization, encouraging self-employment and new business start-ups, improving management practices, etc.
 Role of the media
 Free and well-developed media are vital to democratization and development.
 For this very reason, the dissemination of information by the media carries with it a great responsibility that cannot be effectively shouldered where private profit is the sole motive, or government control limits freedom of expression.
 The media can play an invaluable role in disseminating relevant information to the public, but the type and quality of information being carried in most developing countries must be radically improved.
 The worldwide tendency to focus on the immediate and dramatic at the expense of that which could make a substantial and lasting contribution to development requires greater efforts to creatively present socially useful information in an easily accessible and interesting form.
 Information in developing countries
 In the industrial democracies there are usually multiple sources of independent information available to the public on most issues.
 The same is not the case in developing countries, where very often the sole source of information is government – which lacks credibility because the quality of information is poor or it is politically motivated – or academic institutions that are insulated from practical, especially commercial, realities.

A Small Farmer's Agri-Business Consortium, a specialized agency for implementation of the strategy, has been established by the government to coordinate implementation.
 In order to evolve a detailed methodology for implementation and to demonstrate the feasibility of the strategy model, district programmes are being organized in 12 districts around the country.
 A detailed study of Pune District in the State of Maharashtra has documented the potential for creating 750,000 jobs through this strategy.
 Extrapolation of these results suggests that the 100 million jobs that India needs to create and the 1 billion needed in the developing world are, indeed, achievable, provided that industrial countries adopt trade policies on agricultural products designed to enhance export opportunities for developing nations.
 International Agenda for Food Security
 The crucial importance of food security to world peace and economic development demands that the international community take collective responsibility and initiative to eradicate hunger and famine on a global basis as a complement to the initiatives of individual countries to deal with the problem domestically.
 The growth of food production in developing countries can be accelerated dramatically by the application of resource-based, location-specific strategies that incorporate a proper blending of traditional and frontier technologies and integrate all the links in the chain of production, processing, transport and distribution.
 Conditions vary too widely from country to country for detailed recommendations to be broadly applied.
 However, a number of strategies are relevant to the majority of developing countries.
 Some of the components of an Action Plan designed to achieve this goal are given below.

That move was similar to one of the moves Doi’van had taught him with the quarterstaff.
 A normal lancer did not have the strength to use the heavy lance in such a way.
 His blow landed high and Rodregas drove his lance into the man’s shoulder.
 Shattered pieces of wood filled the air.
 His opponent flew out of the saddle, an ungainly sight, and landed hard on the arena floor.
 He did not get back up.
 After a few minutes the official signaled Rodregas’ victory.
 Rodregas headed back to Doi’van who said, “I don’t think that technique is what the knights had in mind.” His voice showed his personal pleasure, knowing that a move he had taught Rodregas lead to his victory.
 Rodregas nodded and said, “Decided that my advantage of strength was being matched by armor and steed, so it was time to use agility.
 I was not sure it would work.” “It will be harder the next time.

 "Why didn't you come tell me?"
 She just shrugged again.
 "I-I'll go sit on the patio and wait for you."
 "That's OK.
 I'm obviously not going to get there today."
 He walked silently at her side.
 When they were back inside, she didn't go upstairs to change.
 Instead, she went to the living room and sat in a corner of the sofa, erecting an invisible wall between them.
 Bewildered and a little hurt, he sat down on the opposite end and turned on the TV.

 CHAPTER THIRTEEN
 Tears were streaming down Marie's cheeks when the fog began to lift.
 She was in her own garden.
 She ran to her house, tearing open the door and dashing upstairs.
 She paused at her room long enough to toss her bag onto her bed and then dashed to her parents' room.
 "Mother!
 Father!"
 She banged on the door.
 The door opened, and her father stared at her in shock.

In post-war Japan, South Korea, and more recently Thailand, rising agricultural productivity and a shift to commercial crops have been dynamic engines for economic growth, job creation, higher incomes and rural purchasing power, wider markets for produce, and the growth of downstream industries.
 In Taiwan, this was the result of a conscious strategy to utilize agriculture to stimulate job creation and domestic demand.
 The vast technological gap between the levels of agricultural productivity achieved by most developing countries and the highest yields achieved globally represents an enormous untapped potential for stimulating economic growth and job creation.
 The reduction in agricultural subsidies to farmers in industrial nations called for in the recently signed GATT trade agreements will generate far higher international demand for agricultural exports from developing countries.
 In the next chapter, we argue strongly for an agriculture-led job creation strategy and cite evidence to show how it can generate sufficient jobs to eradicate poverty in many countries.
 New deal for the self-employed
 Excluding agriculture, there are 104 million self-employed and unpaid family workers in developing countries, representing 37 per cent of the non-agricultural workforce.
 Self-employed persons and the small firms which they establish have enormous potential for rapidly generating large numbers of new jobs and raising productivity to increase incomes, provided the right policy measures are in place to support them.
 Japan’s economic growth has relied heavily on the proliferation of small rural enterprises.
 Today, 74 per cent of the Japanese workforce is employed by small and medium-sized firms.

Before he could draw them out the elf spoke, his voice soft and sad.
 “Too much death this day,” he said.
 “For hundreds of years my brother and I lived here, and for hundreds of years more we would have remained.
 He is dead now, and for what reason?”
 “Death has no reason,” Qurrah said, his whole body tensing.
 “No,” the elf said, turning around so he could stare at Qurrah eye to eye.
 “But murderers do.”
 Neither moved.
 Neither spoke.
 Qurrah felt his nerves fray, and in his gut a sudden confusion swelled.

It was incredibly small.
 It was probably on its second generation of students, but looked pretty good still.
 The linoleum floor was faded, but still relatively clean, and the white paint on the walls was conspicuously free of tags and gang signs.
 The students even seemed to be mingling fairly easily with each other.
 I actually kind of missed the feel of armed camps.
 My school hadn't been bad compared to some stories I'd heard from California, but there'd still been some kids beaten pretty severely for crossing the wrong group of wannabe gang members.
 Britney had a piece of pizza, and looked like she was eyeing a piece of cake until she noticed I was trailing along behind her without a tray of my own.
 She actually sighed as she passed the cake.
 The urge to giggle was so strong I uncapped my water bottle and turned slightly to the side in an attempt to disguise my amusement.
 It was one of those moments I'd try to reconstruct in my head again and again.

“I don't know how I knew where to stab them.
 I just did, alright?
 It was weird.” Seth shook his head and leaned against a tree.
 “How come you get some random power when the rest of us don't?” He gave me a fake pout.
 “It's not fair.” I leaned against the tree next to him and rammed my elbow into his side.
 He winced and I grinned.
 “I didn't ask for the power, Seth.
 But it did save our butts so I'm happy, I magically gained it.” “Well I hope I get some cool power too,” Emily said and stretched.
 “Whatever,” Jason said and twirled a knife in his hand.
 He seemed to go back to say-a-few-words-and-then-say-nothing-which-drives-everyone-crazy.

I asked her if I could go meet Billy and Cliff.
 Knowing which way they would walk to the office from their auto shop class, around behind the football field, I took that route.
 The teacher was engaged with a carburetor and didn’t notice me trespassing in his class.
 I found Billy and Cliff wearing goggles, huddled over the head to a Chevy, grinding the valves.
 They had decided Mrs. Bole and whatever trouble they were in could wait.
 They had one more valve to grind.
 Then we stepped out into the sunlight.
 While I gave them the news, Cliff kicked gravel with both feet.
 Billy stared at the sky.
 His chin trembled.

BG:  	Yeah, sure.
 That’s what it was.
 I found myself with existential nausea, the kind you wake up with in the morning and it’s all over you like an animal and there’s nowhere to go because the beast is you.
 I often backed myself into a corner and curled there like a fetus, as if covering my balls and stomach were protection, as if I feared some attack of a physical nature.
 This is what the fear does to you.
 It’s totally debilitating, man.
 Nausea can unseat you, can defeat the strongest man.
 And it’s a nausea that is in your blood—your whole body is sick.
 And, you know, looking at it now, I think I was sick like the country was sick.
 I was nauseated for the USA, you dig?

Marie wanted to throw something.
 Or hit something.
 She settled for snatching up her pillow and slamming it against the bedpost.
 She was confused enough already--she didn't need him making everything worse.
 She loved her family and missed them.
 But she also loved Rick.

I leaned onto an elbow to examine the glistening patches of light on the skin of my outstretched hand, twisting it from day to night, pale to dark.
 Weary and trancelike, I lowered my head, tucking my arm back as a pillow, and fell into a deep sleep.
 Chapter Seven Steed
 The early morning sun streaked through every break in the makeshift door, lighting the entirety of the hollow.
 I considered covering my head with that damp dress and sleeping the rest of the day, but my stomach ached for food and Chevelle might not be far behind.
 I crawled out, rubbing and squinting my eyes, and was able to locate a few roots and greens.
 It would have to be enough to tide me over until I could figure out a way to hunt.
 After knocking the brush away from my shelter, I slung the pack over my shoulder and trudged north once more.
 There was an abundance of streams running through the hills, and a few patches of fat, amethyst berries along the way, so I couldn’t complain.
 And the route was undemanding; the ground was smooth, nothing too overgrown to make passage difficult, none of those nasty snarls that could form from a maze of thorn trees or the network of vines that could tangle your legs.

“Can I read it?” She winked at me.
 I started to share her grin, but before I could, Chevelle was in front of us, his horse blocking my way.
 I was almost thrown from my saddle when we stopped to avoid running into him.
 He was angry again.
 “Frey.” “What?” “Do you remember the last time you used a spell?” I recalled the smell of burning flesh as the maps cut into my palms.
 “Yes,” I muttered, defeated.
 The look he gave Ruby was clear.
 There would be no magic study for me.
 But I did know she had it.
 Maybe I’ll be able to steal it… Lost in thought, I began to fall behind the group.

 He hung Rick's coat in the closet.
 "I might like this girl after all.

 "Not here yet."

 "Hi--what's for dinner?"
 "Steak, baked potato, and salad--chocolate cake for dessert.

I had to think of something but my mind could only concentrate on the snap of her whip.
 Her boots splashed in the melted snow again, and I sent the icy water racing up under the material of her skirt to her bare legs.
 Shock crossed her face and I hoped it would buy the time I needed.
 What now?
 The cold water had thrown her for no more than a fraction of a second, but it was enough time to right myself and execute one quick attack.
 I volleyed a nearby rock, which struck her in the back of the head and threw her balance off for another instant.
 I knew I was larger than her so I gritted my teeth and lunged, grabbing her as I tried to figure my next move.
 She raised her face and, when her eyes met mine, they narrowed.
 Part of me was aware I should have been scared, but I was enjoying myself.
 Whatever pain I might receive didn’t factor; I had wanted to hurt this wicked little redhead since the first time I’d seen her, since her hand reached out seductively toward Chevelle and collected my ruby.

I probably shouldn't have felt quite so happy about it, but I was pretty sure from the way they'd been looking at me that I'd been the source of their gossip.
 When the bell finally released us, I couldn't avoid Britney any longer.
 "Adri...ana, why didn't you tell me?"
 I didn't answer for several seconds, not sure I'd actually heard her right.
 "Tell you what?"
 "Fine, play coy.
 I just think you should know it's pretty lame for me to find all that stuff out second hand.
 We're best friends; you should totally have trusted me enough to tell me."
 Apparently I'd only thought the anger was under control.
 It frothed beneath the surface right now, anxious for a reason to bite someone's head off, and Britney was the preferred target.

The instant before he struck, Steed ducked into a squat and spun, taking Grey’s legs out from under him.
 I flinched.
 Grey was gone again, this time reappearing midair in a flip above Steed’s head, reaching down to tag him on the way by.
 It was a loud smack.
 I was sure it had stung.
 Steed stood still, focused on the spot where Grey had landed and was flickering in and out of view.
 I made an effort to consider possible responses in my head, but was coming up blank.
 The nerves were gone.
 I found myself wanting Steed to win and leaned with his strikes, tensing as if they were my own.
 Grey bounded through the air once more, showing off, confident in his evident lead, and then a small rock rose at chest height in front of Steed.

Assuming my mom takes off for the night, I'll go, but only on the condition that you behave."
 I managed to make it to the door without my knees knocking together, but it was a close thing.
 I'd been scared sick when he'd been about to kiss me, but it had at least been something I'd been dreaming about off and on for years.
 I wasn't sure I was ready for the other things he was starting to imply.
 Chapter 20 There were a couple of times between Monday and the end of the week where I didn't think I was going to survive having to worry about whether or not I'd be able to sneak out to Brandon's party.
 My dreams had taken a decidedly odd turn.
 I'd had the lucid, vivid dreams every single night, but my guilty conscience seemed to be working overtime.
 At least that was all I could assume.
 I woke up flustered, with vague memories of Alec.
 My best guess was that I was trying to defend myself after having argued with his little sister.

She was trying to make me jealous.
 I was suddenly furious.
 She’d poisoned me and now this.
 I wanted to burn her right then and there.
 I caught Chevelle’s expression as I glared at her.
 He had seen what she was doing, knew her motives most likely, but I could tell he thought it had worked.
 He thought I was jealous.
 Perfect.
 I smelled something odd and glanced down.

I know you don't want to get me any more deeply involved with 'dangerous information', but it really sucks sometimes."
 Alec gazed at me for several seconds, and then sighed.
 "If you would like to come watch, you may.
 Give us half an hour, and then ask Donovan to show you the way."
 I felt my face break into a huge smile, but he held a hand up to forestall my thanks.
 "This is all still very much against my better judgment, but I'm finding it increasingly hard to refuse you the things you want the most."
 "Somehow I find that hard to believe.
 Even if it were true, you're hardly the type to give away the upper hand by coming out and telling me so."
 Alec's eyes had taken on the serious, resigned expression that'd become disturbingly commonplace lately.

She opened her eyes, squinting at the two of us.
 “Morning.” “Good morning Emily, sleep well?” I asked, wondering if she had the same type of dream as we did.
 She shrugged.
 “I slept soundly, why?” “Nothing, just curious.” “Okay,” she stood up and tip toed towards Jason.
 “Now the best part, waking up the grump.” She bent over close to his ear.
 She took in a deep breath and then yelled at the top of her lungs, “PIE!” Jason jumped up so fast that Emily had to jump back to avoid getting hit in the head.
 He almost fell backward but he steadied himself against the wall.
 One of his knives slid into his hand but by the time he realized what was going on, we were all laughing hard I was getting the hiccups.
 Jason panted out each word, “That...is...not...funny!” He glared at Emily so hard she must of thought that he had laser eyes.
 Emily was holding herself and trying to stop laughing so she could speak.

But the sinful heart can’t find happiness.
 And God, he assured us, wants his creatures to get happy, which is why Christ said we must be born again, so he could give us new moral natures, new affections, new objectives, and new directions.
 What planted the hook in me was: according to Billy Graham, when you make your decision for Christ, you do it for the sake of the nation and the world.
 Without God, any nation will perish.
 And a nation is only as strong as its people.
 A better world requires better nations of better people.
 Christ can make us into those people.
 Billy Graham had injected some hope into at least one heart often shamed by its selfish and ornery ways.
 When he asked for all who would surrender to come to the altar, I stood and followed the auburn haired babe.
 About halfway down, I heard Cliff.

"Sorry, that's touching on some of the things I'm not supposed to tell you."
 I shrugged, pretending indifference.
 "How soon will we know if it's really bad or just a little bad?"
 "I don't know.

 That's probably where Alec is right now actually.
 Brandon's people are always skirting around the edge of our territory, but tonight they'll be out in greater numbers than normal.
 If things don't boil over now, it's pretty much guaranteed that there will be some kind of confrontation Monday at school."
 The word confrontation reached out and grabbed me.
 It took a second before I realized it was dragging up memories of the near-fight between Alec and half his pack.

 "Not that I'm complaining, mind you, but why the sudden change?"
 Alec gave me a lopsided smile of his own.
 "My death is nearly certain, but there's always a chance I'll somehow survive.
 As unlikely as that is, I don't want to survive and then find I've poisoned you against me.
 I won't stop you."

This increase is now showing signs of reversal.
 These average figures disguise significant differences in performance of countries within the OECD.
 Since 1950, Japan’s employment rate has risen from 43 per cent to around 50 per cent, while unemployment has remained in the 1 to 3 per cent range.
 The overall proportion of the population employed in the European Community has declined by 1 per cent since 1965 and is presently just under 41 per cent, but the percentage of the working age population employed has remained more or less constant over the past three decades, at 67 per cent, whereas in other OECD regions it has risen significantly – to exceed 75 per cent in North America, Scandinavia and Japan.
 Europe’s lower labour participation rate is attributable to a number of factors.
 A far higher percentage of the European workforce was engaged in agriculture 25 years ago and has since shifted to non-agricultural sectors, an adjustment that occurred in the United States during earlier decades.
 During the 1980s Europe chose a high-wage path to growth, passing on the benefits to the existing workforce but creating relatively few new jobs; whereas the United States, with a similar economic growth rate over the decade, showed lower income growth per worker, but a steadily rising employment rate.
 Europe is now confronted with the need for structural adjustment to compensate.
 In the United States, the extent of the unemployment problem is partially disguised in the form of low-wage jobs, which distribute total income over a larger number of workers.
 Twenty per cent of all full-time US workers have incomes that fall below the official poverty line for a family of four, though only a quarter of these live in households whose total income is below the poverty line.

 I removed one of my arrows and put my bow on the ground.
 I walked over to Seth and pulled his sword out of its sheath.
 He grabbed for it but I already had it in my hands.
 I put the tip against the arrow and carved the same sign as the one on the wall.
 Then I tossed Seth's sword back at him, which he caught without a problem, and picked up my bow.
 I notched the carved arrow and released it.

 I didn't think I'd ever seen the boy before, but Jasmin was easily recognizable, even half-hidden amid all the intermittently-functioning cooling units that lived on this end of the building.
 I couldn't see much beyond the boy's wild red hair, but even that was enough to tell he wasn't completely comfortable.
 I wanted to turn around and go back the other way, but there was a chance that Jasmin had already seen me, and if so I couldn't afford to look like I was scared of her.
 The fact I actually was terrified she was going to snap and start trying to kill people was irrelevant.
 If I could convince her I wasn't scared, I was less likely to get hurt.

“Uh… hello.” “I am…” I hesitated, unsure if I should tell him my name; I was on the run, after all.
 I decided on a replacement.
 “Lizzy.” He seemed to like that.
 “I’m Noble.” Now I was confused.
 “You are noble?” He shook his head.
 “Noble is my name.
 Noble Grand.” “That is a large name.
 You are a ruler among your people?” He laughed.
 “No, no.
 Noble is my given name, passed down for generations.

Spanish was both better and worse.
 Better because without Alec sitting six feet away from me I was able to think about something other than him, worse because we had a pop quiz and I barely placed in the A- range despite having spent a fair amount of time on my vocabulary.
 Math was plain and simply burning up too much time.
 Something needed to change because my only hope of going to college was to get a scholarship, or load up on student loans, and I had no desire to graduate sixty thousand dollars in debt and spend the next fifteen years trying to pay it all off.
 By the time I met up with Britney in the hall I was emotionally exhausted and could feel an attack hovering in the wings.
 Much as I'd have liked to, I couldn't continue to blow her off.
 She was my only friend, and I definitely didn't want her spreading the kind of rumors about me that she routinely spread about everyone else.
 "Wow, you look like crap.
 Are you going to collapse like you did last night?"
 "Thanks, Brit.

Intellect and others.

 Eric vs. Max Von Sydow
 Back on the road my thoughts pick up where they left off in San Luis Obispo, and I wonder if Brother Lawrence perceived his constant companion as the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit.
 Maybe my problem with adoring God is my habit of looking at, or for, God the Father, who in my vocabulary is easy to respect, admire, stand in awe of, or even worship, but is hard for me to adore.
 God, to me, looks more like a vapor.
 And his whispering voice either sounds too much like my own to be surely authentic, or else it’s so soft, I’m not often sure I heard right.
 The Jesus I used to picture looked like a young Max Von Sydow in The Greatest Story Ever Told, and his expressions appeared more posed or acted than honestly human.
 But now he's beginning to look more like Eric.

 "You're going to protect me from Cassie and Jasmin?"
 His face was completely serious as he nodded.
 "If necessary, but I need to know what else was said so I know how serious things are.
 Jasmin had a really tough childhood.
 Her mom was killed while she was really young, and her father was pretty abusive.
 Alec's mother did a good thing by bringing her into their home and trying to give her a decent life, but she's not completely stable."
 My laugh had a touch more hysteria in it than I'd meant to let slip through.
 Brandon didn't look at me like I was losing it though.
 "You're not the only one to realize she's dangerous, it's just that Alec's family has a lot of influence, and so far she's avoided doing anything they couldn't cover up."

I had, after all, succeeded in growing only days ago.
 I concentrated as hard as I could and, though nothing flitted out of the shelves and onto my desk, I had a strong feeling I knew where the documents were.
 It also could have been that I knew where they had fallen from the day before.
 Regardless, I made my way over and took a few volumes and scrolls back to my secluded table.
 I was able to find several documents on the northern clans and even one of the missing pages of names—L.
 I had spread them out on the table and was studiously examining them when a shadow crossed my desk.
 I realized someone was standing there and distractedly glanced up to see who.
 My instinct to breathe deserted me.
 It was Chevelle Vattier.

 Rodregas almost thought he might have some AElf blood.
 It also looked like he might have a broken nose from the previous day’s competition.
 The young man did very well, hitting all five targets.
 His shot on the moving target only nicked the edge, still impressive.
 Rodregas stepped forward and picked up the bow.
 It felt light and a little awkward.
 Rodregas focused on his breathing.
 He had five targets and five arrows.
 He shot at the target shaped like a man.

The creativity and inventiveness they have exhibited in seeking an alternative in the past may quite possibly lead them to discover that better social system which both East and West are in need of.
 Viewed from an evolutionary perspective, we may surmise the general direction and likely destination of that quest.
 The requirements of the state and the market must eventually give way to the needs of people.
 The values of authority and money must be supplanted by acceptance of the fundamental value of the human being.
 Human welfare and well-being must become the central determinants of social policy, in place of the compulsions of the centrally controlled state bureaucracy and the decentralized market pricing mechanism.
 The first essential step in that direction is a commitment by market economies to guarantee the right of every citizen to employment.
 Neither the mechanism of state planning and control nor the mechanism of market prices can accomplish this on their own.
 A blending of their values and methods – freed from the blinkers of dogma and the determinism of limited imagination – can lead us to the answer.
 Wider Perspective on Transitions
 The outcome of all great social transformations – of which the present instance ranks in magnitude and importance with that of the French Revolution and the movement which freed India and so many other former colonies from imperialism, economic exploitation and cultural domination – depends on the degree to which individuals and institutions within the society have been prepared to understand, accept and respond to the new environment ushered in by the transition.

Population, which was perceived as a liability not long ago, now appears to be an asset.
 In reality, population, like nuclear energy and so many other things, is neutral.
 Its value depends on what we human beings make of it.
 Changing Demographic Profile of the West: Demographic studies indicate that steep declines in the growth of population in Europe, Japan and USA will create acute labour shortages and unprecedented long-term demand for migration of foreign workers or transplantation of work to developing countries.
 UN and other studies estimate that Europe would have to accept 150 million new immigrants over the next 25 years in order to maintain the present levels of working population and Japan would need to admit 600,000 immigrants annually for the next 50 years in order to maintain the size of its working population at the 1995 level.
 The US labour force is projected to stop growing by 2013.
 These findings support the view of the India Vision 2020 report that “This trend will further accelerate the outsourcing of production of goods and services to locations where infrastructure, ease of doing business, quality, costs and availability of labour are most attractive, which will be beneficial for many labour surplus countries like India.”
 Expanding World Trade: Trade is playing an increasing role in the economic growth of developing countries.
 Economic integration with the global economy has become a compelling necessity for every country.
 The share of trade in global GDP rose from 12 per cent in 1970 to 29 per cent in 2001.

A vision of the Grand Council cloaks circling me was convincing enough, but he continued.
 “You will not know their thoughts; you must be ready for any attack.” I nodded, even though part of me was certain there was a less painful way.
 The rock came at me again.
 I couldn’t respond quick enough, couldn’t counter and hold on to a galloping horse in the instant it took him to decide.
 It wasn’t dangerous, but it was like being slapped, and the irritation had me itching to burn something.
 The volley continued and whenever my anger showed, the rock came harder, faster, so I tried to control the emotion or at least hide it.
 That was the hardest part.
 Eventually, I found the best defense was to block the attacks by deflecting them with other objects.
 His magic was too powerful to counter directly and he’d prevented me from ducking away.
 When I was blocking about half the strikes successfully, he pocketed the stone and progressed with sticks, water, fire, anything he found on the trail.

So where else would he be going?
 Before I had, regrettably, torched the documents, I had seen Junnie noted as his contact.
 My pulse sped at the idea that he might be going to her, to get her help in finding me.
 If he was my watcher, I’d be his responsibility, and she was the only one who knew me at all aside from Fannie.
 He was a good fifty yards farther as I considered.
 My feet were moving before I’d actually decided to follow him.
 My determination faltered.
 How far should I go?
 What if he wasn’t going to find Junnie?

At last, when Harruq was sure Qurrah would not bring up the subject, he spoke.

 Qurrah chuckled, but it was mirthless.

"Are you sure?
 I mean, it looks pretty real to me."
 "They're definitely being careful not to kill each other.
 Isaac could've connected with his claws instead of his fist."
 Jasmin and Jessica were circling each other now.
 It reminded me of a fight I'd seen between two feral dogs while I was still in grade school.
 The dogs had circled for five or ten seconds, and then one had thrown himself at the other.
 A neighbor had broken the fight up with a few thrown stones before it'd come to a grisly end, but it'd been obvious once the first dog had latched onto his opponent's throat that it was only a matter of time before the smaller dog would've died.
 This was exactly the same, only it happened faster as Jasmin blurred into motion.
 One moment she was growling at Jess from a distance of more than five feet, the next instant she was on top of Jess, and her teeth were latched around the smaller wolf's throat.

 "You barely remember him.

 For a second I thought he was going to argue with her.
 His tired smile had the feel of resignation, of something that'd been well argued over the years.

But clearly from Imeralda’s introduction, this Nymph was well known and powerful among his people, and he had saved both Rodregas’ and Doi’van’s lives.
 There was an awkward moment until Doi’van appeared at the door.
 He walked with the help of a tall walking stick.
 His arm and side were both covered in bandages.
 Durien followed him in with a heavy stool, which Doi’van quickly sat down on.
 The old healer immediately left the room.
 “Rodregas, you look much better than last I saw you.
 But what is so important that it takes me away from a very important nap?” Doi’van’s body looked worse for the wear, but his eyes showed his natural curiosity and intelligence.
 Rodregas did not think he actually minded coming over to his room.
 Rodregas smiled and thought that given the way Doi’van talked about pain when training them with the staff, that he must be immune to mere pain anyhow.

Left of them were council members and, as I glanced right, Chevelle walked in to stand at attention, facing the council table.
 I could hear others enter behind us, presumably witnesses, and I wondered if Junnie was among them.
 “Elfreda Georgiana Suzetta Glaforia stands before High Council…” The formal tone of the speaker severed my rambling thoughts, dragging me back to a frightening reality.
 What would they do to me?
 How bad could the punishment be for sneaking into a library?
 And stealing a book.
 Maybe it wasn’t even about that, maybe Fannie had told them I broke into the vault.
 But they were my family’s things too, it couldn’t be that bad.

 She blushed.
 "Oh, we stare.”  He grinned, but then his face grew sober; being able to see from her perspective made him realize that, as much as he enjoyed looking at women on the beach, the changes in modesty reflected a decay in morals that would probably make her uncomfortable.
 "Morals are one of the things that have changed a lot in the last 84 years.
 So I guess the 1920s have something on us."
 He swallowed the last of his tea.

 "My sincere apologies that we weren't better hosts.
 Please let me know if there is anything you need to make your stay here more comfortable."
 I stammered out a thanks as Donovan released my hand.
 The rest of Alec's friends were already disappearing, Isaac and Jessica around back towards the garden, while James and Dominic were already inside his car, and backing down the lane.
 Alec took my hand as Donovan opened the front door for us.
 He walked with a definite limp, one that was all the more painful when contrasted against his otherwise graceful movements.
 I looked questioningly at Alec, but he shook his head, so I stayed quiet as he led me into the house.

The higher we rose up the mountain, the more treacherous the jagged rock became.
 I felt every step, holding tight as the horse’s hooves slipped and jumped.
 The haze thickened, keeping the view both ahead and behind close.
 It gathered in my hair, leaving it a matted mess with the single braid—Ruby’s handiwork—dripping condensation over the shoulder of my cloak.
 I decided to practice as we rode, closing my eyes to sink partially into my horse, still alert to my own self and the outside world.
 It was there, leading my horse and seeing through his eyes, that the pain struck.
 It came on instantaneously, hitting me like a blade, cutting, shearing.
 It was accompanied by sharpness of sound as well.
 My ears were in excruciating pain.
 The horse dropped, his head smacked to the ground and I watched through his eyes as he hit.

 Rick's kiss was making her tremble.
 She returned it briefly and then pulled away, hiding her face against his shoulder in confusion.
 How could she like Rick's kiss more than Davis'?
 How could his kiss make her feel so hot and weak?
 Rick drew in a shaky breath, laying his cheek against her hair.
 That one small, hesitant kiss had been so exciting that he knew he'd be lost if she ever kissed him the way he wanted.
 And he knew himself well enough and was honest enough to admit that it wasn't just because she was beautiful and sexy.

Some were very emotional and some were humorous, all were heartfelt and meaningful descriptions of their individual challenges to reach that next level.
 It was clear that everyone here, whether they were staff or student, had the ability to impact anyone they touched.
 When the moment arrived for this evening’s three graduates to speak, a young lady in her early twenties walked to the front of the room with her head down.
 When she looked up, she smiled nervously.
 She had no family present.
 She told everyone how her mother told her how ugly she was her whole life and told her she was worthless, how she attempted to numb the pain with the drugs she took.
 How she became addicted to the drugs, and prostituted herself to pay for her habit.
 She said that she took all the drugs she could because she knew she would never be alive to see her twenty-first birthday.
 She smiled and announced that she was now twenty-one.
 She thanked one staff member after another and one student after another, each for something specific they had contributed to her healing.

 “But we were out of options and it was the only thing I could think of.” Then she added with more confidence, “Plus, while everyone knows a knight might learn a bit of magic, a sorcerer never learns to fight.
 They have servants for that.” The three shared a smile at that.
 Rodregas was very glad that he had insisted that she learn the fundamentals of blade work.
 “So what now?” he asked.
 “Now we go see if we can get some greater sigils,” said Doi’van.

It was probably custom made and was solid, if unspectacular, quality armor.
 The braided, lacquered leather reinforced with the steel scales provided decent protection for most fights.
 This style of armor was vulnerable to a highly skilled swordsman.
 But for someone wanting some protection from the dangers of the road, it was better than most civilian armor.
 There were matching pants and even boots.
 He quickly dressed and felt much better once armored.
 He had spent most of his adult life in armor; he just could not relax when he wore only clothes.
 Rodregas then looked around; the keep armory was pretty basic with casks of arrows and spears, and some of the older used short swords and bows on the wall.
 There were only two truly powerful weapons like those used by a member of the Immortal Guards – the soldiers that enforced the rule of the Immortalist Guild of the Celestial Path who ruled all the Eastern Kingdoms and neither of these weapons were kept in the armory.
 He looked over to the short swords laying on one of the tables and picked two of them up; they felt a little weird.

She stuck her tongue out, “What do you have against sun-tanning penguins?” “Nothing!” I smiled to myself.
 I shouldn’t be talking; I was wearing pajamas covered in little pigs.
 Emily leaned back to turn off her desk light.
 It clicked off and I gazed outside one more time before turning around to go to bed.
 “Night Emily.” I yawned.
 Emily didn’t reply because her face was pushed up against the window.
 Her body was ridged and she didn’t move.
 I crawled over to the window.
 “What is it, Em?” I whispered, a nervous feeling creeping into my stomach.
 She backed away from the window so I could see.

He was still holding his hand out to me.
 My back pressed against the wall, and as he took a step forward I became wholly aware of how small and isolated the library space I had chosen was.
 He turned the outstretched hand palm up, indicating the stool beside me, as if that had been his intention all along.
 “May I?” I nodded once and he slid onto the stool, facing me, not the table spread with documents.
 Have I still not spoken?
 His eyes moved down to the pendant against my chest and then quickly back to my face, as if he had committed an indiscretion.
 We sat there for a few more moments, but my words would not return, not with this imposing stranger inches before me.
 When he finally spoke again, I realized his offer of help wasn’t a request.
 “Let’s begin with histories.” He flicked the middle finger of his left hand and a thick ivory tome flew from a shelf, opened, and steadied between us as if on a table.
 There was something so wrong about it, but I couldn’t say why.

"Enjoy the rest of your night, and don't lose hope on Les Misérables.
 You never know when you're going to beat the odds."
 Shaking my head in amazement at Rachel's unfailing optimism, I turned to thank Alec for the ride.
 He was scowling a little again, which almost made me get out without saying anything.
 My thanks received only a nod in return, and then Rachel was waving goodbye as they backed down the lane.
 The Jeep was gone, of course.
 I wiped away the beginnings of perspiration as I climbed our steps.
 It was still hot enough outside that I knew it was going to be miserable inside.
 By the time I reached the door I was contemplating just finding a decent tree and spending the afternoon outside.
 The sight of a white envelope, barely visible against the off-white door, was enough to drive those thoughts out of my head.

The hot-rodders had a “bad boy” reputation affiliated with drug use.
 Many hot-rodders did drugs and many of us sold drugs (usually to the jocks).
 It was the days of cocaine and pot, and I saw and consumed my share of it.
 Thomas became one of the bigger drug dealers in town.
 His house was filled with booze and drugs of all types.
 Cocaine was the most popular, that, and pot; but magic mushrooms and acid were also available.
 It was the late seventies, after all.
 We were also surrounded by some pretty tough guys and nobody really messed with us.
 After years of sparring with a two hundred pound Greek, I was pretty tough myself.
 We would host evening boxing matches in the living room of the house I rented with my friends.

Maybe, eventually, not knowing-- Rick staggered, everything suddenly going black.
 Gasping, he gripped the edge of the desk and then turned to jerk the drawer open again and grab the papers.
 Nothing had changed.
 Nothing had changed.
 He threw the papers onto the desk and ran downstairs and out into the garden.
 Forcing himself to calm down, he closed his eyes and began to think about 1927.
 He imagined Marie in the dress she'd worn to and from 1927, imagined her in a speakeasy, imagined her listening to the radio in a room without a TV.
 He had a hard time concentrating and remaining calm, but he continued to conjure up the images, trying to fill in details .

Sylvia was an invalid, and rather crazy, given to dark moods and paranoid notions.
 She was the mother of my best friend Eric.
 I had come to help with chores and listen to her rant about whatever injustices she had recently suffered.
 Her apartment was dingy and cluttered, mostly with books.
 Eric’s high school senior-class picture, blown up to poster size and framed, hung facing the entry door.
 As I entered, Sylvia's fierce green eyes taunted me.
 She demanded, “What’s the purpose of life?” “Give me a minute,” I said.
 “To know love and serve God,” she declared, with a hiss on "serve."
 Later she would tell me she got that answer from a priest in an orphanage where, as a teenager terrified of her own sister, she had gone to seek refuge.
 Sylvia’s challenge sent me to 1 John 4:8.

But I had been right.
 Illustrations and descriptions matched what I had seen.
 I know I took a risk extending Rune’s spell further, but I did not want to get caught, definitely not followed.
 I wondered if my sister was still at the original camp.
 Surely she wasn’t bright enough to figure it out.
 And apparently she wasn’t willing to tell anyone.
 I was returning to the spot I had found the humans the previous day when I ran across one of them alone.
 I hid myself behind a patch of brush to watch him.
 He had a lovely complexion with a hint of bronze and cropped dark brown hair with a few tiny streaks of blond just around his face.
 He looked less like the others I had been watching.

 “Again, I do as I wish,” Qurrah whispered.
 “Who are you talking to?” Harruq asked.
 “Qurrah, what’s going on?”
 “Nothing,” Qurrah said.
 He tore his gaze back to the fight.
 More orcs had pushed inward, leaving them bunched in a wide circle.
 They flung themselves against the surrounding guards.
 Again he felt a cold chill, this time creeping across his arms like frost spiders.

At least we should think about this a little bit.” I pushed the paper of warnings in front of her face.
 “Fine,” she snatched the paper out of my hands.
 “We’ll meet Jazell, okay?
 Are you happy now?
 Then we’ll go back to soaking each other randomly.” “Yes, I’m happy.” I didn’t call a truce for the warnings.
 I did it because that’s when I’d talk to Seth and get his secret out of him.
 Then maybe I could help him and stop having to watch his miserable face.
 Emily made a face and left the room to dial Jason’s number and tell him about the meeting.
 I waited patiently for her to come back in my room.
 I can’t wait long because I have a tendency to go crazy, so I walked up to my window sill and looked at the sky.

 We were already pulling into the parking lot.
 He must have been driving even faster than normal.

 Brandon smoothly pulled the bulky car in between a pair of SUVs and cut the engine before turning and hitting me with the full force of his gray eyes.

 In bed… at Ruby’s.

 “The night is young.

His expression softened a little as he reached into the small bag mounted on the fuel tank, and handed me a bottle of water.
 I hadn't even realized I was thirsty until that second.
 "I'm sorry, Adriana.
 I know I can depend on you, this is just important enough that I needed to make sure you understood what's riding on your discretion."
 I finished with the first third of the bottle, and then nodded.
 "I won't say anything.
 What exactly are we going to see?"
 "Not a what, but a who."
 Much like he'd done when we'd been fleeing from my house, Alec picked me up and then slung me around so I could wrap my legs around his waist, and my arms around his neck and chest.
 This time Alec wasn't sprinting, but he still set out at a pace that made conversation impossible, so I just relaxed into him and enjoyed being so close for a second time today.

It was possible, it turned out, to be rational but still completely paralyzed by indecision.
 The girl was sobbing now, and my heart felt like it was about to tear itself into pieces.
 The creak of the bathroom door opening should have been a relief.
 I was expecting the tension to evaporate once there were more witnesses.
 I couldn't have been more wrong.
 The air had felt heavy before, now it felt alive, like ground zero of a lightning strike a split second before the soil was blackened by three hundred thousand volts.
 "Get out."
 "Go to hell."

He had brought a proper crow bar from his visit to the smith’s and made short work of the laboratory door.
 The room had several large circles in the floor and tables and shelves along the side.
 The shelves held bones and bowls of strange fluids and other items whose uses he could not imagine.
 Anything that felt foul he threw into the fireplace, after getting a good flame going.
 Several books and strange containers ended up in the fire, though he did find two books that felt of magic that he kept.
 He also found a small statue of a strange green mechanical frog that had that magic tingle to it.
 He could not imagine its use; it appeared a simple toy, but he put it in his pile to take.
 There was a heavy oak cabinet in the corner which he forced open.
 Inside were large pottery containers, which he had seen before.
 They held some of the magic powders used to make the circles that were so important to many of the most powerful of the Immortalist’s spells.

 My subconscious had keyed in on the one scene guaranteed to make me feel miserable.
 "Was that close to your house in Minnesota?

 I didn't even have a chance to try and fight the attack.
 By the time I realized I was in trouble, papers were flying off my desk and the floor was racing up to meet me.
 Rather than swimming around in blackness like I normally did when collapsed, this time there was just nothing.
 One second I was falling, the next I was opening my eyes and looking up at Alec.
 "Stand back, everyone, and let me through!"
 It took a few seconds to realize the sub was the one yelling.

“The good news is that while the tip of the lance did slice into your chest a bit, it is almost healed thanks to what Jordaan did,” said Doi’van standing above him.

 The spare lances were gone.
 He had lost.
 Doi’van was of course referring to the healing sigil.
 He wisely did not say it out loud as every squire there would have been asking about where they had gotten one.

 Britney had positioned herself so she could see Brandon.
 As a consequence, I could see Alec's entire group, and I was amazed by their reaction to Cassie's belligerence.
 Jasmin's pretty lips drew back in something that looked almost like a snarl, and she'd tensed up so tightly she was almost shaking.
 For a heartbeat I thought Jasmin would launch herself at the other girl, but Alec reached over without looking, and grabbed her arm.
 A stocky, Middle Eastern-looking boy to Alec's right looked like he wanted to act as well, but he was looking at Alec, and an almost imperceptible headshake stopped him.
 I'd been so busy watching the byplay behind Rachel that I'd missed the last two exchanges between her and Cassie.
 Whatever had been said must have been bad though.
 Rachel was shaking, and the blonde looked like someone about to pull the wings off a butterfly.

Coping with the environmental problems to preserve the ecological foundations essential for sustainable agriculture is an area in which government has special responsibilities and must play a leading role on an ongoing basis.
 Regulating the diversion of prime farm land for non-farm uses, expansion of irrigation capacity, control of groundwater exploitation, major programmes for reforestation and to prevent or reverse desertification, and regulation of pesticide use can only be effectively planned, monitored and regulated by governments.
 Comprehensive Strategies
 In this and previous chapters, we have tried to present an integrated perspective of the political, economic and technological factors that need to be taken into account in formulating a comprehensive approach to the issues of peace, food and employment.
 In an effort to illustrate the potential efficacy of this approach in a country representing nearly 25 per cent of the world’s poor, ICPF conducted an in-depth country level study in India to evolve a strategy for stimulating massive increases in job growth and food production (see box pp.
 122–24).
 PROSPERITY 2000 STRATEGY FOR INDIA
 The potential for accelerating job creation and increasing food production through a mix of the strategies discussed in this report is illustrated by the strategy which ICPF has proposed to achieve full employment in India and thereby to raise the entire population above the poverty line by generating additional employment opportunities for 100 million persons in the coming decade.
 This strategy utilizes agriculture as an engine for growth by accelerating the development of commercial agriculture, agro-industry and agro-exports.
 It calls for a shift in thinking concerning agriculture from production for survival and subsistence to production for maximum and sustainable profit, from emphasis on meeting minimum needs to realizing maximum potentials, from commodity-based to resource-based planning.

Tiffanie had been clean and sober since her last relapse in the rehab center.
 They smiled at each other and commented on their vast physical changes.
 They knew their life as a couple was over and that they had both gone their separate ways, while both going in the same positive direction—off drugs—despite astronomical odds.
 The conversation they had was all about sobriety and how wonderful it was to be clean.
 They both had big smiles and clear eyes and they looked like a couple of healthy young people, and that is exactly what they were.
 I also took the opportunity to arrange a meeting at a Starbucks, a reunion of sorts.
 I had stayed in contact with Officer White by e-mailing him updates on Brandon’s progress as a courtesy to him and as a bit of a reward.
 I thanked him for busting my son.
 Brandon entered rehab about a month after I did the bust so he wasn’t on the streets for long after it all came crashing down.
 I think without the bust, he could have got killed for stealing from other drug dealers or been captured in a larger bust that he couldn’t negotiate his way out of.

In each area, a study should be conducted of resources and economic potentials, existing institutions and infrastructure, current levels of skill and social attitudes regarding the market system.
 Detailed strategies should be devised to educate the public about untapped opportunities, strengthen the institutional infrastructure, impart needed skills, establish catalytic demonstrations and encourage multiplication of successful new activities.
 A plan should be adopted at the forthcoming UN Social Summit for establishing model district programmes in Eastern and Central European countries.
 Plans for transition should cover all of the factors listed above, providing trained personnel to assist in the establishment and initial operation of new institutions and systems.
 7.Plan for institutional development: An assessment of the type and functioning of existing institutions and economic systems should be compiled to identify missing links that need to be provided to support the transition.
 Based on this study, a master plan should be drawn up for establishing the necessary institutions and systems in each country.
 In order to prepare a cadre of managers for private sector industry and institutions, specialized institutes of management should be set up in each country.
 8.Launch a massive programme to impart new skills and attitudes to the population: In countries where private enterprise was extinguished for decades, entrepreneurial, financial and marketing skills can be extremely limited.
 An analysis should be undertaken of the types and levels of skills needed for transition to a market system, covering areas such as entrepreneurship, management, national and international marketing, strategic business planning, finance, quality control, product development, production technology, design, and human resource development.
 Experience in former colonial nations where entrepreneur ship was also stifled for a long period indicates that a profound change in attitude is necessary before people will risk leaving or forego seeking salaried and pensioned jobs in favour of self-employment, even when the salaried jobs are scarce or unavailable.

The demise of the Cold War offers a unique opportunity to eliminate nuclear weapons while the political atmosphere is favourable.
 If the world now intends to uphold democracy and human rights as inalienable values, then the human right to live without the threat of a nuclear holocaust must be proclaimed and made inviolable.
 A durable non-proliferation regime can only be constructed on the basis of the universal abolition of nuclear weapons.
 Manufacture and possession of nuclear weapons must be banned.
 Use of such weapons must be outlawed as a crime against humanity.
 First use of such weapons by any power should automatically invoke the strongest collective security measures under the UN Security Council.
 The decision on whether to permit the continued existence of nuclear weapons is of too great importance to the future of humanity to be left to the discretion of one or a few member nations of the international community.
 Under the present structure of the UN, the only body with authority to act is the Security Council, but the veto power of the five permanent members deprives other nations of an effective voice.
 The proposal to ban completely the possession and use of nuclear weapons should be put before the Council.
 The right of veto should be rescinded with respect to this most crucial issue.

There was a good-size tree not far in front of the two of them.
 Rodregas put his back to it and drew his two short swords and then did the most difficult thing he could do in this situation.
 He looked at Doi’van and not at the caravan.
 There was no need for both of them to be peeking around the trees at the caravan, though he desperately wanted to get a good look at the caravan to establish their odds.
 The dice had been rolled.
 Rodregas had been learning to trust Doi’van and knew his life was now in Doi’van hands.
 If Imeralda had missed something critical and they should not attack, it was for Doi’van to catch.
 Rodregas watched Doi’van, watched for him to raise the bow and start the fight.
 When the guards charged in to stop the shooting, then it would be his turn to strike.
 Rodregas would have to take on as many of the slavers and guards as possible.

Understanding came suddenly and would not be denied.
 I scoffed at myself humorlessly as my words taunted me—just harmless fun… what could it hurt?
 For half a second, I wanted to scream.
 And then my hands found their way to my stomach and rested there.
 I drew in a sharp intake of breath.
 I hadn’t noticed I had gotten so deeply involved in the story.
 I needed to rest, to finish my recovery and break the bonds.
 But I couldn’t seem to step away.
 I was unnaturally calm when they finally came for me.
 I knew they would recognize the signs.

A government that fosters external aggression or cannot contain domestic violence and civil strife, that cannot create conditions in which its people can feed themselves or even receive outside assistance, fails the test of sovereignty.
 Under these circumstances, the international community, through the UN, should have the right and accept the responsi bility to intervene appropriately.
 The need of the hour is not to undermine the legitimate right of nations to self-determination, but rather to protect that right by more clearly demarcating its legitimate boundaries against the highly visible challenges being posed by forces of disintegration and fragmentation from within.
 The current tendency for states to fragment along ethnic lines cannot be handled by any abstract principle of international law.
 It depends on the understanding and will of people.
 The evolution of larger, heterogeneous national units functioning under principles of equality is an outstanding product of civilization that should not and cannot be reversed without great damage to the general welfare of humanity.
 The only solution is to work constantly to educate the public in all countries to understand the benefits of national integration and international cooperation.
 The implications of this view will be endorsed by some and opposed by others.
 Acceptance must be fostered through education and discussion rather than unilateral forced initiative.

He had hoped they could pick off enough with the Black Yew bows to keep odds like this against them.
 Rodregas glanced to the ground hoping to see the previous guard’s blue steel long sword.
 It would do a lot to give him at least a chance against these odds, but it was nowhere to be seen.
 The dead guard’s small shield, though, was near his feet.
 Rodregas quickly grabbed it as he made some room and switched his short sword to his right and the shield to his left.
 This time they spread out and started to circle.
 Rodregas took a chance before they got too close and glanced over at Doi’van.
 In one of those weird moments that happen in battle, he saw the path between them was open.
 He was also backing up, surrounded by three more foes.
 “At least they are all slavers.” Rodregas thought.

"I just wish I was the one you wanted most."
 She caught her breath, covering her mouth with her hand and running from the room.
 Rick hated himself for pushing her like that, but he couldn't seem to help it.
 He was desperate.
 He knew now that he could keep her here, but how could he do that when she wanted so much to go home?
 He ordered Chinese, and Marie came down just after it arrived.
 She saw the cartons and silently went to pour two glasses of tea.

“What next?” “Mushrooms.”  He handed her a carton.
 Rick added some seasonings to the sauce he was stirring.
 Glancing at Marie, he saw that she had a mushroom on the cutting board but was just staring at it.
 “Is something wrong?” “What?” “You’re staring at that mushroom pretty intently.” “Oh.
 No—I was just thinking.”  She began slicing the mushroom.
 “About what?” Shaking her hair out of her face, she looked up at him.
 “Why do you think this happened to me?
 I mean, we’ve tried to figure out how I can get back, but we don’t even know why it happened.” “I don’t know, Marie.
 I still can’t really believe it happened.
 If you hadn’t been scared half to death, I would have thought you were playing a joke on me.” She smiled a bit.

This was a flat metal gameboard which you plugged into the wall and it vibrated and your defensive and offensive formations danced together (or apart) in random, chaotic tremblings, until the player with the ball (a small plastic chip) was shaken off the playing field.
 I think I piled rubber bricks on the game (although rubber shouldn't give you a shock, should it?)

 Moved to a city beside a great rolling river, the color of my eyes at dusk, mud flecked with green.
 A city of irony and pity, a Bluff City.
 Actually, at first we lived in Raleigh, which is kind of like to Memphis what Lewiston was to Niagara Falls, except, at that time, Raleigh was an emerald isle, a rolling, green neighborhood, with lots of kids and bikes and vacant lots to collect pop bottles from, pop bottles that could be turned into cash.
 I lived in Raleigh till  2nd grade.

 Harruq rose, glanced at the body, and then departed.

Perhaps one day you will become a grandparent.
 During all of these periods your experiences and certain moments mold you into who you will be.
 It isn’t easy to forget the dark places in your past but you can either learn from them and become a better person or repeat the same behavior and have it slowly destroy you.
 I make many mistakes as a father, but I have always tried the best I know how.
 Sometimes no matter what a person does as a parent, children may travel to dangerous places.
 Some will return from those places unharmed and some may never return.
 A family can look perfect from the outside but be quite the opposite on the inside.
 I have lived such a life.
 I do not know what made me do what I did for my son but I can only surmise that it was a combination of all of the defining moments in my life that lead me to where I am today.

 "What about Father?"
 "I met him two years after I lost Andrew.

 And he gave me you and John, so I'd certainly never regret having married him."

 “Did you practice the spells I taught you?” Velixar asked as Qurrah took his seat by the fire.
 “Yes,” Qurrah said.
 “I am more than pleased with them.”
 “You will need to keep a fresh supply of bones with you,” Velixar said, reaching into his pouch.
 “Take these for now until you can obtain more.”
 Qurrah accepted the bones, stashing them into a small pocket he had sewn onto his robe.

“You foolish mortal,” Velixar said.
 His voice was far deeper than before, less like a man and more like a demon.
 “I do not fear your steel.”
 Pale hands shot upward, hooked in strange formations.
 Dieredon stabbed a long blade straight at the man’s throat.
 The blade halted halfway there, crashing against an invisible barrier.
 The elf struck again, this time lower.
 Velixar’s image rippled as if beneath water, his body protected by some unseen wall.
 Faster and faster Dieredon swung, whirling his blades against where he perceived the wall to be.
 Power rippled in the air, black and deadly.

 I confess to finding myself more sympathetic with Luke than with the patriarch Abraham.
 Soren Kierkegaard calls Abraham the Knight of Faith, a fellow so sure of God that even the idea of questioning a command to murder his own son was unthinkable.
 Good for him.
 Honest.
 Luke the horse breeder, I can admire, and Eric I can adore, in part because I know their flaws, their humanity.
 Luke's are exposed in "A Father's Story".
 Eric's I can remember, and for reminders, I have his report cards.
 Adoring a human may require us to have developed beyond pure selfishness.
 Yet once that's accomplished, the task seems to come naturally.

 Junnie.
 She stared back at me for one brief moment before she turned to fight some invisible foe.
 The stunned moment took the last of the borrowed courage from me, and I drew in, afraid, as my body remained encaged in vine and thorns.
 My legs were wet with blood, arms deadened to the pain and cold.
 I became aware of an unbroken chant, a voice I didn’t recognize, and I turned, stunned again, as I saw Asher.
 He wasn’t in the battle.
 He stood back, seemingly a bystander as the words flowed from his barely moving lips.

May we know the guidance of your twin children, Honor and Justice.” He then knelt down and pulled one of the two short swords from his weapon harness; he crossed his arms and laid the blade across his own upper arms.
 It was possible, only with great concentration to do this without dropping the sword or cutting himself.
 His instructor had taught the squires this simple prayer.
 It guaranteed that the squires stayed focused during meditation.
 Doi’van and Imeralda looked at him as he knelt in the grass with the sword naked on his bare arms.
 Rodregas spoke carefully so as not to tip the sword and said, “It is called sword meditation.
 My instructor would start us out with the prayer and then we would meditative on our duty.” “For how long?” asked Imeralda.
 “Until you are sure of what your duty is,” Rodregas replied, hearing the voice of his old drill Knight Captain.
 All the instructors had been retired knights who enjoyed teaching the squires.
 He did not think the two would join him for this but both pulled their weapons and imitated his position, Doi’van with his large great sword balanced on his powerful arms, Imeralda grabbed her bow instead of a short sword, which with her lack of training was probably a good idea.

When he finally dared a loud, gasping breath of air, the pain was not so bad.
 Qurrah stood, picked up his whip, and then went to help his brother.
 He expected to see his body dead in the street, for why else had he still not returned?
 He held hope that Harruq still fought against his enemies, or that more had come beyond the three the elf had claimed.
 What he was not prepared for was the sight of Harruq hunched over the dying body of Aurelia Thyne.
 “Harruq,” he tried to call out.
 The flesh in the back of his throat tore.
 Blood poured down his throat, slick and hot.
 Qurrah cursed.
 Such a wound would kill him if he did not seek help.

 An elderly man and woman, propping each other up as they ran side by side, refused to turn when Harruq barreled toward them.
 Salvation took the woman’s life, Condemnation the man’s.
 The two bodies collapsed, their lifeless limbs entangled.
 Not far ahead of them, a woman ran in only her shift, a child clutched to her breast.
 “Why do you flee?” Harruq roared when her crying eyes glanced back at him.

 My throat was too raw to speak, so Chevelle gave me a canteen.

 “What happened?” I finally choked out, but they were tight-lipped.
 “How do you feel?” Chevelle asked.
 His tone was off, a little shaky.
 I couldn’t tell if he was cross or something else.
 There was something so familiar about him, the way he leaned over me, but my thoughts weren’t working right yet.
 I tried to clear my head before answering.
 “I don’t know.” It was the best I could do.

 “Great!” I piped.
 “I’ll call home quickly to check with my parents.” I called home and my parents said I could go, which wasn’t much of a surprise.
 I’ve been to plenty of sleepovers at Emily’s, so my parents didn’t mind.
 Plus, our parents were close and Emily’s family was practically an extension of our own.

 Rodregas was caught up in the commanding presence of the man.
 “To the Order and to the Celestials!” his voice was half command and half prayer.
 Everyone including combatants and those watching from wall and window responded, so that the words swirled around the arena.
 “To the Order and to the Celestials!” This time the Grand Marshal seemed to look around at all the spectators until finally he nodded, satisfied.
 Without another word he strode out.
 Imeralda followed him as did all the squire’s attendants.
 It was time for the final match.
 Rodregas left his shield and mace relaxed at his side and strode over to Nordien, who stood with shield and mace at the ready.
 Instead of attacking he asked the big man, “So, are people right, do you plan to serve the Immortalists if you gain the greater sigil?” The squire looked around a little confused.

 His hand reached out, the tips of his fingers brushing the sides of the man’s face.

 "Please don't say you don't love me."
 He cupped her jaw, stroking her cheek with his thumb.
 "I know that you have to sort things out now that you've decided not to marry your boyfriend.
 But please give me a chance."
 He slid both arms around her, gathering her close as his mouth covered hers.
 His kiss was almost irresistible, but she was hurting too much to stay in his arms.

 He turned to her, reading trust and honesty in her eyes.
 Without a word he slid his arms around her, burying his face in her neck as he hugged her.
 She coaxed him into the water, where they swam and floated on gentle waves.

I couldn't help trying to catch another glimpse of the art class as I walked past.
 I'd been hoping to see Alec again, but hadn't expected him to look up as I craned my neck to see inside.
 I stumbled a little in surprise.
 He was still gorgeous, but the simple joy was gone.
 He no longer looked like something that couldn't exist in this world, but even with anger etched on his features my heart still skipped a beat.
 I ducked around the corner and started down the stairs, my embarrassment at being caught staring giving way to anger.
 It didn't make any sense.
 I'd never done anything to him.
 Did he really hate me so much just because I'd told him off about not protecting Rachel?
 Cassie was waiting for me at my locker when I got there.

When she'd finished, Marie pointed to an overhead panel and asked Rick, "Is this where the oxygen masks fall from?"
 "I think so."
 "Haven't you ever put one on?"
 "No.
 Traveling by plane is really safe, sweetheart.
 Far fewer people are killed in plane crashes than in car crashes."
 She sat back when she felt the airplane pick up speed.
 She was looking out the window, so she both saw and felt the plane leave the ground.
 "We're in the air!"
 she gasped.

"Rachel, you should be wearing your seatbelt."
 "Why?
 It isn't like anyone is going to pull us over and give us a ticket."
 It was more difficult than I expected to formulate a coherent answer while fighting off the first quivering indications of another attack.
 "She's right, Rachel.
 You should be buckled in."
 I expected her to argue with him.
 No girl on the planet liked it when her older brother sided with her friends against her, but Rachel just frowned a little before scooting back so she could do up her seatbelt.
 Was she really that scared of him?
 I stole a glance at him out of the corner of my eye.

 She caught her mother's look and smiled.
 "Yes, I really am still a virgin.
 But I'll admit--to you and to no one else, Mother--that that's just because Rick is a gentleman.
 And because he always put what was best for me before what he wanted.
 We would kiss and kiss and kiss, and then he'd stop and tell me we had to stop, or we'd end up making love.

Sure, teaching nine classes and raising kids is hard, but it’s not going to kill you.
 What will kill you is not writing.” The next morning, I got up at 5 a.m. instead of 5:30, which allowed me to write for a half hour.
 Not much, but enough to give me hope, which is the antidote to despair.
 The stuff I wrote during those half-hour sessions became crucial parts of my novel The Loud Adios.
 About a month after the semester ended, I sent the manuscript to a national contest.
 I won.
 But success isn't the point.
 The point is, when we're stumped, or stuck, and we ask God, if an answer comes, we had better heed it.
 Okay, I think.
 I will write about reading Brother Lawrence and this trip before the next novel or anything else gets in my way.

 Well anyways go ahead and pray, I doubt that it will do much good, but whatever, have fun with praying for my soul and so forth.

Not to his surprise, it was Geriodon who was the first to face him and fend him off.
 Rodregas almost ran face into the squire’s mace, only throwing himself down barely in time to miss the blow.
 Rodregas knew that if this was going to work he had to keep up the momentum.
 He spun around and started to run around his opponent, circle him at a breakneck speed.
 Geriodon responded perfectly.
 He kept one foot planted and spun tight to help counter Rodregas’ speed.
 It should have worked.
 And it did work for several minutes.
 Rodregas simply kept running in a circle around Geriodon just outside the range of his mace.
 He dug into the sand with his feet and he ran, and kept running.

I tried to shake the feeling during History, but was still fighting it when I walked into Physics.
 In a departure from his normal routine, Alec was already seated when I arrived.
 I flipped open my notebook and tried to distract myself with a brief sketch, only to tear the page out and ball it up as the bell rang.
 I looked up to see Alec staring at me, which just made me mad.
 It was completely unfair.
 I wasn't going to get to go to Les Misérables, but he was rich enough to fly to New York and book the whole theater.
 As Mrs. Alexander stood up to take roll, a burst of static silenced us all.
 "It's my pleasure to read off the names of the five winners in our drawing for tickets to Les Misérables."
 "The first winner is Pam White."
 Somewhere down the hall I heard someone yell, and then an entire class broke out into cheers.

Of course it was possible he'd forgotten to make the arrangements, but somehow I doubted it.
 Mom looked like she was starting to waver.
 "It does seem like a great opportunity, but there just isn't any good way to know for sure it's legitimate."
 That didn't sound like Alec at all.
 "Are you sure, Mom?
 They didn't arrange anything you could use to verify they're for real?"
 I suddenly realized why parents got such a big kick out of catching their kids doing something wrong.
 Mom looked so sheepish I almost laughed.
 "Well, he did say he'd arrange for an immediate advance to be wired over to our bank, but it's closed on Saturdays, and it isn't like I can go calling up the bank president for something trivial like that."
 I opened my mouth, still unsure what to say in response to her latest excuse, only to be interrupted by her cell phone again.

 "I'd love it!"
 She almost choked on her Slurpee, the first she'd ever had.
 "Where can I drive to?"
 "From one end of the parking lot to the other."
 "A parking lot?"
 "I'll take you to a big, empty parking lot somewhere and let you get the feel of it.
 When you feel comfortable, I might let you drive around some quiet neighborhoods, but you need to study the rules of the road so you can get a license.
 Then we'll see about trying out the streets downtown and the highways."

“Yesterday… the council trackers…” Trackers?
 I tried to focus on what he was saying and not let my mind run wild with the new information.
 “They will send someone for what I have done.” I thought of the councilman’s face, distorted in pain.
 “We should continue your training.” “Training?” Even I could hear the dread in my question.
 “Practice.
 You should be able to protect yourself.” I remembered his words from before the revelation that ended my magic lessons.
 Fighters.
 A chill ran down my spine as I nodded my assent.
 I’d skinned out of a few run-ins with council and it was no secret how they operated.
 I might be safe enough with Chevelle, but if the others retrieved me… “We will work again at first light and possibly as we ride.” Part of me wanted to argue, As we ride?

 Marie knew that the stern look her father gave John was intended to mask the love and pride he felt.
 Her own heart tightened with love.

It ached.
 I didn’t want him to hate me.
 Ruby whirled into the room and grabbed me around the waist from behind, spinning me up, over the back of the seat, and through her door before I could process what was happening.
 She plopped me down in the center of her bed and swung around to sit in front of me.
 My head was reeling from the spin as she smiled at me, waving her hands and bringing a plethora of bottles and canisters flying toward us to drop on the bed.
 I thought with disappointment that I hadn’t responded to her attack as Chevelle had taught me and laughed at the image in my head.
 Ruby gave me a genuine smile as she began twisting the lid on a small metal canister.
 “No mother to teach us the tricks of the trade,” she sighed as she leaned in.
 I jerked away from her, wanting to be angry about the comment.
 But Ruby had just told me her own story, no less tragic.

Chapter Fourteen Traveling
 The group was waiting for us when we crossed over the ridge, down to the site where we had spent so many days and nights.
 If I hadn’t been so exhausted from lack of sleep, I would have probably been nervous.
 As it was, I blindly followed Ruby as we gathered and eventually mounted to leave.
 Chevelle, Steed, and I were back on our mounts from the earlier leg of the journey.
 Ruby, Grey, and Anvil each rode their own black horses, though Anvil’s was larger—I assumed to accommodate his massive frame—and Ruby’s was decorated, tendrils of red and gold in his mane.
 Though it wasn’t unusual, I didn’t see Rhys and Rider or the wolves.
 I wondered if they had their own horses and preferred to stay out of sight or if they ran with the wolves.
 I felt slightly comforted either way.
 Once we were on our way, I didn’t mind so much.

 She was finally home.

 Aurelia eyed him, obviously insulted.
 She gave him two quick raps across the chest.

 Harruq raised his swords and roared.
 He crossed the distance between them in a heartbeat, twice as fast as he had ever moved in their previous sparring matches.
 Aurelia leapt backward as blades dove for her chest and abdomen.
 Her staff shot spun back and forth to parry thrust after thrust.

It continued on—her father’s rigorous schedule, their distaste for her sister—and then the entries got more detailed and frequent.
 Mother has been too ill lately for guests.
 I have not been able to see her.
 The tedium of my duties is getting to me and Father has been relentless with my studies, pushing me harder and harder to strengthen my control.
 My sister has been exploring the mountains.
 I see her bring in all sorts of interesting finds, but she refuses to tell me where she got them.
 I wish there were a way to sneak out.
 I would follow her or force her to show me, but Father is keeping a close eye on me, making certain I stick to a strict schedule.
 This morning he brought in a detailed list for Rune, giving him direction through a series of tasks.

She handed Rodregas one and then waited for Doi’van to follow her instructions.
 Then, warning him to be ready, she dropped down one of the fruits which he caught with his normal grace.
 “Stay on the root,” she warned him.
 “You cannot take one of the blessings off the tree; it will wither and die if you try.” She winked at Rodregas as she said this.
 Imeralda then proceeded to eat the acorn shaped fruit; it took some work.
 It seemed to be a bit harder than any ripe fruit Rodregas knew of, but he followed her example and found that while it was tart it was amazing.
 It tasted of... Rodregas did not know what to call the flavor; the words that came to mind were sunlight and rain and the smell of a forest at night.
 When Rodregas finished the fruit completely he felt more whole but was also sad that it was gone.
 Imeralda seemed in great humor.
 “Come on,” she said.

You have broken some of your bonds.

 He stood and started toward me, about to speak again—just as the door swung open.
 Chevelle’s face flushed with anger.
 “Elfreda!” Steed was through the door and to me in three long strides.
 He grabbed me at the waist, picking me up and spinning me so that my cloak swirled behind.
 The shock and exuberance of his greeting was too much and I couldn’t help but let out a breathless laugh.
 He put me down but kept me close, his hands still at my waist.
 “Steed,” I said, very nearly winded.
 “What are you doing here?” He glanced at Chevelle, who was still plainly annoyed, and his carefree smile dissolved.

Rodregas managed to get in close and, abandoning his useless short sword, grabbed his opponent’s shield and pulled him in.
 The guard tried to shrug him off, his bearded face looked afraid.
 His eyes, a light blue, stared at Rodregas with revulsion.
 He was probably wondering how Rodregas could be strong enough to take on an Immortal Guard.
 Rodregas knew from the guard’s fear that he had him, he was not thinking clearly.
 Rodregas growled at him, letting him feel his anger and rage at taking slaves to be used by the Immortalists.
 Rodregas had seen what would happen to them.
 He had suffered for years with a subtle kind of inner rot at letting the evil continue.
 In all the ways that mattered Rodregas knew he was no better than this man, he had spent most of his life as a slaver.
 Rodregas had no moral grounds on which to kill these men, but inside of him there was no mercy.

 Flying overhead, Dieredon watched the beginning of the battle with a sickness in his stomach.
 The man in black had come.
 He watched the arrows bounce off the magical shield, and then watched the human army charge and overwhelm the small elven force that had come to face them.
 “I will keep my word, Antonil,” he said.
 “Fly back to the others, Sonowin, we will battle this day.” The horse snorted, making Dieredon laugh.
 “No, I am sure you won’t be hurt.” Sonowin banked, giving the elf one last view of the battle before soaring east to where the rest of the Quellan elves waited atop their magnificent pegasi.

I sighed, wondering why those two buffoons had been granted this power along, with Emily and me.
 It’s not like they weren’t foolish enough already.
 The day when it all changed was still a mystery to us.
 A lot of things happened that didn’t quite make sense.
 The four of us were already best friends.
 We were walking through the woods, rambling on about how Halloween was almost here and that Ms. Stecher was still giving us too much homework.
 Then all of a sudden an invisible object slammed into me.
 I shrieked and couldn’t move.
 It had me pinned to the ground.

I normally would have complained--I'd become much more sensitive about speeding in the last couple of months, but I was anxious to get home, and very much not feeling like there was anything particularly special to live for.
 Not that I was suicidal, contrary to Mom's unvoiced, but obvious fears.
 I just didn't have much of anything to look forward to.
 It wasn't until Britney's Saturn was nearly out of sight that I realized our Jeep Cherokee was parked in the driveway.
 I sometimes felt I should have outgrown the need to talk to Mom when things were tough, but I couldn't deny that it felt like a big weight had been lifted off me as I walked through the door.
 "I'm home, Mom.
 How did your latest shoot..." Whatever I'd been about to say evaporated off of my tongue as I entered the living room and saw Mom curled up on the couch with bloodshot eyes.
 Mom had always been the strong one.
 I still more or less belonged in some kind of padded room.
 Mom had simply accepted events and done her best to hold our life together so there'd be something for me to come back to.

I’ve seen the great falls frozen; I’ve seen it turned off as if there were a giant tap.
 I’ve stood on a rocking boat deck beneath its monstrous incontestableness.
 Where I was born is a grey little town, a pustule on the side of grey little Niagara New York.
 The Canadian side had the greener grass, we all knew, even as late at night, in our trundle beds, we felt the thrum in our veins of a power larger than kings, a warbling of just what the earth has in mind, though it stayed, of course, just beyond us.
 I longed to be from the Canadian side; I longed to be Canadian.
 I thought my mother's family was just about the most exotic thing I could imagine (and later in school I used her heritage as if it were some bizarre ethnic upbringing, as if one side of my family tree was hung with Hottentots, or Eskimos), and my Canuck uncles, who were all big, strapping, lumberjack men, who could hold seven or eight nieces and nephews on their backs, were the ideal of manhood with which I constantly compared my scrawny, allergic, weak wristed self (No upper body strength, my tennis coach would later tell me).
 Actually I have few memories from Lewiston.
 We left there when I was four, to Memphis, Tennessee..  What memories I do possess are clouded as if suspended in aspic, dream recollections, impressionistic and shadowy.
 I remember Cyrano.

"Are you okay?
 I'm sorry about that, I was afraid you were going to hurt yourself."
 Alec's even tones caressed me like a calming breeze.
 I finally oriented myself enough to realize that the warm, solid surface my back was resting against wasn't a wall.
 "I'm sorry.
 It was a nightmare."
 My voice came out raw and scratchy, like I'd been talking for hours, or possibly just screaming for the last minute or so.
 I wanted to tell him about what had happened, but now that I was awake my fears felt foolish.
 I tried to distract myself by looking around, and then felt my face heat up as I realized I'd fallen asleep in Alec's room.

The ban on use should be followed by urgent measures to dismantle and scrap this entire class of weapons worldwide.
 9.Highest priority must be given to controlling and reversing the proliferation of small arms in line with the determined international measures employed to curb hijacking.
 As an immediate first step, these weapons should be classified and a UN register created to monitor their manufacture and sale.
 Agreements should be negotiated between major arms suppliers to severely restrict production and sales.
 Strong sanctions must be instituted to discourage states from actively or passively abetting small arms proliferation, especially to non-state actors.
 10.UN action to curb the international trade in major armaments needs to go further than the existing Arms Register.
 Arms exports to areas identified by the UN as trouble spots should be banned by international law.
 An independent agency should be established to verify the submissions from arms-exporting states.
 Major arms exporters should agree to consult the Security Council in advance about large orders received for destabilizing weapons and, where appropriate, coordinate actions to limit the size of arms transfers.
 11.Narcotic drug production and trafficking must be treated as threats to international peace and security.

As I sit and gaze toward the Mexican border, I think of Eric, and how we used to peer through twilight and try to locate his home in the valley about five miles closer to Mexico.
 Which reminds me of Sylvia and how the cruelty of the world drove her crazy, and I wonder if turning to Jesus might have cured her, if she had let him expel her bitterness.
 Because for those who fail to discover peace and even joy in the midst of the cruelty, going mad is only sensible.
 I imagine Eric sitting beside me, wearing the same face as after he pinned me to his living room floor, just before he coached me to believe in myself no matter the evidence that I was a loser.
 Then the expression changes to the one I imagine him wearing when he told Kenny they needed to leave for the desert without Billy and me.
 I get a crazy idea I have never considered before.
 Because Eric and Olga would have loved each other, I bring Olga out of the air and onto the lounge chair beside Eric.
 I give her the face of her last whole day, while she reclined on the couch in the office we were using as a church.
 After some weeks of hideous pain and frustration that prayers weren’t healing her cancer, that morning she watched us with a deep serenity and graced us with outrageous love.
 Now that I’ve coached myself to talk to Jesus in Eric and Jesus in Olga, and God in Jesus, not only does it no longer feel neurotic or blasphemous.

It was a dragon.
 Chapter 8
 I stood, frozen in fear at the sight of the dragon.
 It stalked towards me.
 The piercing green eyes bore into mine and I was more scared than I had ever been in all 15 years of my life.
 “Jazell move!” Seth yelled and pushed me behind him so hard, I almost fell over.
 I caught myself and pulled out my bow, notching an arrow.
 We all tensed, prepared for a fight.
 All of a sudden, Emily walked towards the dragon.
 Seth yelled at her to get back but she ignored him.

The winner of these tests was rewarded with having his soul and mind ripped out and made into a piece of meat to be filled with the mind, personality, and the very soul of Ravenhurr himself.
 However, this time, instead of Ravenhurr, his old guard sergeant had ended up as a new powerful Immortalist.
 As the cold of the stone chilled his back Rodregas thought about his promise to the Celestial Gods that if he were able to kill Ravenhurr and live, then his new duty would be to fight the Immortalists.
 When all and everyone else had failed him over the years, only his duty had kept Rodregas alive.
 He no longer knew what to do without it.
 His back straightened and he pulled away from the wall that he had slumped against.
 Rodregas lived instead of the man whose body he now lived in.
 He had seen the tragedy of gifted person after gifted person be torn asunder by the Immortalists.
 He hated the Immortalists for their casual destruction and use of people.
 Could he now live in one of these stolen bodies, unless he had a reason?

This necessitates, not only a change from one economic system to another, but also a restructuring of the entire economy from a defence orientation to a consumer orientation.
 This change in structure could not be brought about by reliance on macro-economic policy.
 2.Political and social consensus is essential for rapid social change: In a democratic society, the market cannot be instituted by decrees or authoritarian methods which belong to the old sys tem.
 In the new political climate, reforms will be successful only in the measure that they are understood and accepted by the population.
 The vitality of the market depends on releasing the initiative of people to act in their own perceived best interests by producing and distributing goods and services for consumption by others.
 This initiative cannot be ordered, it can only be encouraged.
 Economic policy recommendations failed adequately to anticipate either the impact of the programme on the people or their reaction to it.
 In the early stages of reform, the public exhibited an incredible degree of patience, tolerance and endurance under conditions of growing hardship.
 Gradually public resentment and personal suffering (especially for the aged, children and new entrants to the work force) became so severe in some countries that no government could have sustained the programme without facing political upheaval or violent revolution.
 There is some truth in the argument that ‘shock therapy’ did not fail in Russia and other countries, because it was never actually implemented.

Only I could count the number of hikes I'd actually participated in on one hand.
 Surely something like that would've stayed with me.
 Someone gasped as the crowd shifted around, distracting me from my half-formed suspicions.
 I looked over at the exterior wall of the school and felt my jaw drop.
 Maybe Mom had read the story about the three little pigs a few too many times to me when I was growing up, but I'd always thought of brick as the strongest possible building material.
 I didn't have any idea if it really was, but it seemed incredible that anything could've wreaked such damage.
 The bricks on the wall next to the door were cracked and set back in the wall, almost like they'd been hit with some kind of wrecking ball, and the concrete of the sidewalk had gouges crisscrossing its surface like some kind of abstract painting.
 "There's nothing to see here, kids.
 I want you to all disperse and go to your home rooms."
 The short, mostly bald man who'd ordered us all to leave was just visible through a gap in the crowd.

Lying in the grass next to Velixar was the dead body of an elf male.
 Qurrah glanced at it, and then looked to his master.
 “Do you need help bringing him back to life?” he asked.

 Both of you must rest.

During the past 12 years alone, per capita food production in developing countries has risen by 15 per cent.
 Overall, the proportion of people in developing countries suffering from hunger and mal nutrition has dropped dramatically both in relative and absolute terms, from 941 million people constituting 36 per cent of the population of these nations in 1970 to 781 million constituting less than 20 per cent of the population in 1990.
 Current projections indicate that the growth rate in world agricultural output will continue to exceed population growth over the next two decades.
 By 2010, food grain production is expected to reach four times the level in 1960.
 Increased production of other food crops is expected to raise per capita availability in the developing world to 2700 calories per day.
 Per capita meat production is expected to grow by 60 per cent and milk production by 20 per cent.
 During the same period, malnutrition is projected to decline to 640 million persons, constituting 11.6 per cent of the population of developing countries, a little over half the level in 1990.
 Yet the achievements have not been uniform throughout the developing world.
 Per capita food production has actually declined in more than half of all developing countries over the past 15 years.
 In 18 countries with high rates of population growth, primarily in Africa, it has been deteriorating for the past three decades.

His attackers seemed confused, grabbing him and trying to counter his change of position.
 Rodregas only had one leg under him, but he pushed off with it with all his strength and thrust himself up.
 It should have failed with all the men holding him down, but he now had celestial strength, and even with the knife wound he was strong.
 His attackers backed off, confused by the fact that he had gone from being their prisoner to suddenly rising.
 The person pinning Rodregas’ left arm got too far away.
 This gave Rodregas the leverage he needed to pull the arm free.
 He punched his assailant hard in the face.
 The attacker flew back and Rodregas jumped sideways to get more space.
 Rodregas rested his right hand on the knife blade still sticking out of his stomach.
 He was relieved to feel that it was not too deep.

The adoption of new technologies even in traditional occupations has resulted in a growing demand for higher skill levels in these fields as well.
 Unemployment is highest among the least educated, least skilled categories, such as machine operators, fabricators and labourers.
 The poor are poor both because they have no assets and because their time and labour have low or no economic value.
 Poverty persists wherever the human resource is under-valued.
 To eradicate it, there is need for a paradigm shift from unskilled to skilled work.
 While educated unemployment is high in many developing countries, in most cases the quality and relevance of the education to employment opportunities is far from adequate.
 Here too, fully qualified technical and professional workers are in short supply.
 There is even a shortage for educated workers with a high level of general language and communication skills to fill the job opportunities being created for business process outsourcing.
 On an average, 50 per cent of firms surveyed in a cross-section of developing countries report that skill shortages are a serious constraint on their growth.
 Firms that adopt new technologies report even more serious problems.

Gaining such sigils was outlawed by the guide except for their own warriors, but the Order of the Soaring Heavens was also the traditional sources for the Gods own Paladins, and even the Celestial Guild had never dared to anger the gods by interfering with their use of sigils.
 Rigoria had been one of the greatest of the Order of the Soaring Heavens, but he had grown old and his health had failed him.
 When tempted by the Immortalists with a new body, he had accepted.
 Even though such action was anathema to the very teachings of the Order, he had become an officer of the Immortal Guards, and eventually their leader.
 Several of the most powerful Knights had over the centuries, formed the officer core of The Immortal Guards.
 These Knights traded their honor for near immortality in the Guards.
 The Immortal Guards were all sigil warriors with one or several magical enhancements.
 They also had the best resources of the entire Eastern Realm, the most powerful enchanted armor, the best weapons; their officers rode Dire Beasts for steeds.
 Taking on a sigil warrior would be a huge challenge for Rodregas, or at least he thought it would be.
 He was still unclear of how strong and fast he was.

If I was wrong, Mom was not only home, judging by the noises filtering down the stairs, she was awake and only a few minutes away from coming downstairs.
 Even filled with the near certainty that Brandon's parents, and by extension him, were our secret benefactors, the next fifteen minutes were some of the longest in my life.
 When Brandon's Mustang finally appeared around the bend in the lane, I found myself smiling so hard my face was starting to hurt.
 Breathing silent but heartfelt thanks that Mom was in the shower and therefore couldn't hear the low rumble of the Mustang's engine, I slipped out the front door and skipped down the concrete steps.
 "I figured you were either too sick to get out of bed, or you finally decided to trust me."
 Brandon's gray eyes twinkled as he made a show of checking me over.
 "Looks like you're not sick."
 I didn't know it was possible to blush and smile at the same time.
 "Nope, not sick."
 After such a beginning, my day could hardly be anything but great.

“I think I need to change shields,” he said.
 Doi’van glanced at what remained of Rodregas’ shield and simply nodded and handed him one of their other shields.
 It was not in great shape, but it was whole.
 Rodregas watched a few of the other matches before it was his turn again.
 Except for him, everyone remaining wore full plate.
 Rodregas’ next opponent was shining in the sun in his steel; which was better than him having to face Night Bronze plate, but still not very reassuring.
 The flag fell and Rodregas dug his heals into Doom Hoof’s side and the mount plodded forward.
 His opponent’s horse looked almost as powerful, but much faster.
 The collision happened before Rodregas was fully expecting it and he felt himself hit the ground and hit it hard.
 “Great,” Rodregas muttered to himself, “He has a Dire Steed and full plate armor.” Rodregas rolled over and pushed himself up, Doom Hoof stood nosing the sand looking for food.

 "What else is a girl to do?"
 Alec's reply shrug mirrored mine exactly and yet still turned the movement into something far more graceful and eloquent than what I'd managed.

He searched through the captain’s pair of trunks and found some clothes that fit him, though tightly.
 The captain had been a big man but not as large as Rodregas now was.
 Still the soft linen shirt of light brown, which he knew had been loose on the captain, was much more comfortable than the wizard robe he had been wearing.
 Unfortunately none of the pants would fit.
 Poir, though a large man, had skinny legs.
 Rodregas felt ridiculous wearing only a linen shirt and his coin purses as he stepped to the armory door.
 The door was built of massive slabs of iron oak.
 Rodregas reached up and pulled the emergency key from the crack at the right of the door.
 Due to his status as a senior sergeant, he knew where the key was kept.
 Once the door was open, he stepped inside.

 Jordaan looked surprised, but then nodded.
 “It is a law set forth by both the Celestials and the Infernals.
 Do you know the source of Magic?” he asked her.
 Imeralda nodded, “Sure, there are four sources of magic: mortal, Celestial, Infernal and elemental.
 It is one of the reasons I am prized for my potential with more than one power.
 My AElven ancestry is strong with mortal magic, but my Nymph side is strong in elemental magic.
 If an Immortalist takes my power, he or she could become stronger in both.” “Mostly correct,” Jordaan said.

 He stumbled to the ground.
 His face and armor were camouflaged with greens and browns, but just grass would make it difficult to go unnoticed.

 Certain police or crime television shows would give us lumps in our throats as we would silently look at each other and know we were thinking the same thing… that might be our son.
 One afternoon while I was at work, Lisa was trying to help Brandon out by organizing some of his bills.
 Brandon told her that he needed to run a quick errand.
 She called me later that day and said she had lost track of him and he wasn’t returning her calls or answering his phone.
 All the usual horrible thoughts began to surface in our minds.
 The day turned into night and we still hadn’t heard from him.
 Close to midnight, as Lisa and I watched a movie together in the dark, there was a loud banging at our back sliding glass door.

 “Surround the town,” he commanded them.
 The nearest nodded, the movement swinging the entirety of his rotting face.

 “Send on their souls,” he said, “but leave the bodies for me.”

Five years of research and discussion have created a much greater commonality of perspective, but there are still significant differences among members regarding specific views and recommendations presented in this report.
 However, all the Commissioners agree with the basic emphasis on social and gender equity, job-led growth and human security.
 Members share the conviction that a candid and challenging discussion of these issues is more valuable than representation of a consensus view.
 The Next Millennium
 We are on the threshold of a new millennium.
 All civilizations have recognized the special significance of new beginnings – the dawn of a new day, a new year, a new century.
 These are moments of new birth when fresh vision and greater energy are available for setting out in a new direction or accelerating progress along our chosen course.
 The dawn of a new millennium brings with it a tremendous power for renewal and advancement.
 It can mark a decisive transition or staging ground for speeding humanity’s evolutionary progression.
 The remarkable events of the past few years – the fall of the Berlin Wall, the turn to democracy in the former USSR and other countries of Eastern Europe, the peaceful end of apartheid in South Africa, and concrete steps toward lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians – confirm this truth.

Emily, tell us what to do.” “Alright, boss,” she said sarcastically.
 “Everyone come over.” We walked over to her and the dragon with Seth leaning on Jason.
 The dragon was lying on the ground, watching us closely.
 Its long, leathery wings were tucked neatly on each of its sides.
 It snorted as Emily climbed onto its back.
 I stared at her, starting to think she was a little crazy.
 “Come on!” she said and patted the dragon's back.
 “Do you think that you're too heavy?
 Well, you aren't, so get on his back.” I walked over and climbed onto the dragon's back.
 Jason half hauled Seth on the dragon's back, and Seth almost fell on me.

“Kojas sounds like toe jazz, whatever that is.” I heard Emily laugh and Jason say, “Burn!” Kojas’ eyes flamed but he formed a tight smile.
 “Let me inform you, Jazell, that you are outnumbered five to one?” Man, this guy is good.
 “Um, well we…are cooler than you,” I stumbled.
 “Really Jazell?” Emily hissed from behind me.
 I turned my head to her.
 “Well, you come up with something to top that and we’ll see how well you do.” “Nah, I’m good,” she said quickly.
 Kojas laughed again.
 Seriously, was this faery guy crazy or something?
 “You are mistaken,” he said.
 “I am cooler than you because I hold all the cards.” Then he turned to the army and yelled, “Attack!”

 One of the songs on my I-pod, "I Surrender All," has long been a favorite.
 I listen, I sing along, I pray the lyrics, I perform the song accompanied by my guitar.
 But somehow all that surrender doesn't quite work.
 Maybe I'll start praying the words of a poem by Olga Savitsky, a friend who adored God.
 She said so often, and she was honest above all, and she lived as much like Brother Lawrence as anybody I know, or know of, maybe excepting some of Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity.
 Here's Olga's poem: Father, heart-melting Father, I have tried to let go of so many things.

In addition another 500 million workers in the developing world earned less than a dollar a day.
 Although the growth rate of the world's labour force is slowing down, approximately 460 million additional jobseekers will enter the global labour force between 2000 and 2010, two-thirds in Asia.
 ILO has concluded that the prospects for an improving global employment situation depend mainly on continued expansion of the world economy.
 While that expansion is likely, economic growth alone will not be sufficient to provide opportunities for sustainable livelihood for all those who need it.
 Jobs or livelihood for all must be the bottom line of all development, technological and trade policies.
 It will be necessary for governments to elevate employment to the top of their policy agenda and dedicate themselves to the vital task of achieving full employment.
 The Right to Employment
 The Commission’s report called for urgent action to address the problem of rising unemployment and presented a comprehensive set of strategies designed to promote full employment in both developed and developing countries.
 The centre-piece of ICPF’s approach is the assertion that employment must be recognized as a fundamental human right, the economic equivalent of the right to vote.
 As the electoral franchise is the basis for the legitimacy and operation of democracy, access to gainful employment constitutes the economic franchise that lends legitimacy and functionality to a market economy.

Jasmin's backless black dress and shoulder-length gloves had streaks of blue that brought out her eyes, while Dominic's tight, red gown seemed to give her the confidence and poise you'd expect from someone so gorgeous and utterly exotic.
 Jess had opted for a sleeveless silver number that flared out at the bottom so much I wasn't sure how Isaac would be able to walk next to her without stepping on the shimmery material.
 Rachel's mauve dress was probably the most conservative of all, neither over-snug, nor especially low-cut.
 It had seemed entirely out of character considering what she'd purchased for the rest of us, but when I'd asked, she'd just grimaced and said Alec would've made her stay home if she'd chosen anything more daring.
 None of which helped me feel any more comfortable in the tight, strapless wonder Rachel had been so excited to give me.
 Even with all of the weight I'd lost since the accident, it still felt like the material was fighting a losing battle to stretch itself over my frame.
 I'd been hoping to be able to put off actually putting the dress on for at least another half hour, but when my makeup had finally been pronounced satisfactory, Jasmin had studied me for a few minutes, pulled my hair back, secured it with a pair of silver combs I was worried might actually contain genuine diamonds, and then helped Rachel cram me into the dress.
 If Jessica hadn't grudgingly complimented me on just how good my hair looked, I might have suspected Jasmin was trying to purposefully make me look worse than the other girls.
 Dominic and Rachel had to tell me I looked good, that was an unwritten girl-rule regardless of what species you were.
 Jessica had no such imperative, so I was forced to conclude Jasmin had done the best she could considering what she had to work with, and resigned myself to being the homely one in the group.

It was already making my hair flap all over the place.
 I heard Seth huff out and I turned.
 He gave me a face and said, “Your hair keeps getting in my face.” I turned back around.
 “Deal.” We turned in the air and I could see the mountains in the distance.
 They were small but were growing fast as we neared them.
 I could feel the dragon’s muscles pump underneath my legs.
 Small gusts of air rolled off the dragon’s wings that blew Emily’s hair in her face.
 I smiled as she raked the pink strands out of her mouth.
 We dipped down and I felt the “stomach-in-your-chest” feeling you usually get from rollercoasters.
 I closed my eyes and tried to ignore it but I couldn’t.

As I pass the beach camp at San Onofre where Eric and I spent a couple of my happiest weeks, I silence my I-pod and remember.
 Superman
 I was fifteen when, on Christmas night, I lost my dad to a heart attack.
 He left my mom and me alone in our house on a hill a few miles north of Mexico and near enough to the Pacific so that when Santa Ana winds blew the gunk away, we could see ocean and islands.
 My mom was a rock.
 Over the past few years, before losing my dad, she had helped bury her father, a sister, and two brothers.
 She was the one who always fed me, nursed me, brought home a monthly check, and covered the debts my dad’s failed business ventures had accumulated.
 But soon after that dreadful Christmas, she got stricken by headaches and became a hermit.
 Evenings she would withdraw to her room and lie with a cool cloth on her forehead, listening to the Lakers, the Padres, or Dodgers, or to whomever the playoffs featured.
 Even through the World Series, she hardly watched an inning on television.

I forgot what I was looking for when I recognized a face, hooded in a cloak, fighting against her own.
 Junnie.
 She stared back at me for one brief moment before she turned to fight some invisible foe.
 The stunned moment took the last of the borrowed courage from me, and I drew in, afraid, as my body remained encaged in vine and thorns.
 My legs were wet with blood, arms deadened to the pain and cold.
 I became aware of an unbroken chant, a voice I didn’t recognize, and I turned, stunned again, as I saw Asher.
 He wasn’t in the battle.
 He stood back, seemingly a bystander as the words flowed from his barely moving lips.
 Then he ran.
 Confusion again as Junnie followed after him.

"You got a call too?"
 "Yes.
 I'm afraid something has come up.
 Will you be okay here for a few hours?"
 Normal human response was to make a little white lie, but I got the feeling I wouldn't be able to get away with lying to Alec.
 "I rather suspect whatever 'came up' is important enough I'll just have to be okay."
 He flinched a little, like maybe my aim had been a little too true.
 He looked for a moment like he was going to say something, but then his phone started vibrating again, and he simply nodded as he turned and walked away, moving much faster by himself than he did when I was with him.
 As I stared at the empty space where he'd been standing just a second before, I felt my chest start to constrict, and my breathing speed up.
 The sense of terror racing along my synapses was completely irrational, and extraordinarily powerful.

I closed my mouth in astonishment.
 "I didn't realize Alec had talked to anyone about me.
 Actually I think you just let more drop in a few sentences than he's told me all week.
 Alec claims it's because I could be put in danger just by knowing certain things, but I think he's still just not quite sure he can trust me."
 Mallory slowly leaned back in her chair, and then shook her head.
 "No, it isn't because he doesn't trust you.
 If he didn't trust you, he wouldn't have brought you here.
 He'd trust Isaac or Jasmin with his or even Rachel's life, but neither of them know about me.
 In fact, bringing you here expands the circle of people who know about me to a grand total of three.
 He trusts you, more than just trusts you, but he's right.

 Rick propped himself up on an elbow, gazing at her.
 Her eyes were closed, her face still flushed.
 He knew that she wanted him, and he didn't think she'd respond to his touches and kisses the way she always did if she didn't love him.
 He could make her happy if she stayed here with him.

“Stupid elfie,” he said, gingerly touching the arrow in his neck.
 Not knowing what else to do, he closed his hand about the shaft and pulled.
 A minute later, still lying in agonizing pain, the half-orc managed to pry open one of his healing potions.
 He gulped the swirling blue-silver contents and then tossed the vial.
 Ripping the other arrow out of his side, he felt a warm, soothing sensation fill his body.
 “Are you alright?” he heard a raspy voice ask from atop the stairs.
 “Yeah, I’m fine.
 Just had to take care of something here.”
 He trudged down the stairs to where Qurrah waited.

They were dealing with a limited supply of arrows; once the arrows where all shot, they lost their main advantage.
 Rodregas heard the noise of the first soldier to rush from the road; he went low and swung hard.
 Rodregas hit knee high and the man trying to run by went flying head first into the dirt.
 Rodregas knew from the feel of the blow that his sword had hit armor and bounced off.
 It was an Immortal Guard.
 Doi’van shot another arrow almost straight down into the back of the neck of the downed guard.
 The man thrashed once and then laid still.
 The second body flew by in a blur.
 With such swiftness, Rodregas reasoned, he must have a sigil of speed.
 He headed right for Doi’van and was behind Rodregas before he could do anything.

“You will suffer,” he gasped.
 “For ages, I will make you suffer.”
 “Try it,” said Dieredon.
 Two more arrows flew, but they halted in mid-air.
 Velixar stood, his hand outstretched, gripping the projectiles with his mind.
 The elf fired two more volleys but all the arrows froze beside the others.
 “Fool,” Velixar hissed.
 At once, the arrows turned and resumed their flight, straight at Dieredon.
 The elf dove, rolling underneath the barrage.
 Not an arrow had hit earth before the elf tucked his feet and kicked.

 There were more turns than I had any hope of ever remembering, but eventually we made it to a familiar-looking door.
 At a nod from Donovan I pushed it open, and then as the furnishings registered, I turned back around.
 "This is Alec's room.

 "Young Mr. Graves instructed that you were to have every convenience.

He noticed that the Hellborn Doi’van and Imeralda seemed to be hanging back.
 As the three men started to head down the road Doi’van walked up to Rodregas and stated, “I would rather travel with you.” That was it; he just stood there like some huge tree after that simple statement.
 Audrian seemed as surprised as he was.
 They both spoke at the same time, their thoughts strangely in agreement.
 “Are you crazy?” asked Audrian at the same time as Rodregas said, “That is crazy.” “Look, the Guild will be after me,” Rodregas stated.
 “It will not be safe to travel in my company,” he added.
 “I know,” stated the Hellborn in a voice that was so deep it was like stones grinding.
 “But still, I would travel with you.” Again he made the statement and showed no interest in explaining his action.
 “Actually,” added Imeralda shaking her long curly hair behind her as if to clear the way for her decision, “I was thinking the same thing.
 I am not safe from the Guild anyhow.

I tried not to let my voice get too sing-song, but I felt a completely irrational thrill as he quietly crossed over to my side of the room.
 "That's actually one of the benefits of my condition.
 I don't actually need normal amounts of sleep.
 An hour or two per night is usually more than enough."
 Having him so close to me was somehow both exhilarating and soothing at the same time.
 I could feel the tense, knotty parts of me start to relax for the first time since Simon and Nathanial tried to kill me.
 As exhaustion started to finally eat through all of the nervous energy that'd been fueling me, it was all I could do to follow what Alec was saying.
 Still, I wasn't ready to go to sleep.
 It felt like he'd disappear if I closed my eyes.
 "So you don't need to sleep.

 The study was empty.
 I let out a shaky breath and glanced around.
 Nothing was out of place except for a thistle on the table.

We walked in comfortable silence for several minutes before turning off into what I could only assume was the Lilac Room.
 Donovan looked up as we entered the suite.

 He turned towards me, only to break off as a cell phone rang.
 "It's for you, probably your mom.

 “Well,” Seth stated, “maybe we should ask the dwarfs where he is.” “That’ll be hard.” Emily pointed out.
 “They hardly tell us anything as it is.
 You try squeezing out information from one of these pests.” “I did.” “Whatever guys, we’re getting nowhere.
 Hey Emily you want to sleep over tonight?” I asked.
 Emily frowned, “It’s my turn, Jazell, and you’re coming over my house.” “Honestly, Em, just come over…” “No,” she said and crossed her arms stubbornly.
 I sighed and ran a hand through my hair, knowing it was useless to argue with her when her mind was made up.
 “Fine, I’ll call my parents.
 But next time you’re coming to my house.” She nodded, her curls bobbing.
 “Fair enough.” “Okay then, see you two later.” Jason turned around with Seth on his heels.

Incidence of malnutrition among children under five years of age remains severe in both Africa and South Asia.
 But the problem is more complex than these numbers suggest.
 Although India is considered a food surplus state, it is home to the largest number of undernourished people in the world and access to a balanced diet and clean drinking water is far below the basic requirements for sound health.
 Projections indicate that over the next decade growth of the world’s food supply will be adequate to meet the needs of all human beings.
 The UN Millennium Development Goal of halving the number of human beings suffering from hunger and malnutrition between 1990 and 2015 is highly commendable, yet achieving it would still leave an unconscionably large number of people without adequate food.
 More can and must be done in the next decade to eradicate the scourge of hunger.
 The problem of water scarcity is even more pervasive and challenging.
 Studies indicate that by 2015 more than half the world’s population – mostly in Africa, the Middle East, South Asia and Northern China – will be living in countries that are ‘water-stressed’.
 In the developing world, more than 80 per cent of the water is utilized for agriculture, an unsustainable level that is depleting water tables, increasing soil salinity and accelerating erosion.
 Although historically water has often been a source of contention between communities, it has never been the cause of an open inter-state conflict.

She leaned over to feel his forehead.
 "Hmmm.
 You may have a slight fever.
 I'm going to get you some aspirin and juice."
 He watched her go.
 She was so sweet and loving.
 When she returned, he took the aspirin and drank the juice, obeying when she insisted that he lie down on the sofa so that she could bathe his face with cool water.
 Marie patted his forehead with the washcloth, dipped it into the bowl of water, wrung it out, and then patted his forehead again.

I stood, easing my clothes off, soiled and tattered from the days of batterings.
 The damage on my bare skin was minimal.
 I had imagined much worse as I’d failed to block so many of the strikes.
 I satisfied my ego by giving the cat pee-smelling elixir more credit than was probably due, but some part of me knew the training had not been hard because it was physical.
 It had been the use of magic.
 I put the new shirt on, made of soft black leather and corseted tight around my waist.
 Slim, dark wool pants and tall boots went on next and I wondered at the village we’d be entering where black was appropriate.
 I could think of no one at home who had worn black; I envisioned the dainty blond elves dancing around in dark leather and giggled.
 I glanced up to find Chevelle, wearing an unfathomable expression.
 I hurried to finish lacing the boots, throwing the cloak around my shoulders as he left more rations and went to ready the horses.

I opened my mouth to protest, and then the expression on her face finally registered for me.
 Compassion.
 Acceptance of the viewer, combined with an obvious desire to mend grievous hurts.

 There was the gratitude.
 Misplaced on her perfect face.

 And grow hot as she remembered.
 Rick's kisses were unlike anything she'd ever imagined.
 She could have spent her whole life watching romances and still never have been able to dream of anything as exciting as Rick's kisses and touches.
 Rubbing her cheek against his shirt, she whispered, "Rick?"
 "Yeah?"
 "Can I tell you something that I maybe shouldn't?"
 "What?"
 "I really like it when you kiss my neck."

Historically, agriculture has also played a major role as an engine for economic growth and employment.
 The Industrial Revolution in nineteenth-century England was spawned by rising productivity and incomes in agriculture that increased demand for manufactured goods.
 In post-war Japan, South Korea, and more recently Thailand, rising agricultural productivity and a shift to commercial crops have been dynamic engines for economic growth, job creation, higher incomes and rural purchasing power, wider markets for produce, and the growth of downstream industries.
 In Taiwan, this was the result of a conscious strategy to utilize agriculture to stimulate job creation and domestic demand.
 The vast technological gap between the levels of agricultural productivity achieved by most developing countries and the highest yields achieved globally represents an enormous untapped potential for stimulating economic growth and job creation.
 The reduction in agricultural subsidies to farmers in industrial nations called for in the recently signed GATT trade agreements will generate far higher international demand for agricultural exports from developing countries.
 In the next chapter, we argue strongly for an agriculture-led job creation strategy and cite evidence to show how it can generate sufficient jobs to eradicate poverty in many countries.
 New deal for the self-employed
 Excluding agriculture, there are 104 million self-employed and unpaid family workers in developing countries, representing 37 per cent of the non-agricultural workforce.
 Self-employed persons and the small firms which they establish have enormous potential for rapidly generating large numbers of new jobs and raising productivity to increase incomes, provided the right policy measures are in place to support them.

His breast plate was solid dark Night Bronze.
 The middle of his breastplate had the symbol of the Immortalists, an eagle soaring up into the clouds.
 In his left hand was the regulation one handed long sword of the guard.
 In his right he held a small round shield.
 The shield did not give much coverage against bows and arrows, but was light and great for blocking hand-to-hand attacks.
 Rodregas swung his short swords in slow circular motions and slowly backed up.
 The two slavers behind the guard apparently had been impressed with the violence so far and stayed in the safety behind the guard instead of separating to each side of him.
 One of the slavers was human, the other a small Orqui or maybe a half breed.
 The human held a long sword, the Orqui a mace.
 Rodregas tried to think of a trick, but nothing came to mind.

The branch was on such a scale that he had to climb the branch coming up its side.
 The bark of the branch was smoother and offered less of a grip.
 Finally he got to the top, which was broad and actually rather cup-like against the main trunk.
 Though he worried about Imeralda, he let himself rest for a moment to recover.
 After a few minutes Rodregas got up and looked around for Imeralda.
 He saw that she was actually far out on another impossibly think branch.
 By the Infernals he swore to himself.
 She was a Forest Nymph.
 He thought he should just leave her there.
 She could do this far easier than he.

"I'm so sorry, Mrs. Campbell.
 I finished early, but I should have started on one of the catch-up assignments.
 I just didn't want to get into a whole new subject with only ten minutes left."
 Her smile was much more understanding than normal for a classroom situation.
 It took the sting out of the words that were probably just for the people close enough to overhear.
 "Don't you worry, Miss Paige, I'll let you know when I don't think you're keeping up.
 Seeing as you are done though, would you please run something over to Mrs. North?
 I'd do it, but I need to go to a special projects meeting today during lunch."
 As quickly as that, my books were in my backpack and I was on my way to the second story of the school, which housed music, sketching, and all the other forms of art lesser mortals like me would never master.
 The journey would've been completely unremarkable except that I happened to glance into one of the classrooms just before I found Mrs. North's room.

He looked for the date of the picture and found that it had been taken in 1926.
 So she was 22 in this picture.
 Hmmm .

 he would have thought that most 22 year olds in the 1920s would be married.
 Especially a girl as beautiful as this one.
 But Tranton was her family name, so she apparently wasn’t.
 Scanning the text on the page opposite the picture, he found a little information about her.
 She’d gotten married at 23—a year after the picture had been taken.

He was gorgeous, and his tan skin seemed to have the slightest hint of light playing beneath its surface.
 I was as plain and ugly as always.
 My response popped out before I could think about it.
 "Only you could see such beauty and think only of keeping it to yourself.
 Trust me, even with surroundings like this I'd much rather be elsewhere if you're part of the bargain."
 The thought of being elsewhere brought our newest crisis to mind, and I realized that it was very likely I wouldn't have to worry about Britney, Alec, or Brandon for very much longer.
 "At least you won't have to suffer my presence for much longer; we'll be gone all too quickly."
 The fact I was saying these things to Alec when I knew this all had to be a dream was ludicrous, but it wasn't as ludicrous as the way he flinched at my words.

I’d need a library, maybe even the Council library.
 I shivered; I definitely wasn’t sure about that.
 Even if I worked up the nerve to sneak in, I didn’t have the magic to search documents to quickly find what I was after like the Council members did.
 I would have to stick to the village library.
 I made a short excuse to Junnie and headed out the door and around back.
 After I rounded a few houses, I cut back toward the village center.
 I wasn’t doing anything wrong, but I didn’t want to flaunt it.

I walked behind him and had to dig my heels in to avoid from slipping down.
 The path ended and Seth had to jump down to reach the bottom.
 He landed gracefully but almost tripped.
 I walked up to the edge of the path and jumped off.
 I flung my arms out to steady myself.
 Seth grinned at my clumsiness and waited for me to walk up to him.
 I wacked his head with the back of my hand, making his hair stick up.
 He smoothed it down and we walked across the flat ground.
 The ground had spots of grass sticking out of sand and rock.
 Luckily, there was no wind down here to toss up the sand and dirt.

“ _Hemorrhage,_ ” the half-orc hissed.
 The elf’s face exploded.
 Qurrah fell over onto his side, breathing as slowly as he could through the blood that filled his throat.
 The dead body of the elf crumpled in front of him, all of his hate-filled features gone from his face except for a single eye.
 The half-orc stared, wondering if his brother was truly dead.
 Darkness crept at the corner of his sight.
 His strength was fading fast, and he had little doubt that if he passed out he would never wake.
 He struggled to lift a single numb hand, then flopped it down on top of the dead elf’s leg.
 Qurrah took as deep a breath as he dared and then spoke the words of a spell.
 Each syllable was slow torture, garbled in blood and born of pain most horrid.

But then again, what would that hurt?
 I accepted the dress from him, looking it over.
 It was poorly made and ill-fitting, but had potential as a design.
 I sat, using magic to work on the seaming and arrange the pearl strands and beading in a more pleasant pattern while deciding how best to deal with him.
 He was watching me intently.
 “We will have such prosperity.
 Think of it, with your magic, we will be able to conquer anything.
 Whatever we need, whatever we want, it will be nothing but a flick of your wrist.” I froze.
 It was irrational, I knew, but anger seethed.
 I couldn’t stop myself from thinking he was just like everyone else, interested only in my powers.

 “I know where he is,” he said.
 “It is all I can see.”
 “Go now,” Velixar said.

 And Qurrah, remember to bring his blade with you.”
 The two brothers bowed and then left to do as their master commanded.

They will not provide an effective system for ensuring the peace and security of all nations that is so vitally needed, and now so imminently possible, as a basis for accelerating the political, economic and social development of humankind.
 The end of the Cold War provides us with the opportunity, and pressing global issues provide the urgency, for more significant measures.
 These measures cannot be conceived within the perspective of international security that has dominated our thinking in the post-war period, or from a half-hearted desire to modestly improve what to some still appears an adequate and acceptable system.
 This is an occasion that demands visionary and courageous leadership to usher in a better world.
 The children of the next millennium will judge us by our response.
 Historically, all landmark changes in the international political and security system have been the result of armed conflicts, wars and revolutions.
 In each case the victors who emerged from the ashes of war sought to build on a static formula for enforcing peace in a dynamic world.
 In each case, the arrangements for conflict termination contained a dynamism that would produce the tensions, disputes and conflicts of the future.
 These in-built limitations and imbalances resist adjustment until a new round of fighting sweeps away the old frame work and replaces it with another, fashioned in much the same way.
 This has been true of the arrangements for international security which have governed international affairs during the present century and which provided the underlying dynamism for the First World War and, when the failed attempt at forming a League of Nations left the world unprepared to deal with fascism, for the Second World War as well.

 “No—no racquetball game.”  When she quirked an eyebrow at him, he admitted, “A brunch.” Her eyes widened.
 “Are you seeing a young lady?

 The wind whirled around me, and I walked over to the dwarf with the others.
 The dwarf was breathing heavily, trying to catch his breath.
 All four of us stood there waiting and when he got his breath back, he spoke.
 “I am glad that you accepted my message,” he said to Seth and me.
 Then he turned to Emily and Jason and said, “Ah, it’s great to meet the other two.” He beamed at all four of us.
 “Hi,” Emily said, looking a little freaked out.
 “So now that you’re here, are we going to get a move on or what?” “Oh of course, follow me please.” He shuffled off and disappeared behind the statue.

 “I’ll get my own, thanks.” He nodded, a knowing smile stretched across his face.
 They turned in opposite directions, each disappearing behind the trees and rocks that strewed the mountain, as I stood alone and confused.
 I sat, shaking my head as I stared down at the bark of the tree.
 Chevelle returned quickly with two small, furred animals slung over his back.
 As his gaze reached the log that lay in front of me, it burst into an orange flame, thin branches forming a spit as he skinned and attached the animals.

Unless greater measures are introduced, this number may rise to more than 160 million by the turn of the century.
 Achieving true universality of primary education by the year 2000 will require a massive investment in school buildings, teachers and instructional materials for an additional 230 million school-age children.
 An additional 4 million teachers will be required, 20 per cent more than in 1990.
 In sub-Saharan Africa, gross primary enrolment will have to double before year 2000 to achieve this goal.
 In addition to the quantitative deficiency in educational enrolment and achievements, the quality of teaching facilities, materials and staff is severely deficient in many countries.
 Most developing countries hire teachers with only a secondary school certificate and a minimum of teachers’ training.
 This contributes to the high rate of primary school drop-outs and grade repetition.
 Only 71 per cent of first-grade entrants complete primary school in developing countries.
 Addressing these challenges will require a substantial increase in financial resources devoted to education.
 In most regions, public expenditure on education has risen in recent years.

I like to learn,” he said slowly but carefully.
 The big guy was embarrassed.
 Then he added, “I am afraid my people are not big readers, and, well, they saw me as half-monster and I never learned how to read.” The last words he added very slowly, but then quickly added, “But if you can teach me some basics from the oral techniques that Imeralda mentioned, I would like to learn some magic if I can.” Rodregas looked at Doi’van; there was something about his expression, a yearning.
 “Do you want to learn to read?” he asked.
 “What do you mean?” Doi’van asked, stepping away from the other two like he was uncomfortable.
 “Just what I said, would you like to learn to read?” Rodregas said in a carefully casual voice.
 Doi’van responded, “We don’t have time for me to learn to read.
 You should spend time practicing with these Grimoires.
 It makes no sense to teach me to read when we are likely to see battle too soon for it to be helpful.” Doi’van’s voice, which was always deep, seemed to have gone down several octaves, such that the earth almost seemed to vibrate.
 Somehow, while the conversation on magic Grimoires had been of interest to him, the idea of learning to read seemed to terrify him.

CHAPTER FOUR
 Marie sat beside Rick at the library, watching in amazement as titles of books and magazines appeared on a screen in front of him.
 Whenever he found something that he thought could help them, a machine in front of her would print the title and its number on a piece of paper.
 She'd thought it would take hours and hours to find a handful of books.
 But in only 45 minutes Rick had a long list of books and articles.
 He filled out request forms for the articles and led her into more rows of books than she'd ever seen.
 He pulled out book after book, stacking them in her arms.
 When both had as many as they could carry, they went to check them out.
 "We have 17 books and 21 articles," Rick told her when they were back at his house with their materials spread out on the floor in front of them.
 "I don't even know where to start."

I listened to it alone in my parent’s living room, hearing sounds that transformed me as surely as did Lorelei, the finding of my own voice.
 “Talkin World War III Blues” was beyond my ken.
 I thought, perhaps, my head would explode.
 I didn’t understand.
 In my reptile brain I have also the memory of my friend Ricky Adams’ big brother having “folk” albums, some by a handsome, young, angular-faced singer named Bob Dylan, whose songs were meant as social anthems, wrong-righters.
 I didn’t know what to make of these threnodies.

 Then his cousin is slain bearing a message to this town, his head left at the gate of our city.
 Paranoia it might be, but it is justified.”
 Antonil quieted.
 Dieredon watched him, amazed just how young the man could still look in the moonlight.

It didn't make any sense.
 I'd never done anything to him.
 Did he really hate me so much just because I'd told him off about not protecting Rachel?
 Cassie was waiting for me at my locker when I got there.
 "Brandon wanted me to stop by and let you know he had a few things to take care of, so he won't see you during lunch.
 You can still come sit with us if you want."
 The words were right.
 If I'd been reading them off of a page in a book, I probably would've believed them, but the way she delivered them left no doubt in my mind.
 She didn't want me at their table.
 The only reason she'd stopped by my locker was because Brandon had told her to.

I hurried forward, sure I was about to lose both her and the route.
 When I topped the rock, I froze, taking a heartbeat too long to drop to my stomach.
 Just over that ridge stood a group of elves, though after my pulse settled, I didn’t think they’d seen me before I’d fallen back.
 I wasn’t quite close enough to hear, but didn’t see a better vantage point.
 I squinted, examining the figures.
 Ruby’s red curls gave her away.
 She had tossed back the hood of her cloak and was laughing with a large elf.
 Steed, I was almost sure because of his stance.
 I scanned the darkness and found two other figures.
 One was about the size of Steed; the other was thinner and appeared fidgety, even in the darkness.

 Harruq scoffed.
 “You have no chance,” he said.

 “Guess you need a reminder of who you’re learning from.” He lowered his weapons and thrust out his chest.
 “Here.

 "Luuuucy!

 Rick watched without seeing and listened without hearing as Ricky and Lucy fought.
 It had been Marie's favorite show.
 She'd been gone four days.
 He'd sat in the garden until nearly 9:00 Tuesday evening.
 He'd slept hardly at all that night, but he dragged himself to work anyway, not wanting to spend all day alone in the house.
 He'd gotten practically nothing done, and coming home at 8:30 had been torture.

The Knight Captain called for a squire, who he commanded to find them a room.
 Rodregas sensed that the Knight Captain was not happy with what had happened, but he said no word of apology.
 As the three were led away, Rodregas asked the boy the name of the sorcerer at the table.
 “That is the Immortalist Van’dret, Ambassador to the Knights from the Guild.
 He is very powerful you know.
 We are told to do whatever he commands, but also told to stay as far away from him as possible,” said the young boy, who could not have been much more than twelve years old.
 Rodregas nodded and said, “Sounds like good advice.” Rodregas looked up as Doi’van and Imeralda entered the room.
 Doi’van looked grim.
 But as Rodregas assumed no one had died, he had to smile.
 “Is it that bad?” he asked.

 "I suppose we make quite the pair, her and I.

 He hugged me to him as he shook his head.
 "Not an imposition.

 "Yes.

 And I was right."
 Her tears spilled over.

Rachel's mauve dress was probably the most conservative of all, neither over-snug, nor especially low-cut.
 It had seemed entirely out of character considering what she'd purchased for the rest of us, but when I'd asked, she'd just grimaced and said Alec would've made her stay home if she'd chosen anything more daring.
 None of which helped me feel any more comfortable in the tight, strapless wonder Rachel had been so excited to give me.
 Even with all of the weight I'd lost since the accident, it still felt like the material was fighting a losing battle to stretch itself over my frame.
 I'd been hoping to be able to put off actually putting the dress on for at least another half hour, but when my makeup had finally been pronounced satisfactory, Jasmin had studied me for a few minutes, pulled my hair back, secured it with a pair of silver combs I was worried might actually contain genuine diamonds, and then helped Rachel cram me into the dress.
 If Jessica hadn't grudgingly complimented me on just how good my hair looked, I might have suspected Jasmin was trying to purposefully make me look worse than the other girls.
 Dominic and Rachel had to tell me I looked good, that was an unwritten girl-rule regardless of what species you were.
 Jessica had no such imperative, so I was forced to conclude Jasmin had done the best she could considering what she had to work with, and resigned myself to being the homely one in the group.
 Still, seeing all of the other girls in one place, fully decked out in the kind of shoes I'd always wanted to wear, but never been able to pull off, was even more intimidating.
 I was once again psyching myself up to be seen in public, when Donovan limped into the room and cleared his throat.

His ex-girlfriend, Tiffanie, met us at the storage unit to claim her belongings.
 She looked about twenty pounds heavier and it was good weight.
 Tiffanie had been clean and sober since her last relapse in the rehab center.
 They smiled at each other and commented on their vast physical changes.
 They knew their life as a couple was over and that they had both gone their separate ways, while both going in the same positive direction—off drugs—despite astronomical odds.
 The conversation they had was all about sobriety and how wonderful it was to be clean.
 They both had big smiles and clear eyes and they looked like a couple of healthy young people, and that is exactly what they were.
 I also took the opportunity to arrange a meeting at a Starbucks, a reunion of sorts.
 I had stayed in contact with Officer White by e-mailing him updates on Brandon’s progress as a courtesy to him and as a bit of a reward.
 I thanked him for busting my son.

The relatively high interest rates in Europe, resulting in part from tight monetary policies pursued by Germany to offset the enormous costs of reunification, have had adverse effects on investment, growth and employment in the region.
 More recent rate increases in the US threaten to halt the declining trend in unemployment observed over the past year.
 The extreme disruption of the centrally planned economies of Eastern Europe during the early stages of their transition to market economies has led to high domestic unemployment in most cases.
 Slow recovery from the recent global recession has restrained the growth of foreign trade.
 Down-sizing by major corporations in response to intense competitive pressures has eliminated many jobs which are not being restored, even after the recession is over.
 Privatization and restructuring of public sector companies in response to fiscal pressures has had a similar effect.
 In the United Kingdom alone, an estimated 500,000 jobs will be lost for this reason in 1994.
 The impact of structural adjustments programmes has slowed economic growth and new job creation in a number of developing countries.
 Gains in productivity due to new technology, particularly delayed gains from the micro-computer revolution of the 1980s and the growth of factory automation, have slowed job growth in some industries.
 The increasing competitiveness of the NIEs of Asia and most recently China has displaced jobs in the West, primarily unskilled jobs.

 "Alec's finally fallen in love, and with such a lovely girl.
 I was half worried he was going to spend the rest of his life so mired in responsibility, he'd never let himself notice anyone."
 I was flabbergasted, but my lack of response didn't faze her in the slightest.
 "I take it he finally realized you aren't a shape shifter then?"
 Apparently my astonishment leaked through to my expression, that or maybe she could just smell the shock on me.
 Whatever the reason, her smile took on new intensity, and she slowly reached out and clasped my hand again.
 "I'm sorry; I spend so much of my time alone with my thoughts that they develop well-worn grooves.
 I forget sometimes that other people haven't been privy to the endless hours of speculation that got me from one point to another."

By now some of the sharper edges to the emotion had worn away.
 I shrugged, dropping my book and binder on the floor next to my bed.
 Dwelling on the guilt would just make me think about why I felt guilty in the first place.
 I'd find myself on the floor with no memory of how I'd gotten there.
 By the time I'd brushed my teeth and finished the rest of my nightly ritual, my mind was wholly in the present, and I was starting to get a little depressed.
 I'd never particularly fit in back home, but there'd been enough other people in various fringe groups that I'd always felt like I had somewhere to go if I ever wanted more friends.
 I would've had to play a role to a certain extent, which was why I'd never made the effort, but the option had always been there.
 It didn't look like that'd be a possibility in Sanctuary.
 In an entire day I'd had exactly one person try and befriend me.
 As much as I appreciated the effort, I couldn't shake the feeling Britney was befriending me mostly because she didn't have any other options.

By the time Mom realized I was missing, I'd be a perfectly preserved mummy, sucked completely dry by the harsh climate, exactly as ordered for a pyramid burial.
 I hadn't realized some part of me was hoping Mom would be there waiting when I got home.
 I felt it shrink as I came around the corner and saw the empty cement pad.
 I walked through the door and dropped my things on the couch.
 I could feel myself sinking back into oblivion, but instead of welcoming it, I was suddenly terrified.
 I'd spent weeks numb to the entire world.
 I'd even missed Dad's favorite season, the one that'd become mine as well.
 It'd be all too easy to slip into the same kind of numbness now as a refuge against everything.
 What would happen if I failed to surface?
 It'd been easier to lapse into catatonia this time than last.

Sylvia Curtis was a large blonde with a pinched mouth and squinty, penetrating eyes.
 Even back then, before she reached forty, she wore nothing belted, only shapeless dresses and muumuus.
 She charged around the house with steps so tiny you might wonder if her feet had once gotten bound.
 A unique mother, or at least the opposite of most, she treated her son with great respect and the rest of us with very little.
 She didn’t baby Eric.
 Rather, from all I saw, he might’ve been the only human she considered her equal.
 But I rarely saw her with people.
 Now and then I would find her on the porch with a neighbor, gossiping about a different neighbor, but the only ones who got inside her dark little house were Eric and his friends, and Richard.
 He was a jazz pianist about ten years younger than Sylvia, and half a head shorter than either Eric or she.
 Just as Sylvia’s bluster made people wrongly suppose she was a drunk, Richard’s stupefied expression made me suspect he was a junkie.

I looked and to my surprise it was bending down to let Emily stroke its head.
 She patted its head and it curled up outside the cave.
 She bent down to whisper something in its ear and then stood up again.
 “Well,” she said looking at us, “what are you waiting for?” She disappeared in the cave.
 Then she poked her head out.
 “Come on!” We walked slowly into the cave.
 I glanced over at the dragon, which was now asleep and making small puffs of smoke in the rain.
 I sat on the cold stone floor, shivering.
 I was soaked to the skin and my hair was completely plastered to my head.
 Seth sat next to me and I could see he was shivering too.

With the physical essence of the lion now part of his new body, and the magic of the sorcerer Ravenhurr, he would be an extremely talented person.
 That everything had gone so well was simply a god-sent miracle.
 He had rescued the maiden and killed the sorcerer.
 Of course the man's soul and intellect had been destroyed and a lion from the realm of the gods itself had been destroyed.
 It was far from a perfect victory, but Rodregas knew there were never perfect victories.
 He had had more luck in the last half hour than in his entire downtrodden life.
 Then, the next revelation hit him; maybe the Celestial Gods had answered his prayers.
 He had promised the Gods that if he lived, it would become his sworn duty to take down the Immortalists.
 Rodregas’ new heart seemed to stop for a moment at that thought and a chill ran down his body.
 There were supposed to be well over a hundred Immortalists in the Eastern Realms, each one incredibly powerful.

The officers then recorded my call to Ashley where I told her my wife had me watching the kids and unavailable until she returned, so I’d call her in a while.
 I was buying an unknown amount of time while keeping Ashley and Steve on the hook.
 So while I am standing in the lot wired up, not able to call my wife, not able to go anyplace myself, some of the officers take orders for a hamburger run!
 I am now beyond irritated, as their lackadaisical attitude could equal another disappointment and a setback for the mission to get my son on with his life and out of a possible prison sentence.
 They asked me what I wanted from the nearby hamburger joint as they relayed orders to another officer via a cell phone.
 I wanted nothing!
 Eating was the last thing on my mind and my stomach was churning with every passing moment.
 I just wanted to get on with it and go home in one piece.
 It was an odd sight for me as I watched these officers chow down their burgers and sip on their drinks reminiscing about the drug deal they just finished.
 Just another day at the office, I guess.

Rodregas said, “The local lord is responsible for replacing the other lord messenger’s lame horse.
 There is nothing to be done for the Immortalist messenger’s horse.
 It is the responsibility of the local lords to provide mounts for the Guild at the local lord’s expense.” He made sure his voice remained rough with no emotion coloring his response, just a simple squire giving a by-the-book answer.
 The Knight Captain nodded and said, “Welcome to the tournament, Squire.” He then turned to look up at the sorcerer and asked him, “Any other questions Ambassador?” The sorcerer spoke his next question directly to Rodregas, “I noticed you have a Hellborn at your side, you would insult the faith of the Knights by bringing him into the Cathedral of the Heavens?” Rodregas knew this question would come up and had the natural answer, “They are my sworn followers.
 Sworn to the All-Father.” Such an oath could not be challenged here.
 “Truly?” the sorcerer said.
 “The Great Oath of Fealty for one of Infernal birth?
 I would see that.” He turned to Doi’van who loomed over all of them.
 Doi’van had watched the show with a cold interest.
 The sorcerer spoke with a command that dripped venom, “On your knees Hellborn and swear the oath of fealty, in the name of the All-Father to this squire where we can all see.” Doi’van paused for a heartbeat and then pulled his sword out in a smooth gesture and for a moment Rodregas was thinking that a battle was to be had, but then Doi’van dropped to his knees in front of Rodregas.

With the memory came concern for Doi’van and Imeralda, and a surge of adrenaline that gave him the energy to try to wake up.
 Rodregas tried to sit up, but his body, which had been so strong since that day at Raven Keep, now only responded sluggishly.
 He was sleepy, but had the idea that he had been sleeping a very long time.
 Yet, his body still felt exhausted.
 Rodregas must have moved enough to get some attention because a man, or to be more accurate, an adult male Nymph, moved into his sight.
 Rodregas was always surprised by the amount of hair coming out of the ears of an adult Nymph.
 He was glad that was one trait that Imeralda did not seem to have.
 He knew the thought to be a silly one even as it crossed his mind.
 It was quickly replaced with concern.
 For a second he thought that he was tied down, but Rodregas could see enough to determine that his restraints were tightly tucked bed sheets.

Rick set the pizza on the table and picked up some change to go get them some Cokes.
 He knew Marie would be embarrassed.
 Women of 1927 weren't supposed to be so forward with a man, even if they weren't, as she was, engaged to another.
 But her kiss and the way she'd touched him made him think that maybe he could win her love.
 Maybe he could convince her to stay in 2011 with him.
 He returned to the room with the Cokes and opened the box.
 "Mmm—it smells great."
 He put a slice on a plate and handed it to her.
 "Thank you," she mumbled, not looking at him.
 "Marie."

 Wanting to prolong the moment as long as possible, she asked him, "What is it?"
 "Open it and see."
 She took it, glancing at his face as she raised the lid.
 The sapphire immediately caught the light, and she gasped.
 "This is beautiful!"
 He reached out to take her hand.
 "Marie, will you marry me?"
 She gazed at him for a moment before crying, "Yes!"
 and throwing her arms around his neck.

Immediate steps can, and should, be taken to negotiate reductions to this minimum level.
 The relaxation of tensions has drawn public attention away from this issue and reduced the momentum for progress at the very time when there is the greatest opportunity finally to eliminate this threat completely.
 The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which ensures the military superiority of the nuclear powers over other signatories, is an instance of rule by strength forcibly imposed by the major powers on the rest of the world community in the name of peace.
 It is neither equitable nor justifiable.
 Already, 156 countries have signed the treaty, owing either to coercion or indifference, and the number is expected to increase to 170 out of 179 states by 1995.
 The acceptance of non-proliferation by these countries further delegitimizes the continued possession of nuclear weapons by any country.
 All of the treaty non-signatories can be persuaded to sign in exchange for annihilation of these weapons by those that now possess them.
 Under these circumstances, refusal to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty could be considered sufficient grounds for expulsion from UN membership.
 Without a universal ban, the efforts of the nuclear powers to stop proliferation lack moral authority.
 Arguments are often advanced that nuclear weapons cannot be ‘dis-invented’, and that the danger of a rogue state or terrorist group acquiring and threatening use of these weapons necessitates that the present nuclear powers retain them for such a contingency.

The map on my palms was gone.
 My skin was unmarked, no indication whatsoever it had even been burned.
 Is this our destination?
 My gaze shot up to find the village, and then I hastily clicked my heels when I realized I was being left behind.
 As we advanced, I could see movement amongst the elves.
 There was much activity, but it was nothing like home.
 No flags of quilts and rugs blowing in the breeze, no bright sunlight on a rainbow of colors, no dancing in the village center.
 A raucous sound traveled up to us and Chevelle waved a hand, his magic bringing the hood of my cloak up to cover my head and then his own.
 At once, my stomach was a knot again.
 We rode into town at a walk; Chevelle was sitting straight and tall in his saddle but his arm hung casually, hand resting on his leg.

 It was kind of an escape after everyone started gaining their wolf form.

 He'd sunk down beside me while he was talking, resting with his hands behind his head so he could look up at the few thinly-stretched clouds.
 I took the opportunity to move closer, cuddling up next to him.
 I didn't bother looking up at the sky.
 Truth be told, I had all the beauty I needed right in front of me.
 His slight start as my head came to rest on his arm was disappointing but entirely predictable.
 He adjusted my blanket slightly so it was between us and then pulled me closer.
 He was perfectly happy to touch me as long as there wasn't any actual skin on skin contact.

Qurrah broke away from his brother when the last died before them.
 He could smell the fear of the villagers, and like a tracking dog he could use it to find where they fled.
 Flames danced across the side of one house, alerting Qurrah.
 The half-orc coiled the whip around his arm and pulled out a scrap of bone from a pouch.
 It was time to test the spells his master had taught him.
 An elderly man came around the corner, a torch his only weapon.
 He glared at Qurrah with unabashed hatred.
 “ _Weakness_ ,” the necromancer hissed in the wispy tongue of magic.
 The old man dropped his torch and wobbled on his legs.
 His elderly arms, already shriveled, shrunk even more.

However, a number of strategies are relevant to the majority of developing countries.
 Some of the components of an Action Plan designed to achieve this goal are given below.
 1.Elimination of agricultural trade barriers by industrial nations.
 The agreements reached for liberalizing agricultural trade in the Uruguay Round of GATT are an important step forward, but they will not release the full dynamism of the agricultural sector, which is so critical for more rapid growth of incomes and employment in both developing and developed countries.
 In the previous chapter, we have called for rapid reduction leading to a complete elimination of agricultural subsidies and other trade barriers by industrial nations, which can generate a positive multiplier effect.
 It has been estimated that complete liberalization of trade in agricultural commodities would yield an annual gain (in 1992 dollars) of about $25 billion for OECD countries and $22 billion for developing and formerly centrally planned countries.
 Actual gains could be very much higher.
 These subsidies cost Western consumers several hundred billion dollars annually.
 In addition, they lead to dumping of surplus sugar, cereal, milk and beef in developing countries, often pushing down the prices which farmers in these countries receive for their produce to far below their production cost.
 The benefits of eliminating these subsidies would be multiple.

 But I can’t wait until September!
 And what if that book isn’t right?” Rick hugged Marie, wiping away her tears.
 He led her inside and made her breakfast, which she barely touched.
 Nothing he said drew much of a response from her.
 He hated leaving her when she was so upset, but after a week’s vacation, he had a ton of work at the office.
 “Call me if you need anything, sweetheart,” he told her, kissing the top of her head just before he left.

Those bows had primarily been ornamental trophies for Ravenhurr; Rodregas thought that they symbolized a previous victory.
 Only a few of the guards would have had the power to use them and Ravenhurr kept guards with even small power away from the keep.
 Against the leather armor of the slavers there would be no defense, even if they had shields; the arrows would likely blast through anything they had.
 Of course, against the Immortalist guards it was a different matter; their armor would stop the arrows.
 And, of course, their weapons would be equally effective against his armor, going through it like butter and into his flesh if he was not fast enough.
 Depending on their sigils, they were likely to be either faster or stronger or both.
 But Rodregas’ short swords would not cut their armor.
 It put them at an extreme disadvantage.
 As the arrows flew over his head, he became aware of the other disadvantage of bows.
 They were dealing with a limited supply of arrows; once the arrows where all shot, they lost their main advantage.

“If the elves win, Vaelor will have no choice but to leave them be.
 The assault of my orcs has weakened his army.

 A grin spread wide across his ever-changing face, chilling Harruq’s spine.
 “If the humans win, the elves will declare full scale war against the kingdom of Neldar.
 So which side do you think will have the privilege of our blades and magic?”
 “We will kill the elves,” Harruq said.

“By the gods, what is that?”
 Harruq followed the man’s upward gaze but saw only clear night sky.
 “Keep it away from me!” the man shouted as Qurrah released his hand and backed away.
 A glint of pleasure shone in his eyes as he watched his handiwork.
 The nobleman struggled against the ropes, his gaze locked on the sky.
 “Please, no, take it away, I’ll do anything, anything, just keep it away.
 Don’t let it touch me, please, please, DON’T LET IT TOUCH ME!”
 The man screamed for the next two minutes.
 Then he died.
 “What did you do to him?” Harruq asked once the man was dead.

“You’re my watcher.” It still sounded angry, so I added, “Why?” He hesitated.
 “Frey…” His voice was gentle and he seemed to be searching for a way to answer.
 He must have decided I had no right to anger, because his face turned hard, his tone formal.
 “The council was concerned after you tried to choke Evelyn of Rothegarr.” I drew a sharp breath.
 “What are you talking about?” It caught me off guard; I was more than offended.
 Does he really think I choked Evelyn?
 I bit down against my words, remembering the trouble I was already in with Council.
 But that brought on an image of the speaker’s discolored face as he struggled for air, the blackened thistle in the back room at Junnie’s.
 Evelyn’s expression as she ran from the garden was accusing, and it suddenly seemed right.
 I swayed, my vision losing focus.

Chevelle nodded, but made no remark on the inquirer.
 Ruby winked at him on her way out and the gesture lit a burn in my chest.
 I turned back to my room and climbed into bed, angry at myself more than anything else, and determined not to let him see.
 I covered my head with a corner of the blanket, suffocating my fractured thoughts with the absence of light.
 I was unsure how long I’d slept.
 The house was quiet when I slipped from bed, trying not to make a sound.
 I peeked into the main room, finding Chevelle sitting against the front wall, a small window over his head.
 He leaned over, working on something in the palm of his hand, a steady scratching accompanying the movement of his wrist.
 I started forward and my boot scuffed the floor, alerting him to my presence.
 As he glanced up, he slid whatever he’d been working on into a pocket at his hip.

 Anyway, she took one look at this patch on my ass and drew in her breath as if I had a picture of a couple fucking on my jeans—she literally turned white.
 And sent me to the office, with a note recommending my suspension.
 I laugh now, but, hell, I was a little frightened.
 I mean, I hated school, right?
 but I didn’t want to be kicked out of it.

What could it hurt, really?
 Sure, I could marry him, but it wouldn’t be real, I knew that.
 But the other part, well, I could do that without the marriage, couldn’t I?
 Harmless fun… I smiled as I leaned closer to him.
 This was the first time I had initiated a kiss and he was grateful—more than grateful… overwhelmed with pleasure.
 I laughed to myself at what was to come, if this small, insignificant gesture brought him so much happiness.
 Our lips touched and he gasped, and then the breath turned to a low moan.
 I rubbed the back of my hand over a cheek, trying to clear away the blush of color.
 The encounter was very… descriptive.
 I threw a wary glance over my shoulder, making sure Ruby was still at the window as I continued.

Just last night he'd told her that they couldn't kiss like that unless they got married.
 And this morning he dared to kiss her that way, knowing that it would make her all but forget her walk!
 When she returned to the house nearly half an hour later, she stormed past him and up to her room.
 Rick knew for sure that she was mad this time, knew why, and knew he'd been wrong to do what he'd done.
 "Sweetheart, I'm sorry," he called running after her.
 "I shouldn't have done it.
 I just wanted you to know--"  He heard her door slam.
 Going upstairs to knock on it, he called, "Marie, please come out and talk to me."
 He paused.
 "I'm sorry.

"For this evening.

 "I think so too.

 "Almost?"
 He stopped, turning to face her.
 They were in the dappled shadows of early blossoms, and he drew her into his arms to kiss her gently.
 Marie's heart pounded as she kissed him back.
 His kisses were rare, so she savored each one, clinging to him and hoping that it would go on forever.
 But he ended this one all too soon, raising his head to gaze down into her sparkling eyes.

Ice spread from house to house, walling Velixar off on the other side.
 “From dirt to ice?” Velixar asked.
 “The end is just the same!”
 The center of the wall exploded inward, but this time Aurelia was prepared.
 A rolling thunder of sound shoved all the broken shards forward, sending even the remaining chunks of the wall down the street in a chaotic assault.
 Velixar grinned.
 Clever girl.
 The wave of sound and ice slammed his body.
 He flew backward, ice tearing his skin, but no blood came forth from those wounds.
 The larger pieces smashed his body from side to side, which turned limply with each blow.

He leaned against the statue next to Emily, giving us both feeble smiles.
 “So,” he said, trying to sound happy, “travel day today, huh?” We didn’t answer.
 “Okay looks like I’ll do the talking,” Jason said.
 “You two excited?” Emily shook her head.
 “No, Jason we’re both jumping for joy, but it’s so deep down that instead we both look like we want to slug you,” I said sarcastically.
 Jason sighed, “Okay, you would say something like that.
 I thought in a mood like this you would be less…annoying.” As soon as he finished his sentence, I wacked him as hard as I could.
 Seth showed up after that, placed his bag on the ground, leaned on the statue next to me, and didn’t say a word.
 We all stood there waiting for the dwarf to show up.
 Right as I was about to give up and say we had the wrong place, he appeared.

Marie liked touching him.
 He was big and muscular, and she'd thought that just looking at him without his shirt was a great pleasure.
 But that was before she'd gotten to run her hands over him.
 After a few minutes she stopped and lay down with a sigh.
 The beach was beautiful, and the air smelled so good.
 She liked being here with Rick.
 All morning he'd looked at her like she was a goddess.
 Or a cone of ice cream.
 She giggled at the thought.
 Wondering if Rick had heard her, she glanced over at him.

He slowly reached up, and using the full strength of his body, pushed hard on her muscular chest, pushing her away from the bear’s haunch.
 He then ignored her and went back to cutting the haunch loose.
 He waited but the two lionesses seemed to have gone from aggression to napping, with him missing the transition.
 Slowly, Rodregas got up with his bear haunch and took it back to the barn.
 He met the surprised look of Doi’van and Imeralda with a half smile, “I hope you like the taste of bear?” As he was unsure of how old the meat was, he immediately started a fire and started to cook it.
 As he worked on preparing the fire he explained what had happened.
 “Are you suicidal?” asked Imeralda in an angry voice.
 “I know you felt they were not a danger, but to walk up and take the food from two Dire Cats?
 That is just asking to be killed.” Her voice was unusually high pitched and she was shaking her head in disbelief.
 “The Dire Bear must have been living in the cellar,” said Doi’van.

He looked up at me through his lashes, past his furrowed brow, and then brought me a piece of meat.

 I sat stunned.

 I wanted to scream, but the words wouldn’t come.
 I was too drained.
 And I was scared.
 I didn’t know what had happened, what was wrong with me, but I was certain whatever it was, Chevelle would take me straight back to the village.
 We stayed there for some time, a fact for which I was grateful.

It's amazing how quickly you can pack when it's for someone else, and they aren't around to tell you what you can or can't throw into their suitcase.
 Even with my lack of sleep starting to catch up with me, I was still essentially done by the time Mom wandered into her room, staring at her phone like she wasn't sure it was really possible for it to have just told her what she'd just heard.
 "He says it's fine.
 He'll swing by next week to pick up the shots I think are the most promising, and then he'll see if he can't put the brochure together from that."
 She noticed the suitcases and the empty hangers for the first time.
 "Honey, there isn't any reason to be in such a hurry.
 We haven't really decided to take the job yet, and even if we do, I'm sure we won't be able to arrange a flight for another day or two."
 Right.
 If Alec really had arranged this incredible trip, literally overnight, he'd have her on a plane much faster than anyone else would've believed possible.
 "Mom, we've already gone through every single one of your objections, and they've all been taken care of.

Guns were one of the first products of mass production.
 In the modern era, society has become the principle target and victim of war.
 With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, technology and economic activity in support of fighting forces became an increasingly significant factor.
 As a result, more and more effort was directed at eliminating or crippling the enemy’s economic and industrial capacity and the ‘national will’ to wage war.
 Targeting of civilian populations became increasingly common.
 In the two world wars in this century, opposing sides waged all-out war against the military, political, economic and social resources and capacities of the enemy society.
 The strategic bombings of the Second World War, the fire-bombing of Tokyo, and the nuclear devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki took this concept to the extreme.
 As a result, the ratio of military to civilian casualties in military conflicts changed dramatically.
 In the First World War, there were 20 military casualties for each civilian death.
 In the Second World War, the ratio was one to one.

 “Can you tell me your name?” “Elfreda,” I answered immediately.
 He waited for the rest.
 But I had two answers, didn’t I?
 I chose.
 “Of North Camber.” It must have been the right answer, because he grabbed me, exultant, sighing and kissing my skin.
 He held me with a fierceness, a gentleness, that took my breath.
 His lips trailed my cheeks, murmuring words and careful of wounds as they swept to a temple, my eyelid, the corner of my mouth.
 He lingered there, unable to resist touching the broken skin of my lips, even if it were only feather light, the barest brush of skin.
 He drew away slowly, feeling my shock, or seeing it in my eyes, and realizing his mistake.

 I think he’s happier now, doing his own shit, not having to answer to anybody except John Lennon.
 That’s the way I am.
 I mean, I’m not claiming to be Lennon—Jesus, no—but, I was always a solo artist and in the straightjacket of a group I was itching to get to the good stuff, the stuff I cared about.
 It’s not worth grousing about, I mean, I had a good run in that group, but my solo albums are the only ones I care about.
 So, sophomore year, Debby is gone—well, I cut her loose, I’m not proud of it.
 There was this freshman chick with big tits who just threw herself in my way.
 I mean, she was just there one day, in hotpants, and this tight, satin shirt, and I thought, “Man, I want to suck those.”  Men.
 You know, like I say, I’m not proud of my younger self, but, as Lor says, it’s all real, it’s all honest.
 We are what we are, what we were.

Poor guy still had to keep smelling it though, and then Qurrah cast his spell.
 “The meat started bubbling and turning watery.
 It ran down his face, getting into his eyes.
 It burned him.
 His skin turned black, like it was rotting.
 He called me dogface all the time, Perry did.
 We were making him just like what he called me.
 A dogface.
 But it went wrong.
 I yelled at Qurrah to stop, and I think he wanted to, but he kept shrieking more of that curse.

When I arrived at home I called Officer White’s phone and told him I had a drug deal set up with Steve and Ashley and they wanted one hundred Oxy pills.
 To say he was shocked would be an understatement.
 He wanted to know how I did this and was I sure it was Steve, as well as numerous other questions.
 I told him that he had told me he didn’t want to know anything, and I preferred to keep it that way for now.
 I did give Officer White enough information so he was sure I had the right people.
 I just needed to know when and where the narcotics squad wanted to do this deal and what I needed to do next.
 The Officer was excited at the opportunity to get this guy and he arranged me coming to the police station so I could make the call to set up the one hundred Oxy pill deal on a recorded phone line.
 The drug deal itself would happen later and I would need to be evasive and the where and the when as to the actual exchange of money for drugs.
 I was told to call her from my phone and tell her I would call her tomorrow around noon.

“Goodnight Emily.” “Goodnight Jazell.” I drifted off, feeling surprising comfy against Seth's shoulder and hearing Jason softy snore.
 I opened my eyes to see myself standing in the woods.
 The sky saw clearer and it wasn't raining anymore.
 It was eerie quiet and as I stood there it felt like I had never left the woods.
 I heard a voice whispering one word over and over again.
 “Jazell...” “What?” I called.
 “What do you want?” “Jazell...” the voice whispered again.
 “Jazell.” “What?” I screamed into the trees.
 “What do you want?
 Why do you have to repeat my name over and over again, it's creepy.” “Jazell, beware,” it whispered again.

 He swallowed.
 "You are an incredibly passionate woman, Marie.

 Her throat was suddenly sore.
 "I-I think you have some lint on your back."
 She embraced him, whispering, "Thank you for everything.
 I'll miss you too."
 She gave him a smile before turning and walking into the garden.
 When she found herself at the edge of it, she veered right, seeing that it extended farther in that direction.
 She deliberately tried to lose herself, since that was how she'd gotten to 2011.

Brandon's grin was wider even than before.
 "Ah, but those aren't the laws under which we labor now, are they?
 She's mine, and I have every right to do whatever I wish to her.
 Her presence among your pack is a direct affront to my rights and honor.
 I could demand your life, be glad I'm only requiring two of your pack."
 Alec shook his head, face more emotionless than even a second before.
 "By the same laws set down by Adjam and Inock when they first took mates from among the dayborn, I challenge your bond of Ja'tell.
 I challenge your standing among the people, and your personal honor.
 The dispute between us is such as can only be settled by blood."
 For a brief second it seemed Brandon had been taken by surprise, but he regained his equilibrium while I was still trying to understand what was being said.

There’s nothing more dangerous than a lawyer with time on his hands.
 Lessee, the other two cuts, are “Laurie Had Thighs Like Opinici” and “Melody Came as a Lichtenstein Painting.”  Two originals that I’ve never used.
 “Laurie” is a blues—a beat I stole from Fred McDowell—that almost makes it.
 The lyrics didn’t gel, I don’t think.
 Written from pain, written in dread—so, well, it ain’t exactly art.
 “Melody” is something altogether different.
 An early composition that is still pretty pretty.
 I’ve tried over the years to work it into something passable, something acoustic for a new album, but, well, I’m still trying.
 Its appearance on this Great Black Wonder especially rankles, because it’s a song I want to get right.

 Harruq sat there, clutching her hands in his and waiting.
 The seconds crawled slower than the longest of years.

 His tears fell onto her bloodstained dress.
 For far too long, she did not move.

I'm afraid something has come up.
 Will you be okay here for a few hours?"
 Normal human response was to make a little white lie, but I got the feeling I wouldn't be able to get away with lying to Alec.
 "I rather suspect whatever 'came up' is important enough I'll just have to be okay."
 He flinched a little, like maybe my aim had been a little too true.
 He looked for a moment like he was going to say something, but then his phone started vibrating again, and he simply nodded as he turned and walked away, moving much faster by himself than he did when I was with him.
 As I stared at the empty space where he'd been standing just a second before, I felt my chest start to constrict, and my breathing speed up.
 The sense of terror racing along my synapses was completely irrational, and extraordinarily powerful.
 Just as the room began to spin crazily around me, I felt a gentle touch on my shoulder.

Cassie picked me up with one hand and gave me a hard shove back towards the road.
 I almost fell.
 Considering just how rugged the terrain was, it was a good thing I didn't, because I probably would've broken my neck.
 It was still a near thing, but once I was moving reflex kept me headed in the right direction.
 Tears were flowing freely down my cheeks, and my heart seemed to be missing every second beat, almost like a hole had been torn in it and now it was a battle to continue beating, when it just wanted to quit.
 I did fall down when I hit the first slope.
 There was just enough moonlight to confirm that the pain in my hands and elbow was the result of having all of the skin abraded away.
 I thought I was going to pass out, or maybe throw up, but I couldn't cry any harder than I already was.
 Part of me kept expecting Brandon to come running towards me from the direction of the party.
 He'd apologize, and explain how he'd wanted to stop Cassie, but he'd been too stunned by what she was doing.

He heard nothing but his stomach rumble; he was very hungry and knew that he should eat.
 He was already in the main hall; the room to the right was the kitchen.
 He stepped into the kitchen but then came to a sudden stop.
 Standing next to one of the sinks was a very old, very dirty kitchen drudge slowly peeling a potato.
 She looked up at him in surprise, and with a hint of fear.
 Rodregas raised his hand up in a peaceful motion.

Possibly that was his plan.
 If she'd totally abandoned him then her children would've all died."
 I felt my eyelids begin to flutter, as my breathing slowed to match Alec's.
 "Whether that was his intent or not, the Sun didn't completely abandon him, either out of respect for what they'd shared, or possibly out of concern for her children.
 Once it became apparent that the Earth and Sun were through with each other, the Moon began to court her.
 Doomed to touch only briefly during the rare solar eclipses, they nevertheless became beloved, one to the other.
 The greatest sign of the Moon's devotion to the Sun came about when he sent his children down to the Earth to watch over and protect the sunborn, or dayborn as they are most often called."
 Alec's pause was long enough that I think I nodded off, but the sound of his voice once he resumed talking pulled me back awake.
 "Originally there were just two of the moonborn, a pair of brothers called Adjam and Inock.
 Unbeknown to the Moon, the Earth had anticipated his great gesture of love, and sent forth a plague upon the land.

 As always, it was already heating up despite the sun having only barely cleared the mountains.
 It did seem like it wasn't quite as hot though.
 Maybe it was getting late enough in the year to bring the temperatures down slightly.
 It was too much to hope it would actually drop to the low seventies, even when December came around.
 I made it down the lane and then started worrying.

 She's liked Ben for almost as long as I can remember.
 I think it all started when they both ended up at the school nurse together with broken bones due to 'falling down the stairs.'"
 I felt a shiver course through me at the thought of what Rachel was implying.
 Watching Jasmin twirl through moves that seemed to be a modification of East Coast Swing, it was hard to believe anyone so self-possessed could've had that kind of childhood.
 I thought about asking for more details, but it felt wrong, like reading someone else's e-mail.
 Besides, I was pretty sure Rachel would tell me it was Jasmin's story, and I'd just have to go to her with my questions.

Maybe that was why he’d truly brought me here, a much-needed vacation from the duties of council, the task of being a watcher.
 They’d never know, as long as he got me back soon.
 When we reached the lake, the horses stopped and in the quiet shadow of this dreamlike encounter, I forgot I was riding.
 The mountains and lake were almost too much to take in; none of it seemed real.
 This time, Chevelle was next to me before Steed had the chance.
 As my horse knelt, he held out his hand and I stepped down beside him.
 The three stallions followed Steed to a nearby tree where he fed them small green-skinned apples from its branches.
 I glanced back to Chevelle.
 He was watching me.
 I wanted to ask if this was where he was from, but was afraid to set off any conversation that might end with me being hauled back to council that much quicker.

8.Low-input sustainable agriculture.
 While we have argued against pressure on food-deficit developing countries to reduce their comparatively low-level usage of mineral fertilizers and chemical pesticides, empirical studies sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences and the Department of Agriculture in the USA found strong evidence, long resisted by scientists and commercial farmers in the West, that chemical-free farming can be as productive and cost-effective as chemical-based methods.
 Industrial countries that offer subsidies to encourage chemical usage should modify their policies to provide active incentives for the use of chemical-free methods instead.
 During the last ten years, Indonesia has succeeded in bringing down the consumption of chemical pesticides without adversely affecting grain production through the nationwide adoption of integrated pest management systems for food crop protection.
 India has launched a massive national training programme to popularize bio logical methods of pest control, which can reduce the consumption and cost of chemical pesticides by 50 to 75 per cent.
 Public education programmes of this type are needed at the national and international level to disseminate information about chemical-free methods to producers and to educate consumers in developed and developing countries about both the health and environmental benefits of organically grown produce.
 9.Inland aquaculture.
 Depletion of deep sea fishery resources has resulted in a significant decline in world harvests from the sea.
 Proven technology is available for substantially replacing sea-grown fish with fresh or salt water pond-grown varieties.
 The new intensive and semi-intensive methods of cultivation can generate yields 10 to 100 times higher than traditional extensive methods.

 And I was like, I throw my hands up, just let me record and keep me away from the jackals, you know?
 But, well, eventually, I had to get Pete.
 Pete was Jim Dickinson’s friend.
 Jim’s a pure soul, a force for good, the Wise Man of the Forest, you know?
 He told me once, “Watch out for that shithead, Hudson.
 Just be careful.”  And then he said (laughs), “But, damn, isn’t that Kim a piece of work?” (laughs)

“Great,” Seth hissed under his breath.
 “Company for us.” “Whoo…” I mumbled.
 He rolled his eyes and shifted his gaze back to the monsters.
 “Where are they going?” “Uh, we follow them,” I said.
 “I think.” “Yup, we just follow a bunch of monsters that would like to smash us to pulp and serve us for dinner,” Seth said and started to slide down the side of the hill.
 “Brilliant idea.” I followed him down, feeling the grass and dirt scrape the bottom of my leg.
 My pants started to scrunch up causing this slide to be very annoying.
 I decided to ignore it because I had my bow in my hands and had more important things to worry about.
 We crouched behind a rock and watched the group walk off.
 Seth started to stand up and signaled me to wait for him.

Silt and cold water sprayed my face as we ran.
 I wondered if this was what it felt like to fly like the fairies.
 We followed the creek until it turned west and we kept north, slowing to a walk.
 I tried to catch my breath.
 Steed was watching me, smiling appreciatively, and I realized I was wearing a huge grin.
 And about three pounds of mud.
 The slower pace gave me time to take everything in.
 The ground had leveled off again, clearing to open meadows of low grass and a few scattered trees.
 Large gray rocks dotted the landscape.
 There was a haziness on the horizon but as we rode it began to clear, revealing a mammoth lake ahead.

She was probably of the blood and strong.
 She had her brown hair woven into a tight braid and wore well fitting chain and leather armor.
 Her sword and shield seemed to be of excellent quality.
 Rodregas tried to get a good hold on his shield.
 It was battered and not looking good.
 The top of its handle was loose.
 His sword was possibly worse with chips and a crack starting high up.
 As the two circled each other, Rodregas’ realized that his first impression, that she was of the blood was clearly true.
 She was both quicker and stronger than a normal human.
 She was also highly skilled, and while not as physically gifted as Rodregas, she was powerful.

I rolled on my side toward her, dimly irritated she’d poisoned me again.
 Though it was much less severe this time.
 I was simply enveloped in tranquility.
 “Ruby…” Her curls had tumbled back and my complaint fell short as I was distracted by her ears.
 “Hmm?” she answered.
 I reached up to feel my own ears as I considered hers.
 I had always hidden mine behind hair, never braiding it back or putting it up to expose them.
 Not that I could have pulled off the intricate braiding and designs of the other elves.
 But my ears were clearly more rounded than everyone else’s, almost blunt.
 Ruby’s were different, too.

 Jim – Neither do I, but still, it would have been funny to see.
 Art – Son, seeing large naked butt being framed by a loincloth usually doesn’t classify as fun.
 Jim – Tell that to millions of Japanese people.
 Art – You see that is completely cultural.
 In our county it is considered unusual to enjoy watching two very fat men in loincloths grapple with one another.

 He squeezed her closer.
 "You know me.

 You've spent more time with me than you spent with your fiancé in a month--" "Three months."
 "--and you have a certain right to feel possessive."
 He kissed the top of her head.
 "We'll leave it at that for now, OK?"
 "OK." After a few moments, he raised his head and pulled away slightly.
 When she looked up at him, so beautiful and trusting and fragile, he bent his head to kiss her.

 He was desperate.
 He knew now that he could keep her here, but how could he do that when she wanted so much to go home?
 He ordered Chinese, and Marie came down just after it arrived.

Emily and Jason watched us enter and I swallowed nervously.
 Seth gave me a small nod, signaling me to start telling them about my dream.
 “Listen guys, I had a dream,” I said and repeated my dream again, minus the part about Seth.
 Emily and Jason listened to every word I said.
 When I got to the part about Kojas, Emily's mouth made a small O and Jason's eyes widened.
 My voice shook as I recalled the dwarf's dead body.
 “That's awful!” Emily said, her voice shaking.
 She hopped over and gave me a small embrace.
 “I'm sorry you had to see that.” “Uh...thanks Emily,” I said and allowed myself to be hugged.
 She bounced back over to Jason's side and waited for me to continue but there was nothing else to say.

The bull got madder.
 “If you’re gonna fight me, fight me!” he yelled.
 He ignored several strikes, accepting the cuts so he could close the distance between him and his opponent.
 The sound of steel was quick and brutal, but after the humiliation against Dieredon, Harruq felt as if his opponent moved through sand.
 At the end of three seconds, both of his blades had found flesh.
 The guard fell at his feet, bleeding from a severed arm and a gutted belly.
 Soaked in blood, Harruq turned to the remaining guards and bellowed like the mad beast he was.
 The remaining two facing him were trained well.
 They held firm when Harruq charged, and stayed close together.
 Because of this, they managed to survive the initial onslaught.

As the sword punched through the enchanted leather, the half-orc cut his adversary’s throat, using that same swing to parry the other attack away.
 The remaining elf swore as his eyes grew red and watery.
 He backed away from the half-orc, his sword held defensively before him.
 “What demon magic is this?” he asked.
 “Mine,” said Qurrah.
 And then blood poured out from the face of the lone elf.
 The eyeballs hit the ground before the dead body did.

 The great Celestial Lion was on the hunt and when he found his prey, there would be a battle to shake all the realms.
 As the roar faded in the heavens, a new Knight Captain, a chosen Champion of a Goddess, stood in the great Cathedral of the Heavens.
 He heard the roar because it was his.
 The other hunters in his pride were at his side and ready.
 It was time to start the hunt.

 Grey waited.
 “Well, should I let him in?” Chevelle nodded once and Grey left as quickly as he’d entered.
 And then I realized he’d walked through a door.
 I glanced around, confused about where I was.
 Gray stone walls surrounded us, but I’d been staring at an open sky, nothing but the cloak between my prone form and the cold earth.
 “Where are we?” “Fort Stone,” Steed answered.
 I snickered and Chevelle’s irritation resurfaced.
 I didn’t know if it was for me or Steed.
 “Fort Stone?” I asked anyway.

It was apparently a very honorable thing, though she never seemed proud.
 Just off the living area was the study, larger than the front room, stuffed full of documents and lit by a pair of dim oil lanterns.
 Dust covered the decrepit scrolls and books lining the walls, but aside from a well-used worktable, the room was clean.
 Settling onto my usual stool, I leaned forward, elbows on the carved edge of the table to prop my head up for the monotonous hours to come.
 It was hard to say how long I sat so, looking down on a huge volume entitled The Great Elves of Varkenshire, pretending to read.
 But my eyes had wandered from the page to a small thistle where it rested among some other potion ingredients.
 It had begun to extend its leaves.
 I was startled; Junnie was preoccupied with a lengthy scroll across the room and couldn’t have possibly been the source, and I had never made anything grow.
 I concentrated on the thistle then, eyeing each tiny spike.
 I knew the magic, though it had never worked for me before.

I certainly had no clue.
 I heard footsteps and turned to see Emily running over.
 She was wearing a close fitting, long robe.
 It was a stunning deep blue with a trim of gold embroidery.
 She had no weapons dangling from her body were visible from where I was standing.
 “I have pink hair!
 Isn’t it cool?” She spun around so we could take in all of its bubblegum pink color.
 She looked at the bow slung over my shoulder and Seth’s gleaming sword.
 “Hey, I don’t have anything cool and deadly.

American foreign policy toward the USSR in the 1980s was certainly influenced by the fact that, as recently as 1988, more than 50 per cent of Americans believed the Soviets fought against the United States in the Second World War.
 The irrational alarm which economists sounded in the late 1970s about the impact of inflation on the poor in the US overshad owed compelling evidence published by a leading economic institution that poorer Americans were actually better off and it was primarily the rich who were less advantaged by the price rise.
 The importance of continuous investment in training is not fully understood by all but the most advanced corporations.
 There is considerable scope for increasing awareness in areas such as self-employment opportunities, the linkage between education and career development, management practices, and foreign trade opportunities.
 Ignorance and superstition concerning drugs, crime, ethnic and race relations, the environment, health, education, child care, and the life of the elderly demoralize the population and make effective socialaction difficult in these areas.
 These problems can be minimized by educating the public to understand the changes taking place and to adopt appropriate new behaviours.
 Raising awareness internationally
 Public opinion is an even more important determinant at the international level, since the authority of global institutions is still quite limited.
 Rising ethnic and nationalistic sentiments threaten the integrity of states and impede progress toward regional cooperation and global governance in many countries, because their populations lack reliable information regarding the enormous costs of political and economic fragmentation.
 The global debate over the Uruguay Round of GATT has been obscured by lack of clear information regarding its impact on the countries involved.

There was a stereo system off in one corner, hooked up to a laptop and some kind of portable music player.
 I had to look around the room twice before I finally spotted the speakers to the system.
 They were built into the walls and ceiling, and based on their number and varying sizes I had a sneaking suspicion they'd produce nearly as much volume as the monsters professional DJs brought to dances.
 Based on the amount of money involved in setting up such a system in the first place, they probably cranked all that out without even the slightest hint of distortion.
 As impressive as the stereo no doubt was, it was all of those shelves filled with books that finally pulled me off of the bed and onto the incredibly lush, maroon carpet.
 Emerson, Ayn Rand, Shakespeare, and Tolstoy were all present.
 Whoever lived here was either incredibly well read, or a complete poser who bought books just for show.
 Almost scared to find out which it was, I reached over and pulled out the copy of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, and opened it up to find a well-cared-for book that'd still obviously been read several times.
 I carefully slid the book back into its spot and then noticed the faintest glimmer of light coming from an open doorway off to my right.
 It was an art gallery.

“What I don’t get,” Jason said, “is how the arrow managed to stay in perfect shape when the ground collapsed.
 The arrow should be broken and not sticking out of the ground a few feet away.” “Maybe she shot it after,” Emily suggested, because that meant that she was alive.
 Jason rubbed his eyes.
 “I guess that’s a possibility.
 Jazell and Seth were always too stubborn to die anyway.” He stopped pacing.
 “But why would she shoot it up here?” “Maybe she wanted to show us that she was alive,” Emily said.
 “A sign,” Jason muttered and snapped his fingers.
 “That’s it!
 Jazell likes to leave clues, check the arrow.” Emily turned the arrow and saw a sloppy line drawn through two squiggly circles.
 She squinted closer and saw that Jazell had tried to make the line some sort of sword but epically failed.

When I woke late the next morning, I was covered in sweat.
 My head spun as I stood, but I steadied myself and moved to the basin to splash my face.
 As I looked in the mirror at my pallid complexion, my features twisted in horror.
 Understanding came suddenly and would not be denied.
 I scoffed at myself humorlessly as my words taunted me—just harmless fun… what could it hurt?
 For half a second, I wanted to scream.
 And then my hands found their way to my stomach and rested there.
 I drew in a sharp intake of breath.
 I hadn’t noticed I had gotten so deeply involved in the story.
 I needed to rest, to finish my recovery and break the bonds.

 “Elves came and attacked.

I am tucked away in a remote parking space at a retail shopping center.
 No one would normally park this far from the grocery store, which anchors an array of businesses, at least not this late at night in this sparsely populated lot.
 I know this place well, as this is where my wife and I buy our groceries.
 It is in an upper class neighborhood serving the wealthy residents who live in their posh homes nearby.
 The front of my truck faces a short decorative fence, which borders a greenbelt area, and I stare across the wetlands that the railing protects.
 As I sit, I think about the circumstances in my life that brought me to this spot.
 I am alert to my surroundings but distracted by my thoughts.
 The fingers on my left hand slowly stroke my bottom lip and then downward across my graying goatee.
 It is eerily quiet but my mind pounds with the noise in my head.
 My attention should be entirely on the task at hand and not the events in my life that lead me here, but my mind hiccoughs.

After years of sparring with a two hundred pound Greek, I was pretty tough myself.
 We would host evening boxing matches in the living room of the house I rented with my friends.
 We had no furniture in that room.
 A boxing match would start with one person calling out another person to fight.
 You could decline but you would endure the collective shaming of the crowd.
 Several sets of boxing gloves were available and once both fighters had their gloves on, the games would begin.
 Cowering in a corner was never a good strategy as the crowd only pushed you back to the center.
 The room erupted when the action was good and the fights were a scrappy version of actual boxing.
 The fight was over when you surrendered or you were knocked out.
 I fought many times and I do not remember ever losing.

 In a massive voice, he shouted to the mulling throngs.
 “The royal guard is in need of able-bodied men to help rebuild the walls of the city,” he shouted.
 “The work will be hard, but we offer a threepence of copper a day.

 He repeated the message three more times and then wandered back north.

 Tom was coming over for dinner tonight.
 She'd talk him into taking her to a speakeasy this weekend.
 Everything was back to normal.
 But that thought didn't erase the hollow spot in her heart.
 Today would be the first day in more than five weeks that she wouldn't see Rick.
 As much as she was looking forward to seeing Tom, that wasn't the same as knowing Rick would be home at 5:30, would kiss her and ask how her day had been, would hover around her as she made dinner.
 She just needed to get used to her life again, she told herself as she got dressed.
 She was where she belonged.

Our group glided up to the covered pavilion, surrounded in a pocket of silence as the rest of the crowd turned to see who'd just arrived.
 Alec produced tickets for all of us from a pocket somewhere while I was still taking in the sheer number of lights that'd been assembled for the occasion.
 The decorations inside the pavilion were amazing.
 Swathes of silk gave the open-air building an ethereal feel, while candles and other light sources created a soft illumination.
 I didn't have to possess preternatural hearing to catch whispers about the city having received a very large, very anonymous donation just a few days before.
 The committee had obviously chosen to spend it on decorations.
 My newfound height put me closer to Alec's ear.
 I only had to tug on his arm a little bit to get him down to where I could whisper to him.
 "That was you, wasn't it?"
 "What if it was?"

It was Maggie’s Place, half tavern and half orphanage.
 Maggie enjoyed the free labor and the ability to rant and slap her orphan workers without fear of reprisal while still maintaining the image of a heart of gold to her regulars.
 The tavern filled the first floor, while the orphanage and a few modest rooms for rent composed the second.
 Harruq stepped into the alley beside the tavern and looked up.
 A window.
 Perfect.
 As he searched for a way to scale the wall, he saw a drunken man watching him.
 “Get lost,” Harruq growled.
 The man obliged, taking his bottle of ale and running.

 He pointed into the darkness.

 “He returns.”
 Robed in black, the figure approached unseen by the guards.
 He lifted his hands, which shone a pallid white in the fading moonlight.
 So very slowly their color faded, from white, to gray, to nothing, a darkness surrounding and hiding them.

Rodregas had heard from the other guards that the cats were in heat, and as Ravenhurr had hoped, a Celestial Lion had sensed their presence while the lion was out during the full moon with the Wilde Hunt, and the great lion had spent the last few nights doing his best to impregnate both of the female beasts.
 The whole keep could hear the wild rutting going on.
 Ravenhurr then had goats released on the roof and the Celestial Lion had gorged himself on them when he had finished rutting.
 The well-satisfied beast lay limp, sleeping, confident in his celestial power, and oblivious to his surroundings.
 He lied unbound, as required by the ceremony.
 Rodregas assumed some subtle magic had been used to influence the beast to sleep in just the right spot.
 The unlikely success of having an actual celestial animal as part of the ceremony had put Ravenhurr into an unusually good mood.
 Using one of the Dire Cats in the ceremony would have been good, but an actual Celestial animal would provide much more power.
 Rodregas’ hands clutched into a fist at his side as he could not help thinking that the last thing the world needed was for Ravenhurr, or any of the Immortalists, to acquire more power.
 Rodregas knew there was almost no opposition to the Immortalist left, but futile as it would probably be Rodregas could no longer go along with their immoral acts.

And with Zoë on her way, I found myself noticing people on sidewalks or in restaurants, imagining their lives and sending them good wishes, sometimes prayers.
 More often than before, I noticed hummingbirds, horizons, occotillos.
 Spring was the most glorious in years.
 I was feeling more all the time.
 In 1945, the year I was born, my grandma, Mary Durham Garfield, wrote this poem:
 LIVING MONUMENTS Far rather would I pass away And leave a noble son of mine Whom I had taught to love the fine, The just and honest, in his day To serve the world with courage bold, Than have my life on granite told.
 I’d rather feel when death is near That in my children I shall live.
 No monument of stone can give Me greater glory, year by year, Than sons and daughters going on In truth and honor, when I’m gone.
 Who leaves a noble son on earth, A noble daughter, sweet and pure, Has monuments that long endure.
 No shaft can give her greater worth.

Entranced by Marie's beautiful hazel eyes, Rick drew her close and bent his head to kiss her.
 Seconds later, he was startled by a giggle that interrupted their kiss.
 "What's so funny?"
 he demanded.
 "It works!"
 "What works?"
 "I thought about kissing you while I was looking at you, and you kissed me!"
 He shook his head.
 "So you were experimenting.
 You didn't really want to kiss me--you just wanted to see if you could get me to do it."

So we’re having pancakes and bacon and eggs and juice.” “Mmm—that sounds great.
 And it smells even better.”  She sat down, poured syrup on her pancakes, and dug in.
 “Delicious,” she said, swallowing.
 “Thanks.
 I thought we’d go to the grocery store after breakfast and get some more eggs and some milk and a few other things.” “OK.
 And then take a nap.” He smiled.
 “You’re feeling what we call ‘jet lag.’  Your body got used to California time, and it thinks it’s 8:00 in the morning instead of 11:00.” “Really?
 When do I catch up?” “You’ll probably be back to normal by tomorrow.” It was such a beautiful day that she almost asked him if they could go to the shore.
 But she was still a little sleepy, and she was sure he was too.
 It would be nice just to lie around all day napping and watching TV.

Salvation took the woman’s life, Condemnation the man’s.
 The two bodies collapsed, their lifeless limbs entangled.
 Not far ahead of them, a woman ran in only her shift, a child clutched to her breast.
 “Why do you flee?” Harruq roared when her crying eyes glanced back at him.
 “This life is pain, suffering!
 I’m here to end it, end it all!”
 The woman ran faster and her child cried louder.
 It didn’t matter.
 Harruq rammed her with his shoulder.
 To protect her child, the woman rolled so that her side took the brunt of the fall.

Ruby caught my arm to steady me.
 Her smile was strained as she handed me a drink of water.
 Chevelle was near the entrance of the stone room with Anvil and Grey.
 They appeared to be preparing to leave.
 “What’s going on?” I asked.
 “Nothing to worry about,” Ruby assured me.
 “Just a hunting trip.” I was still muddled, but I knew it wouldn’t take three of them to hunt.
 And then I remembered the bits of conversation I’d heard when I woke.
 “Someone’s missing?” I took stock.
 I’d seen everyone but Rhys and Rider now.

It was only a sapling, but the second and third tree followed.
 “You look like you’ll need shelter, sunshine,” he explained.
 I stared in disbelief as the trees split to form a low lean-to.
 He shot me another wink; I couldn’t be sure he was kidding.
 The tearing and popping noises ceased, and I examined his creation.
 Quite impressive really.
 He didn’t even seem to be watching, let alone concentrating.
 And no blessings on it, no thanks to Mother Earth.
 It seemed he was just enjoying himself, not being responsible to the magic.
 Magic that I needed.

I let my beast bubble up from the corner of my being where I usually kept it chained.
 Between one moment and the next, I went from running on four legs to two.
 As my transformation ended, a six-foot tower of muscle and claws sprang from the shadows.
 I ducked Vincent's first blow and retaliated with a gash that opened one side of his chest nearly down to the bone.
 A dark-furred form leaped at Jasmin, but the other wolf mistimed the spring.
 Most of the other pack didn't appreciate just how nimble she was.
 Jasmin dodged to one side and then the two of them were circling, looking for an opening.
 Vincent, the other hybrid, attacked with the strength and fury that'd earned him the position of second in his pack, but he hadn't been expecting to face me in this form.
 As a wolf I weighed in at a solid two hundred pounds, but would've still given up more than a hundred pounds to him.
 Now I had at least six inches and seventy-five pounds on my side of the equation, and he was the one pressed onto the defensive as the fight progressed.

So I basically made the conclusion that she wasn’t human.
 “Uh okay…” I said slowly.
 She giggled, “Wow I never thought I’d scare a bunch of half-lings but I guess I did.” “You didn’t scare me,” Jason said quickly.
 “Yeah okay, Jason,” Emily said sarcastically.
 I sat up and leaned on Seth because I would fall if I didn’t, and Emily and Jason were too busy giving each other looks to help me.
 “What and who are you?” I stared at her.
 She rolled her eyes, “A light pixie, duh.” I blinked, “A light pixie?” “Yes, a light pixie.
 Are you deaf?” she retorted.
 “Uh, no, I’m not.
 I don’t know what a light pixie is or why you saved my life, but thank you” I said, trying not to snap back.

It was an odd sight for me as I watched these officers chow down their burgers and sip on their drinks reminiscing about the drug deal they just finished.
 Just another day at the office, I guess.
 In a moment, my crack-berry starts to blow up with one call after the next from Ashley, wanting to know when we are doing this deal.
 I must keep buying time with excuses, now nearing a two-hour delay waiting for the cops to come from the other bust.
 It is looking like this deal is not going to happen either.
 I answer some of the calls and ignore others as I am instructed to do by Officer White.
 I whisper in one call as if I can’t talk because I am still stuck at home with my wife and cannot talk freely.
 I reassure Ashley that I will meet her as soon as I can get out.
 I think of my wife and son at home wondering why I haven’t called; is it over?
 Am I dead?

I mean, I could have left.
 There were no bars or anything.
 But, I had no will, I had no good reason to do anything.
 Lorelei would just sit with me and we’d talk about small things, you know, what it was like outside, what she was reading, some painting she was doing.
 Almost anything but me getting back to the music.
 See, Lor, instinctively knew that was the sticking point, that me making music again was the key, but, also my deepest fear—that I’d lost it all.
 That I’d never write another meaningful song.
 I’d rather not say which hospital this was.
 Just because of, you know, the privacy thing.
 I think I’m supposed to be discrete about that.

When addicts become so addicted that they cannot afford the quantity of Oxy they need to satisfy their cravings, as the appetite exceeds the budget, it is time for the next phase of this vicious cycle.
 Addicts will do what they said they would never do.
 Steal money.
 Sell their bodies to strangers.
 Encourage their girlfriend or wife to sell her body.
 Anything to get the cash they desperately need to feed the demon that owns them.
 The most extreme way to increase Oxy’s effect is to reduce the powder to a liquid, draw it into a syringe, and shoot it into their veins, warming them from the inside out.
 Sound familiar?
 There is nothing more glamorous about this drug than heroin.
 The same addiction, the same diseases, the same low-down disgusting lying homeless in the alley and piss your pants drug—Oxy is essentially synthetic heroin.

The half-orc halted, turned, and sat back down.
 His face was still beet red but the elf paid it no mind.
 “Alright,” Harruq grumbled.
 “No interrupting, and no saying a thing.

 Don’t even know why I’m telling you this.”
 “Because you must,” she said, a bit of her stubbornness returning.
 “Because I need to know.”
 The half-orc nodded.
 He began his story.

I started to share her grin, but before I could, Chevelle was in front of us, his horse blocking my way.
 I was almost thrown from my saddle when we stopped to avoid running into him.
 He was angry again.
 “Frey.” “What?” “Do you remember the last time you used a spell?” I recalled the smell of burning flesh as the maps cut into my palms.
 “Yes,” I muttered, defeated.
 The look he gave Ruby was clear.
 There would be no magic study for me.
 But I did know she had it.

The spectators in this fight were divided into two groups, with a fairly significant space between them.
 The rest of the students seemed to be reluctant to fill that gap in.
 It wasn't until Britney pulled me closer that I understood why.
 Brandon stood surrounded by his friends on one side of the circle, with Alec and a smaller group standing opposite them.
 The tension in the room was like the air before a lightning strike, charged and unpredictable, a living organism on the point of materializing out of thin air and attacking anything surrounding it.
 Taking in the two groups, I was amazed at the disparity before my eyes.
 The kids behind Brandon were half again as many as the gathering behind Alec, and they were eager for the confrontation, watching with excited eyes, and large smiles.
 Alec's company on the other hand awaited the coming fight with calm exteriors and a sense they were bowing before the inevitable conflict without conceding anything to their opponents.
 They were fewer in number, but the men were larger than anyone other than Alec or Brandon, and I somehow knew even the girls were dangerous.
 With a sudden start I realized the confrontation wasn't between Brandon and Alec as I'd originally thought.

It's addictive, subtly, so subtly most humans never even realize what is happening to them.
 I've seen what it's done to my mother.
 How can I say I love you if I turn around and do the same thing to you?"
 For a second I couldn't even think.
 He'd just used the 'L-word', and my heart felt like it was tearing itself apart inside my chest.
 In the subtle shadings we girls used to measure commitment, it wasn't as good as if he'd come right out and said, 'I love you Adriana Paige', but it was still pretty good, and it was a complete first for me.
 Once I made it past the second part of his statement, I was able to start considering the first part of what he'd said.
 It was horrifying and amazing all at once, and it made complete sense.
 His mom was living in memories because the real world was just a pale shadow of her life with his father.
 Alec seemed to take my silence as condemnation, or possibly just agreement with his self-condemnation.

I heard someone in the front room and knew I had read through the night again.
 I hurriedly slipped the book into my pack and pretended to sleep.
 Ruby was waking me minutes later to head out to the ridge.
 Chapter Fourteen Traveling
 The group was waiting for us when we crossed over the ridge, down to the site where we had spent so many days and nights.
 If I hadn’t been so exhausted from lack of sleep, I would have probably been nervous.
 As it was, I blindly followed Ruby as we gathered and eventually mounted to leave.
 Chevelle, Steed, and I were back on our mounts from the earlier leg of the journey.
 Ruby, Grey, and Anvil each rode their own black horses, though Anvil’s was larger—I assumed to accommodate his massive frame—and Ruby’s was decorated, tendrils of red and gold in his mane.
 Though it wasn’t unusual, I didn’t see Rhys and Rider or the wolves.

 “That where you two live?”
 “Yes.”
 “Fine,” the leader said.
 “Go and get whatever the abyss you can carry.”
 Harruq climbed into the shed, throwing Qurrah a worried look before he did.
 When he came out holding his sheathed swords to his chest, the guards tensed, readying their weapons.
 “Drop those right now,” they ordered him.
 Harruq clutched them tight, and the look on his face was clear.
 He would fight, and die, before he gave them up.

If you say it won't happen, it won't.” “I hope you're right,” he said.
 “Me too.” The mood was perfect.
 I saw Seth relax a little and the look on his face was more like himself.
 I was perfectly happy with the way everything was right now until I saw the small outline of a toad dwarf nearby.
 “Uh Seth I don't think this is the best time to mention this but I think we have company.” I pointed to the shape.
 He swore under his breath, and we both entered the dwarf's world together.
 Sure enough, it was a dwarf but there was something strangely different about this particular dwarf.
 He just walked toward us as if he wasn't afraid that I might put an arrow through his head.
 Just as I was about to release my arrow, the dwarf cried, “Please stop!” I don’t know why I listened to him but I didn’t pull the string.
 The dwarf was acting different than the others; its pudgy eyes were filled with fear at the sight of my arrow.

Rodregas had learned that Doi’van thought before speaking.
 “I am not sure.
 I like learning magic, though I am just beginning.
 I would think that I would take on a minor sigil or two.
 I am a great warrior, but I like to learn new things and I would like to have sufficient magic to be able to learn spells.” Rodregas nodded.
 Doi’van’s response would have surprised him before, but he had learned much of the thoughtful Hellborn in their time together.
 When one looked at him and how powerfully built he was, it was incredible to imagine what he could do on the battlefield with a greater sigil added to his power.
 He would be a true daemon on the battlefield.
 But while Doi’van loved his strength, he also loved his intelligence.
 In comparison, Rodregas was less interested in exploring learning as he was about what he could do as a warrior and carrying out his duty.

It was based on Einstein's theory of relativity.
 These wormholes Marie had mentioned were passages formed around black holes, which were collapsed stars.
 And it was all based on the assumption that something besides light could travel at the speed of light.
 In one small paragraph he found that the entire article was theory upon theory: no one had ever found a black hole or a wormhole or anything that could travel faster than the speed of light.
 "You didn't miss anything," Rick told Marie, setting the article aside.
 "Scientists think that it would be possible to travel through time by going through these wormholes the author mentions, but it's all theory.
 Nobody has ever discovered a wormhole, and none of this stuff has ever been proven."
 Marie sighed.
 "This book isn't hard to follow, but I'm rather skeptical.

Another car approaches and it is white, but I cannot tell the make of the vehicle.
 As it passes, I check it out and see that it is a woman with two small children.
 She is handing a baby bottle towards a car seat in the back.

Still, more than 800 million people spread throughout the developing world lack sufficient and secure access to nutritious food and clean drinking water.
 Between 1990 and 2000, malnutrition declined from 21 per cent to 18 per cent of the population of developing countries, but it actually increased marginally among the least developed nations, particularly in Africa.
 Incidence of malnutrition among children under five years of age remains severe in both Africa and South Asia.
 But the problem is more complex than these numbers suggest.
 Although India is considered a food surplus state, it is home to the largest number of undernourished people in the world and access to a balanced diet and clean drinking water is far below the basic requirements for sound health.
 Projections indicate that over the next decade growth of the world’s food supply will be adequate to meet the needs of all human beings.
 The UN Millennium Development Goal of halving the number of human beings suffering from hunger and malnutrition between 1990 and 2015 is highly commendable, yet achieving it would still leave an unconscionably large number of people without adequate food.
 More can and must be done in the next decade to eradicate the scourge of hunger.
 The problem of water scarcity is even more pervasive and challenging.
 Studies indicate that by 2015 more than half the world’s population – mostly in Africa, the Middle East, South Asia and Northern China – will be living in countries that are ‘water-stressed’.

The challenge and the opportunity now presented is to make conscious the previously unconscious process of development, to accelerate it, and to convert the revolution of rising social expectations into a positive energizing movement of the entire global society.
 This is the all-powerful driving force that has so radically transformed the social landscape during this ‘century of the common man’.
 This is the ultimate ‘rationale’ behind the inevitable claim of the poor everywhere that will be made with ever-growing insistence and impatience until it is finally granted – as the birthright of every human being – freedom, food, education, employment, prosperity and fulfilment for all.
 Perspectives for the New Millennium
 The individual effect, complex linkages, mutually supportive interactions and consequent cumulative impact of these two revolutions and the nine other factors propelling global change are incalculable.
 They make this a rare moment in history for a quantum leap forward, which many have dreamed about but few believed achievable.
 Seizing this opportunity requires, most importantly of all, a change in awareness, attitude and perspective.
 Several ideas will be of abiding value in our endeavour to make the most of this rare moment.
 Our present problems and future potentials can only be understood when viewed from a wider historical perspective that avoids getting lost in the media-driven drama and intensity of momentary crisis and short-term trends.
 As recent global action to protect the environment amply demonstrates, public awareness and understanding are growing too rapidly and becoming too important in global affairs for us to rely on the present positions of governments or current public sentiment as gauges of what may be achieved in the near future.

You should be buckled in."
 I expected her to argue with him.
 No girl on the planet liked it when her older brother sided with her friends against her, but Rachel just frowned a little before scooting back so she could do up her seatbelt.
 Was she really that scared of him?
 I stole a glance at him out of the corner of my eye.
 He didn't look threatening, well, at least no more so than usual.
 Anyone with that many muscles was at least a little threatening.
 But he was just sitting there casually, driving along, seemingly without a care in the world.
 In fact, he wasn't buckled in either.
 "Isn't that a bit hypocritical?

“I know,” stated the Hellborn in a voice that was so deep it was like stones grinding.
 “But still, I would travel with you.” Again he made the statement and showed no interest in explaining his action.
 “Actually,” added Imeralda shaking her long curly hair behind her as if to clear the way for her decision, “I was thinking the same thing.
 I am not safe from the Guild anyhow.
 My natural magical talent is very strong, and until I am better skilled in it, I am very vulnerable,” she stated “And frankly, while Audrian, Brit and Geor are very brave to let me travel with them, I fear that I put their lives in danger.
 You, on the other hand, are in more danger than I am, and should be even more motivated to stay out of the sight of the Guild.” After saying the little speech that she had clearly been practicing in her head, she added, “Joining you makes sense.” Rodregas hesitated, but she had an excellent point, and of course turning away such a beautiful young woman was a difficult thing to do.
 She did have a point and he did have a reasonably safe place to hide that he had been heading toward.
 So, even if he did head out on a raid of the Immortalists, she should be safe enough.
 The human men would be of least interest to the Guild and the easiest to blend in.
 On the other hand, while the Hellborn were feared and disliked, the Immortalists should not be interested in Doi’van.

He was good enough, there was no question of that.
 He’d definitely be able to teach me.
 I started to ask, but fell short.
 I had no idea who this was and I probably shouldn’t let on who I was.
 He noticed my open mouth, blank expression, and sat again, eyeing me questioningly, all humor gone.
 “You seem to be really good at magic,” I offered.
 He chuckled.
 “Is that so?” “Yes, well, I… I need to learn.” “Learn?” The humor was gone again.
 “What do you mean learn?” “I’ve never, well, except for fire, and I need someone to teach me… and you’re…” I waved a hand in his direction.
 His brow rose.

The largest circle held all the others and was made of a glittering white sand-like substance.
 Its diameter had been drawn as large as possible within the limitations of the roof’s edges.
 On the inside were sigils, runes, and small candles set out every few feet.
 Rodregas knew enough of magic to understand that the purpose of this circle was to keep out unwanted magical influences.
 They could interfere with the spell casting inside the circle.
 Also, the circle would hold in any magical forces inside which someone wanted to store or manipulate.
 Inside the large circle were four smaller circles.
 Rodregas’ eyes immediately went to the one on the north side made of blue sand, where inside sigils made of a yellow waxy substance laid a giant lion.
 This was not a normal lion such as those found in the nearby forest, but a giant beast.
 Ravenhurr had been lucky indeed.

 You didn’t think about lifting your leg to get on the horse, you just knew you wanted to climb on and your leg lifted.” Chevelle caught us then, riding up and cutting off Steed’s explanation with a clipped, “This isn’t the time for a magic lesson.” All three horses slowed to a walk as Chevelle shot Steed a glance.
 I could only think of our lessons, of the fire in the clearing.
 It had been so obvious once Chevelle had urged me to control a stronger flame, I guessed because I had been using the power in small doses for so long.
 “What about your hands?” I asked.
 “What do you mean?” Steed said, ignoring Chevelle’s warning glance.
 “Why do you use your hands, if you just think it, I mean?” He laughed.
 “That’s simply a quirk, I guess.

 I shrugged, pretending indifference.
 "How soon will we know if it's really bad or just a little bad?"
 "I don't know.
 Things were already pretty tense.
 That's probably where Alec is right now actually.
 Brandon's people are always skirting around the edge of our territory, but tonight they'll be out in greater numbers than normal.

 “Nothing,” Qurrah said.

 They flung themselves against the surrounding guards.

 Rick pulled her onto his lap and began devouring her mouth.

 Her innocence combined with her confession was a powerful aphrodisiac.
 She was so trusting and yet so passionate, her mouth as hungry as his, her hands caressing and clutching and clawing at his chest and shoulders and neck.
 Hadn't she understood a word he'd said?
 Rick let the embrace go on for as long as he could.
 Then he ended it abruptly, setting her on the sofa and holding himself away from her.
 "Rick," she gasped, reaching for him.

 Warmth flooded my neck, my cheeks, and his gaze followed the flush.

“Sorry,” Harruq muttered.
 He shivered as a skull sailed just above them, its screech turning to chaotic laughter.
 The sound raced up and down his spine, triggering fear no matter how irrational.
 Qurrah watched as if immune to the sound.

 Yet he was unafraid.
 Shame and embarrassment burned in Harruq’s cheeks.
 He towered over his brother, his hands beefy and arms muscular.
 Nothing should scare him.
 He was supposed to be Qurrah’s protector, not the other way around.

I believe it was Sylvia Curtis, when Eric and I talked to her about Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, who convinced me that Holden Caulfield was right to pour most of his wrath on phonies.
 When Olga Savitsky and I considered founding a church, we agreed that above the entrance would hang a sign, “No bullshit allowed.” After all, God is a matter of life and death.
 In Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Robert Pirsig argues that being stuck is the best place for a mechanic (or a problem solver of any sort) to find himself.
 When we’re stuck, we come to the problem free from any preconceptions.
 I mean to test his argument, because I’m stuck on the word “adore.” Here’s how it happened: in the midst of a period of personal, family, and professional turmoil, I picked up The Practice of the Presence of God, by Brother Lawrence, and discovered that simply reading about this fellow from long ago delivers some peace.
 Not perfect peace, but closer than before.
 Close enough so that friends find my apparent serenity in the midst of turmoil worth remarking about.
 Brother Lawrence was a layman who lived and worked, mostly in the kitchen, at a monastery in sixteenth century France.
 I thank God for the book by and about him.
 Still, it leaves me with nagging questions and a suspicion that I may have missed the point.

In the end, it didn't really matter why everyone disliked me.
 Still, only the fact that Alec's pack closed ranks around me kept the situation from becoming unbearable.
 Biology went better than it had since my first day in Sanctuary, largely because Alec seemed to have developed a postdoctorate knowledge of Biology.
 Also he didn't have a single qualm when it came to using that knowledge to deflect questions aimed at me.
 Mrs. Sorenson tried three different times to make me look stupid before finally giving up and getting down to the business of teaching.
 She continued to shoot us nasty looks throughout the class, but I hardly noticed.
 Alec spent the rest of the class time writing questions for me in the margins of my notebook.
 By the time I'd described my grandparents, kindergarten teacher, and top three most embarrassing moments, I wanted to get a chance to ask some questions of my own, but he just shook his head and passed me my notebook back with a new set of quickly-jotted queries.
 The sentences should have been a careless mess based on the speed with which he was writing.
 Instead they turned out more even and carefully constructed than anything I'd ever been able to accomplish.

 He still couldn't believe that this had happened.
 He didn't believe in extraterrestrials, he didn't believe in ghosts, and he certainly didn't believe that people could travel through time.
 But here she was.
 His mind reeled with the implications and unreality of it all.
 And the emotion that permeated his jumbled thoughts was guilt.
 He'd been preoccupied with thoughts of Marie ever since he'd seen her picture.
 Was it possible that his thoughts had somehow brought her here?
 But even if that were true, how could he have known that thinking about someone would cause her to appear?

"I promise not to get in the way.
 In fact if you could just find us a couple of desks in the back corner you'll hardly know we're here."
 The look she shot me was so venomous for a second I thought my heart was going to stop.
 "Ms. Paige has an assigned seat towards the front of the class.
 Based on her scholastic performance to date it would be highly irresponsible of me as an educator to allow her to change seats."
 I was just far enough off to the side to watch as Alec's eyes very slowly and pointedly drifted down to stare at the note in her hands.
 For a second I wasn't sure she'd gotten the hint, but then those same hands clenched reflexively, nearly tearing the note before she caught herself and smoothed it back out.
 "Ms. Bellarose, please move up to Ms. Paige's old seat."
 Alec politely collected his note and led me to our seats.
 Any enjoyment I'd just experienced as a result of seeing one of my least-favorite teachers put in her place quickly soured as she started the class and launched into her usual barrage of questions designed to demonstrate my stupidity.

Instead it was filled with beasts; lions and wolves and the great mythical animals of the Celestial Realm.
 Most of these he recognized as the great totems of the Celestial Realm, each representing great power.
 The great beasts were full-size and, but for their lack of movement, Rodregas would have thought that they must have traveled to the Celestial Realm itself.
 “Oh, my Gods, they look real.
 I thought they would be made of stone like the frog,” said Imeralda.
 Rodregas nodded.
 The beasts looked to be made of flesh and bone, except they all stood perfectly still on short stone pedestals.
 Strangely, the room did not smell of damp stone like the rest of the cathedral, but the air smelled of the outdoors in spring.
 Rodregas’ eyes were drawn to the powerful lion that reared up not far into the gathered animals, and just to the right of the center.
 He walked over to it.

It'd left me feeling very unsatisfied.
 I rolled over and pulled the note out from its hiding place in my dresser.
 I had the words memorized already; the symbol was what I wanted now.
 The note was proof of the existence of our benefactor, but the sigil on the bottom of the page was a clue to his identity.
 It was incredibly intricate and completely different than anything I'd ever seen.
 Once again I traced the sharp edges and smooth swirls with my eyes, marveling at the way it hinted at further complexity lurking just out of sight.
 With a sigh of resignation I hid the note once again and pulled myself out of bed.
 Convinced as I was that Brandon was our benefactor, I no longer felt any qualms about trusting him to come pick me up.
 I waited in the living room until I saw him pull up, and then skipped out to meet him with a smile.
 He reached over and opened my door, but some of the usual casualness was missing from his smile.

It had felt like I was abandoning Cindi by doing so, but just seeing Cindi's half of the twin pendants we'd received two years before had been enough to send me into a tailspin.
 A detached part of me noted that it was just like Mom to have lied about having lost Cindi's.
 She'd known I couldn't handle the reminder of what we'd lost, but she'd been unwilling to give up that link to the past.
 The thought slipped away like sunlight skipping across water a split second before the storm arrived.
 The attack was a bad one.
 I lost more time.
 I must have slept at some point, but the next time I surfaced it was Saturday morning and I was sitting in front of an empty bowl with an unopened box of cereal and a gallon of milk waiting in the wings.

 “Let's just say I know what I'm talking about.

 The four of you were chosen because of your unbreakable bond, but even that can be broken.
 You are strongest when you are together, so don’t let yourselves be separated.” “Wouldn't it be called 'an breakable bond', then?” I asked her.
 She laughed but then grew serious.
 “Be very careful.
 We all know that we picked the right four, but it would be a shame if something happened to all of you before you could complete your goal.” That got my attention.

 So, on long trips in my old Toyota I listen to hymns, gospel music and such.
 As I set off on this trip, half book promotion tour and half vacation, I’m wrestling with Brother Lawrence and the question, why don’t I adore God?
 I plan to drive up the West Coast, San Diego to Seattle, and stop over with Cliff Torrey in Atascadero and Bob Williams in Portland.

 It is this: we are not cynical.
 We do not deny our left arms, our spiritual sides.

Trying to be as casual as possible, I looked into the art room as I hobbled by, but they'd rearranged their stations, and someone's easel was in the way now.
 The sprained ankle had slowed me down enough that there was no way I was going to make it back to my locker before the bell rang.
 Still, I tried to be gracious when it went off just as I handed Mrs. North the papers.
 Based on the number of classrooms on the second floor, and the narrowness of the stairs, there was no point in trying to wait the crowd out.
 I gritted my teeth and limped out into the surge of bodies.
 Surprisingly enough, there were more familiar faces than expected.
 As I grabbed the handrail on the right, I noticed Isaac several feet ahead of me.
 Of course, it's hard to miss someone nearly six feet tall and almost as well-muscled as Alec.

 If Isaac had been the one close enough to reach out and touch, I probably would've tried to get his attention and said hi.

The glow of the spirit faded.
 It looked back and forth, shaking and moaning.
 “You cannot be bastard children of mine,” Ahrqur said, his voice weak and distant.
 “Celestia cannot hate me so.”
 “Celestia has nothing to do with this,” Qurrah said.
 “It is truth.”
 Almost all the spirit’s glow was gone.
 Only hatred and disgust lingered in his eyes.
 “May I be released now, wretched spawn of mine?” Ahrqur asked.
 “Yes.

He would have been an inpatient for over two months by then, and the Narconon program would keep him as long as they needed until he was ready to graduate or until he left on his own.
 We could only hope that Brandon stayed with the program and left only when he had the tools to stay off the dope.
 In the meantime, I handled the balance of Brandon’s court appointments with a power of attorney and I dealt personally with Officer White to have his charges dropped.
 I appeared in court for Brandon in an environment I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy.
 Young and old alike were escorted into the courtroom, shackled at the hands and ankles in their jail issued orange jump suits.
 They shuffled their feet along the ground as they entered the room.
 They looked defeated and unhealthy as the officers who escorted them cuffed each one to a chain that ran beneath the benches as they awaited their hearings or sentencing.
 I imagined my son in their place.
 I wished my son was here to see what could have been.
 The audience in the courtroom was a colorful mixture of society’s misfits and their families.

I calmed down enough to marvel at the amount of other baggage Vincent dragged out of the house, and then any chance I might have had to back out vanished as Brandon picked me up and deposited me on the tailgate of Vincent's truck.
 "Riding in the back, isn't that illegal?"
 The high-maintenance blonde Vincent was helping up next to me rolled her eyes.
 "Please."
 Brandon helped a couple of late arrivals into the pickup, and then closed the tailgate.
 I half thought he was going to ride up front in the crowded cab, but he instead cleared the sides of the truck in a jump that was almost inhumanly graceful.
 He crowded in, close enough I could feel my skin start to tingle with anticipation, and then Vincent started the engine and we were off.
 In what was probably the only display of maturity and common sense I'd ever seen out of Vincent, he didn't tear off down the freeway at eighty miles per hour.
 He was still going plenty fast, but at least the wind wasn't deafening.
 After a few minutes of white-knuckled fear, I was finally able to relax a little, and enjoy the feeling of having Brandon so close while the wind tossed my hair back and forth.

"You're saying that because you're worried for me?
 Not because you really want to go back to him?"
 I shook my head, as confused by his reaction, by how close he'd come to losing control, as I was by my not having felt threatened.
 "No, I want to stay, but how can I knowing it will mean you're going to be fighting to the death?"
 Alec tossed the branch away with a sigh.
 "I've spent years learning control, but sometimes I still forget just how breakable everything around me is.
 If you go back to Brandon, you support his claim that you belong to him, and I'd still be forced to challenge him.
 If I didn't, he would be justified in killing whichever two of my friends he wants."
 "So there's no way you can avoid fighting him?"
 Alec's smile was more bittersweet than normal.

Chevelle was gone.
 “Are you well?” “Ugh.” He snickered.
 “Come on.” He swept me up, planning to carry me.
 My head spun.
 “No.
 Please let me walk.” “You do not tolerate that stuff well.
 You’re going to have to lay off the shimmer.” “It’s not like I chose to take it,” I complained.
 He laughed.
 The cold air helped a little.

 The easiest thing would have been to stay quiet and just let her believe I'd played an integral part of the project, but I didn't like getting credit for something I hadn't done.
 It was the worst kind of lying.

I might be forgiven, but I felt no less corrupt than before.
 Lucky for her, we lost her in the crowd.
 In the car, Cliff and I didn’t mention surrendering.
 We drove to a party, and told nobody about Billy Graham.
 We stayed in the kitchen, drank a couple beers and talked baseball with a few lonely guys.
 A card game started, but poker is no fun if you don’t care who wins.
 The only girls were hanging on their boyfriends.
 So we left.

 You really can let go of me."
 "Maybe, but I'm enjoying holding onto you."
 I forcefully removed his hand as I shook my head.

She would have been lonely and vulnerable when she'd gone back.

 Although he knew it would be torture, he went to his desk and dug out the pages about her.
 He scanned them for the information he wanted.
 Born 1904, daughter of Jefferson Tranton, one brother .

 The pages hadn't changed since the last time he'd read them.
 There was no mention of her life after age 23.

Wave after wave of arrows rained upon them, and those who fell were trampled by the rest, but the masses were not even slowed.
 Harruq pointed past the army to where a long line of men stood in the distance, carrying no light or torch.
 “What are they doing?” he asked.
 Qurrah searched the line, and he saw what he suspected.
 “The necromancer,” he observed, pointing to the black shape hidden underneath robes and a hood.
 “Those alongside him are dead, Harruq.
 They serve only him.”

When he asked for all who would surrender to come to the altar, I stood and followed the auburn haired babe.
 About halfway down, I heard Cliff.
 He came behind me and said, “Are we sure about this?” I didn’t answer, only kept descending into the valley of whatever.
 Dark had fallen.
 Hundreds of us lost souls crowded in front of the portable stage somewhere around the goal line.
 I suspected the others, like me, wanted to get near Billy Graham and his giant companions, for comfort and to borrow some of their power.
 The singing giant led a few thousand folks in a hymn.
 “Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling, calling oh sinner come home, come home, come home, ye who are weary come home…” I mumbled the surrender words I heard someone else say, and waited.
 Cliff had stayed beside me.
 I believe he mumbled too.

How is that possible?"
 Rachel's expression as she tried to understand my question was so surprised it actually managed to lighten the mood.
 "Oh, I forget sometimes how much you don't know.
 I'm normal, and Mom's normal, but everyone else is a shape shifter.
 Human-shape shifter marriages almost never happen, but when they do the kids can go either way.
 Alec became a shape shifter, and I'm just a run-of-the-mill girl without even a single superpower."
 We sat in silence for several seconds as I tried to process how that new piece of information fit in with everything else I already knew.
 The obvious, if somewhat selfish, implication was that maybe it really was possible for someone like Alec to want to be with someone like me.
 There were plenty of other things to think about though.
 "Wow, is that hard?

What more could she do?
 Well, one thing she wasn’t going to do was give up, she determined as she played with the hem of her dress.
 She’d strolled through her garden countless times without walking into 2011, so who knew how many times she’d have to walk in the garden to get back to 1927?
 She wasn’t going to give up.
 Rick, still concerned about Marie, left work at 4:30, making a quick stop to pick up a surprise for her.
 To his dismay, he found her huddled in a corner of the sofa, still wearing her 1927 clothes.
 “Hi, sweetheart,” he greeted her, going to sit beside her.
 “Are you feeling better?” “I’m all right.” “I brought you something.”  He handed her a plastic bag.
 She took it and reached inside.
 “Wow!” she exclaimed as she withdrew the 16-ounce Hershey bar.

The Greek family rumor was that my mother was sitting on a stash of smuggled diamonds and should sell them and repay the loan.
 There were no such diamonds and there was no money.
 Anyone who owed Dino money disappeared into thin air or claimed they had repaid him.
 My mother was also left bearing the responsibility of a huge IRS tax lien and a mountain of bills.
 Mom and 11-year-old Harry were losing everything to the IRS, and it was just a matter of time before they were broke and homeless.
 I went home to help her; after all, I had nowhere else to be.

 Valentine’s Day, 1981, I decided to go to this local pick-up joint with Bill and hang with the rest of the hounds.

There was no sign that a bit of his magic had been used up in the creation of a permanent effect.
 Rodregas sat and watched as Doi’van and then Imeralda undertook the inscription of the minor sigil.
 From Rodregas’ perspective the next two seemed to withstand the pain a lot better than then he had.
 After all three were completed Imeralda used her magic to inscribe Jordaan.
 The healing sigil was the only sigil commonly used by magic users.
 A few were known to use sigils that improved memory or allowed one to store excess magic.
 After the sensation faded Rodregas felt no different than before.
 Rodregas had the feeling that Jordaan would have liked to keep the little frog; it was a powerful tool in the hands of an Elemental Healer like Jordaan, but Rodregas was not willing to give it up, and Jordaan never actually asked.
 The next morning they headed out for the Cathedral of Oravue.

I reach for my waist and pull the wire off before he can help me.
 I hold it out to him, he takes it from me and turns it off, and he says, “We got them.” I am so relieved but that is only one answer to one question and I have many.
 The deal was done and I was so relieved that it was over.
 I then called my wife who was so wound up from the lack of communication over such a long period of time.
 She sobbed uncontrollably as I told her I was unharmed, headed home, the ordeal was over and we busted the drug dealers.
 A hero’s welcome awaited me, as my son was so thankful for what I had done for him.
 As I went to bed that night, my mind would not shut off and the events of that evening replayed in my head over and over again.
 I lay awake for hours wondering what would have happened if the dealer hadn’t run into the cops.
 They both confessed to the drug deal when separately interrogated.
 The officer said they had less than half of the money, which she had attempted to hide in a trash can in the Starbucks’ bathroom, and Steve had a gun, which Ashley admitted they would have used if I didn’t give them the drugs once I discovered they were short on cash.

 I screamed so loud that my ears felt like they were going to pop.
 We plummeted to the ground, falling closer and closer… Oh man, I thought and closed my eyes.
 Don’t look, don’t look, don’t look… “Really!” Seth yelled at the sky.
 “This brings new meaning to ‘things can’t get any worse!’” I gripped furiously to the limp dragon.
 I was falling to my death: so this is how it was going to end.
 I never pictured it this way; I thought I would die a little more heroically, not screaming like a little girl.

 And then they don’t exactly qualify as cliffs with their gentle incline and all.

 Catcher in the Rye she applauded because Holden Caulfield appreciated jazz and was nearly as cynical as herself.

 One Friday night, I arrived just as they were leaving for a jazz club.
 Before climbing into Richard’s car, Sylvia commanded me, “If you brought any liquor, Kenneth, go away.” I agreed and waited until they drove off before scooping a pint of bourbon and a bottle of ginger ale out of my Chevrolet’s trunk.

 Antonil halted at the center of Veldaren where the four main roads of the city interconnected and a large marble fountain towered over all.
 Not bothering to call for silence or attention, he unrolled the scroll and shouted its edict.
 Because of his rank, the troops in attendance, and the overall respect given to the man who had engineered the city’s successful defense only days before, he was quickly given a respectful silence.

 I swallowed hard and forced myself to continue walking, this time determined not to trip.
 Following the path as it wound closer to them, I became excruciatingly aware it was going to split, heading to either the gate or to the library.

 Virden shot me one quick look and stormed into his tree.
 Chevelle remained standing where he was, his back to me.

 It was so real, and she gripped the edge of her seat as she waited to see what would happen after he fell into the water.
 The villain jumped up on the platform to make his bows with the rest of the cast.
 Marie raised wide eyes to Rick's face as they stood to leave.

On the fourteenth and final day, however, Harruq was in an unusually quiet mood.
 His mind refused to stay on the mock combat, and many times a quick jab of Aurelia’s staff cracked his arm or wrist when he should have easily deflected it away.

 Recognizing the importance of agricultural surplus to rural employment, industrialization and exports, renewed efforts are called for to apply the comprehensive, integrated approach of the Green Revolution to high potential commercial crops and to all regions.
 With the knowledge gained over the past 30 years, greater emphasis can be placed on ensuring that the productivity improvements are not only economically viable but also ecologically sustainable.
 Region-specific strategies should be adopted for mountain areas, high rainfall tropics, uplands and irrigated plains.
 The crops covered should include foodgrains and oil seeds, cotton and jute, sugar cane, fruit, vegetables, dairy, meat, medicinal plants, spices, and agro-forestry for fodder, fuel and industrial raw materials.
 3.UN development force for food deficit regions.
 The complex task of planning, managing and executing nationwide programmes to eradicate food shortages may be beyond the political, administrative and management capacities of some governments, hampered by the absence of training and experience, political instability or social strife.
 The slowest member country retards the progress of the whole world.
 The interests of global peace, political stability and basic human rights justify and may necessitate external assistance to help countries establish viable food security systems.
 In countries that are unable either to produce sufficient food or to initiate coordinated programmes to overcome present deficits, the international development force proposed earlier in this report can act in a trusteeship role to assist in designing and implementing integrated programmes to upgrade food production and distribution.

I wish there was some way I could repay you for everything.
 --Adriana Chapter 7 My alarm clock jerked me out of a thankfully dream-free slumber.
 Actually, as I pulled myself out of bed I realized I'd had a virtual torrent of dreams, but none of them had been possessed of the strange vividness that'd begun haunting my waking moments.
 I hadn't had one of the special dreams, ergo I hadn't had any dreams last night.
 I really needed to get out of this town before whatever was in the water drove me completely crazy.
 Actually, I probably didn't have much time in which to affect my escape.
 When it came to craziness I was already halfway there.
 After all, I'd already been diagnosed with the kind of clinical condition nobody with less than eight years of school could even pronounce.
 As amusing as my internal monologue was, I didn't let it slow my normal morning preparations.
 Almost before I knew it, I was downstairs and once again facing the dreaded decision of whether or not to eat breakfast.

 The shake was definitely there, and getting more pronounced.

After several seconds of trying to catalog the most delightful of my new discoveries, I realized I'd had my eyes closed since I'd gotten here, possibly an unconscious defense mechanism meant to protect me from sensory overload.
 The distant sound of water trickling down a rock face, of leaves gently caressing each other in the breeze faded away as I took in an amazing wonderland of light.
 The trees I'd been listening to were exactly where I expected them to be, but it took me several heartbeats to recognize them.
 Gone were the sturdy, brown behemoths I'd spent so much time climbing with Cindi.
 Instead, pillars of soft light reached up to the sky, swaying slowly back and forth with the wind, creaking in a rhythm I'd known by heart since I was seven.
 I felt tears collecting in the corners of my eyes as I reached out and touched the nearest tree.
 It was as if the world I'd known my entire life had been simply a moldy cover designed to hide the true nature of my surroundings.
 Now the mask was gone and I was immersed in vivid colors, living lights, and a sense of harmony so strong it nearly overwhelmed me.
 It was impossible to say for certain how long I sat looking at the gentle motion of the tree branches, marveling at the way things made up of light could still cast shadows when silhouetted by the harsher light of the sun.
 Only somehow the sun had disappeared, replaced by the paler, colder light of the moon.

Brandon's pack relaxed slightly, and then, presumably acting on a signal from Alec that I couldn't see, Dominic and Jasmin fell back to help Jess and I.
 Even with Dominic under my right arm, I couldn't hop along without jostling my ankle, and I felt tears gathering in the corners of my eyes again.
 Alec carefully lifted me into his arms before I took more than two or three hops.
 Jasmin had her cell phone out before she'd even made it to the stairs, and the sound of a massive engine under hard acceleration heralded the arrival of our limo.
 I leaned back in my seat as everyone else settled into their spots.
 Alec pulled out his pocket square and used it to dab away my tears.
 "I'm sorry.
 I didn't mean to set you down so hard."
 Jasmin interrupted before I could say anything.
 "Any slower and you'd have been cut off from the rest of us by those mutts."

I need to see a healer.” Rodregas stared at the sorcerer in disbelief.
 He suffered a few minor injuries and he expected they would just go get him a healer?
 The man killed people to steal their bodies and power.
 How could he think they would respond to such a request?
 “Please hurry, I need a healer now,” Van’dret demanded.
 “We will get you a healer as soon as you finish answering our questions,” said Doi’van, his voice more growl than speech.
 “First tell us who among the Immortalists are trying to break ‘The One Law’ and why,” “I can’t,” Van’dret whimpered.
 “I mean I don’t know anything about Immortalists breaking ‘The One Law.’” He suddenly groaned and would have doubled up if Doi’van had not been sitting on his chest.
 Imeralda smiled.

A more commonly accepted estimate indicates that the world’s land and water used for agriculture could more than double.
 Agriculture’s Dual Role
 Achieving food security necessitates increasing food production and employment opportunities.
 Agriculture plays a dual role in the abolition of hunger – it produces the food and it can also produce a great many of the jobs needed by households to buy food in developing countries.
 Since agriculture is the world’s single largest employer, raising production and productivity in this sector can immediately place additional purchasing power in the hands of the rural poor, who will in turn utilize the additional income for purchasing more food, clothing and other basic consumer goods that will create more jobs and higher incomes for countless others.
 The increased agricultural produce becomes raw material for a wide range of agro-based industries and services that stimulate formation of new enterprises, and create downstream jobs as well as products for further processing, domestic sale or export.
 This is the rationale behind the Prosperity 2000 strategy for India, which forms a viable model for many other countries to emulate.
 Promoting job creation in agriculture appears at first glance to contradict the global trend of the past hundred years, in which employment in this sector has declined steadily from historic highs of more than 70 per cent in the industrial nations to the point where, today, only 2 per cent of the workforce in the UK, 3 per cent in the USA and 4 per cent in Germany are directly engaged in farm operations, although a much larger percentage of the workforce in these countries work in businesses and industries linked to agriculture.
 Nevertheless, this strategy follows a natural course of development that has occurred in many countries which now have a relatively small portion of their workforce in agriculture.
 Agricultural surpluses and rising farm incomes are preconditions and stimuli to economic growth and industrialization.

 “What are we to do?” Qurrah asked.

 “Kill the messenger and the guards that accompany him.
 Vaelor will be furious at the death of family, however distant.
 He will have every excuse to war with the elves and we will exploit that war to our purposes.”
 “Will you accompany us?” Qurrah asked.

Alec slowly crossed the distance between us, and took my shoulders in his hands.
 "Please don't try and take the blame for this.
 We've been on a collision course with Brandon's pack for years."
 His touch was intoxicating.
 I could feel warm tingles start from my shoulders and work their way down my arms.
 A full two seconds of silence passed before I realized he'd asked me why I'd come downstairs.
 "I can't sleep.
 I've been trying, but I'm too wound up to do anything but just lie there.
 I thought I'd come downstairs and talk to you instead.
 I mean, unless it's bothering you.

My eyes were not that green, my hair not black.
 I straightened and held a lock of it forward to examine.
 It shimmered in the bright sunlight, glossy black.
 My hand fell away.
 Maybe I could just wash it out.
 Nauseous, I stepped into the pool, sinking beneath its surface.
 A thought crossed my mind that was darker than the rest, that said maybe I should stay under, but the pressure to draw air stung my lungs.
 I could not drown the desire to breathe.
 I pushed through the water, gasping and cold, struggling to climb from the muck as I stood and walked out.
 I was drenched, the material of the long gown soaked and heavy and more uncomfortable than ever.

"Whether that was his intent or not, the Sun didn't completely abandon him, either out of respect for what they'd shared, or possibly out of concern for her children.
 Once it became apparent that the Earth and Sun were through with each other, the Moon began to court her.
 Doomed to touch only briefly during the rare solar eclipses, they nevertheless became beloved, one to the other.
 The greatest sign of the Moon's devotion to the Sun came about when he sent his children down to the Earth to watch over and protect the sunborn, or dayborn as they are most often called."
 Alec's pause was long enough that I think I nodded off, but the sound of his voice once he resumed talking pulled me back awake.
 "Originally there were just two of the moonborn, a pair of brothers called Adjam and Inock.
 Unbeknown to the Moon, the Earth had anticipated his great gesture of love, and sent forth a plague upon the land.
 As Adjam, the elder of the brothers, descended from the heavens and touched down upon the Earth, he collapsed to the ground in pain.
 Despite his agony as the very bones of his body rearranged themselves, he managed to call out a warning to Inock, to flee back to the Moon.
 The love of Inock for Adjam was so great that he rushed to his brother's side, where he too fell victim to the Earth's plague."

Merely human eyes never could've hoped to follow all of the action.
 I got the feeling Alec's technique was superior.
 He moved from spot to spot, motion to motion with the smooth economy of a tree bending before the wind, but if he was a tree, Brandon was the hurricane.
 Flare-light reflected off of deadly claws, and blood splattered the earth as Brandon drove Alec before him.
 Gashes appeared on both leaders, wetly glistening in the green light, but they were more numerous on Alec than on Brandon.
 I expected the unseen plane to mirror the fight I was so desperately trying to track with my inferior vision.
 There should have been titanic clashes of power, ants marching up and down my skin from being far too close to ground zero, but there weren't.
 Brandon's energy beat down on Alec, beat down on all of us, but although I could feel the answering flare of power from the rest of the pack, Alec remained silent, dancing away from the worst bursts of metaphorical death at the same time he dodged Brandon's fangs.
 The flares were almost dead, but there was just enough light for me to see the smaller figure reel away from the larger as a vicious slash sank home in Alec's chest.
 Time stretched and pulled like taffy, and I had plenty of time to watch Alec fall, to feel splatters of hot liquid even standing so far away.

A home I might never return to.
 I pushed myself forward through the day, only stopping when I found a patch of sweet berries and a small, babbling creek.
 The berries were wild, small and much less palatable without the guiding hand of an elf, but the water I’d gathered from the stream was cool and refreshing.
 As evening approached, so grew the underlying discomfort with the idea of the coming darkness.
 Not that I hadn’t spent my share of time alone at home, just not alone in the middle of a strange forest outside.
 I might have run through the night and slept at day, but it made little sense to struggle out of fear.
 It didn’t stop me from seeking out a decent shelter before nightfall, though.
 Slowing my pace, I gave the surroundings more attention.
 The strangeness of the land was a little shocking, and I had to surrender the idea of finding a proper tree.
 But a half mile or so later, I came upon a suitable hollow in a low embankment guarded by the curling roots of a sycamore.

“A marvelous spell,” the half-orc gasped, fighting away a momentary wave of dizziness.
 He closed his eyes and attuned his mind to the village.
 A stench of fear trailed west.
 Women and children, all of them panicked and confused.
 “Harruq, they flee west,” Qurrah whispered, magically enhancing his voice using a spell Velixar had taught him.
 His quiet words flooded the town, audible by all yet still sounding like a whisper.
 The fleeing residents of the town heard and were terrified.
 His brother heard and obeyed.
 The two met at the edge of town.

 “I know,” she said, her voice a little shaken.
 “But we were out of options and it was the only thing I could think of.” Then she added with more confidence, “Plus, while everyone knows a knight might learn a bit of magic, a sorcerer never learns to fight.
 They have servants for that.” The three shared a smile at that.
 Rodregas was very glad that he had insisted that she learn the fundamentals of blade work.
 “So what now?” he asked.
 “Now we go see if we can get some greater sigils,” said Doi’van.
 “We?” Rodregas asked.
 “And have you decided to take a greater sigil even it if cost you most of your magic?” Doi’van nodded and said, “Yes, I like to learn magic, but we are on a mission, one that is very important.
 The Immortalists, especially Taiga, must be stopped.

 PROSPERITY 2000 STRATEGY FOR INDIA
 The potential for accelerating job creation and increasing food production through a mix of the strategies discussed in this report is illustrated by the strategy which ICPF has proposed to achieve full employment in India and thereby to raise the entire population above the poverty line by generating additional employment opportunities for 100 million persons in the coming decade.
 This strategy utilizes agriculture as an engine for growth by accelerating the development of commercial agriculture, agro-industry and agro-exports.
 It calls for a shift in thinking concerning agriculture from production for survival and subsistence to production for maximum and sustainable profit, from emphasis on meeting minimum needs to realizing maximum potentials, from commodity-based to resource-based planning.
 It seeks to tap the country's competitive advantage in labour-intensive agricultural crops and allied industries to double agricultural production - raising the annual growth rate to 4 per cent (versus 2.3 per cent in the 1980s) - achieve complete nutritional self-sufficiency, raise rural incomes and double India's total exports.
 Creating new jobs through this low-cost strategy can be accomplished entirely with the country's own resources, though foreign firms will find investment in India's agro-industrial sector very attractive.
 Initially, about half of the new jobs will be generated on farms by raising productivity through methods to improve management of micro-nutrients and water, expanding the total irrigated area by more complete utilization of the substantial additional capacity that has already been created, emphasis on more labour-intensive commercial crops such as sugar, cotton, fruit, flowers, and vegetables, sericulture, inland and coastal aquaculture, reclamation of wastelands for forestry and fodder, and increasing subsidiary incomes from animal husbandry and poultry.
 The expansion and intensification of cultivation of these products will raise agricultural output by $25 billion and generate approximately 45 million equivalent full-time unskilled and semi-skilled jobs in agriculture for unemployed and under-employed farmers and landless labour.
 The additional agricultural production will form raw material for expansion of rural industrialization and non-farm employment.

 If however they did kill the brunette, they'd come after me too.
 It was possible, it turned out, to be rational but still completely paralyzed by indecision.

 The creak of the bathroom door opening should have been a relief.
 I was expecting the tension to evaporate once there were more witnesses.

I felt my face go hot with embarrassment.
 I tried to step behind a pillar before he saw me go bright red, but knew I hadn't succeeded.
 I bit my lip as I realized how spastic I was being.
 I'd spent the last sixteen-plus years suppressing my natural tendency to form crushes on one cute boy after another.
 I'd nearly perfected the art of exhibiting zero interest in the opposite sex.
 The whole point of my existence had been avoiding the kinds of things that'd result in everyone laughing at me.
 Why was I setting my sights on a boy who was so far out of my league?
 Even if there'd been a chance he might like me, I had absolutely no idea how to proceed.
 Given the option, I would've just hid behind the pillar until everyone left for class, but Britney had made her decision, and was paying for her food.

 They shuffled their feet along the ground as they entered the room.
 They looked defeated and unhealthy as the officers who escorted them cuffed each one to a chain that ran beneath the benches as they awaited their hearings or sentencing.

 I wished my son was here to see what could have been.
 The audience in the courtroom was a colorful mixture of society’s misfits and their families.
 Again I found myself hoping nobody would recognize me or my son’s name plastered for all to see on the hearings notice sheet attached to the courtroom door.

Nobody would even miss me.
 The black wolf was inching towards me now, growling low in its throat.
 I could see its haunches tense up, and then it was airborne, hurtling towards me almost faster than I could follow.
 Only it didn't hit me.
 A patch of night had interposed itself between me and the wolf.
 My vision still wasn't up to making out fine details, and everything was moving too quickly to follow.
 The growling seemed to be in three parts now, which didn't make any sense because the patch of night was vaguely man-shaped, if impossibly big.
 There was a yelp as one of the wolves was tossed into the side of the canyon with enough force that I could feel it from where I was lying.
 A shower of sparks lit up the night as the second wolf dodged away from my defender, and then impossibly the first wolf was back and darting in as I heard jaws snap shut on something.
 The black shadow staggered back, nearly falling under the combined weight of its two opponents.

 Instead, she sat on her bed with her back against the headboard and her arms wrapped around her knees.
 Why did she feel so frightened?
 This was almost how she'd felt when she'd wandered into 2011.

After what we just went through with him… I looked Brandon in his guilty darkened eyes and I said, “Prepare yourself to find out what will happen to you every time you lie to me… are you ready?” Before he could reply or even contemplate my words, I felt the crack of Brandon’s nose on my knuckles and he flew backwards off his feet.

 Maybe kill Brandon.

 Lisa jumped up screaming and crying and yelled, “Stop!” Brandon lay face down and his blood soaked the carpet beneath his head; his hands clutched his face; he moaned and rolled over.
 Blood oozed from between his clenched fingers and ran down his chest when he sat up.
 My wife was hysterical and rightfully so.
 I stood there numb, wondering what I had done and how did my efforts to be the best father I could be turn into this?

This contributes to the high rate of primary school drop-outs and grade repetition.
 Only 71 per cent of first-grade entrants complete primary school in developing countries.
 Addressing these challenges will require a substantial increase in financial resources devoted to education.
 In most regions, public expenditure on education has risen in recent years.
 In 1990, the world average was 13.5 per cent of total government expenditure, or 4.8 per cent of GNP.
 More than one-third of the countries in the world still spend more on the military than on education.
 Efforts to improve education must go hand in hand with efforts to promote peace and disarmament and drastically curtail military spending.
 Mechanisms should be put in place to insure that a significant portion of reduced military spending is invested in education and training.
 The very highest social priority should be given to six educational goals in both developing and developed countries.
 First, there must be a massive effort to achieve UNESCO’s goal of eradicating illiteracy worldwide by the year 2000.

Maybe because I'm worried that it won't turn out to be what I think it will be.
 What about you?"
 I shouldn't have been surprised by the question, but I was.
 Possibly because I'd spent too much time around people like Britney who were so caught up in their own lives that they didn't really care about what was happening in mine.
 "Les Misérables.
 The music from the musical is so inspiring that I know the book must be truly wonderful."
 I let the statement hang in the air for a couple of seconds, and then finished up with the truth.
 "Of course I don't really know, because it's so big, and parts of it are so boring, that I may never manage to get through the whole thing."

The flames that had been coursing through me burst in my hands.
 She laughed and tossed her head.
 “Oh you should have heard it.
 You gave us such interesting details!” The image of Chevelle hearing my dreams, the sound of their laughter when I woke… I knew what she wanted and I gave it to her.
 Fire shot from my hands toward her, hotter than any I’d ever produced.
 The warmth hit my face and Ruby’s heeled boots sloshed as snow melted beneath her feet.
 She batted away the flames and smiled.
 “Come now, you’ll have to do better than that.” She kept circling.
 “Let me try harder.” She flicked her wrist, and the end of her whip caught my ankle so fast I hadn’t even realized it was moving.
 She jerked and my leg came out from under me, my hip slamming flat on the ground.

It was time to test the spells his master had taught him.
 An elderly man came around the corner, a torch his only weapon.
 He glared at Qurrah with unabashed hatred.
 “ _Weakness_ ,” the necromancer hissed in the wispy tongue of magic.
 The old man dropped his torch and wobbled on his legs.
 His elderly arms, already shriveled, shrunk even more.
 Skin tightened against his frame, and in seconds it was if the man had become a living skeleton decorated with flesh, hair, and clothes.
 The man took a staggered step forward, still determined to fight Qurrah even as his arms struggled to bear their own weight.
 He let out a moan of unintelligible loathing.
 “You are not worth my time,” Qurrah told him.

Eat up.” I responded with a quick shovel of food.
 Within 25 minutes, I was standing by the door with my stomach all queasy.
 My mom rushed forward and gave me a quick hug.
 “Be careful now and enjoy yourself!” “Right I will…” I said uneasily.
 No doubt that I was going to be very careful indeed.
 I stepped outside and the door closed behind me.
 My mom and dad watched from the window, waving happily to me.
 I returned a slow, uncertain wave and hurried off towards the park.
 As I entered the park, I spotted the rising public art statue.
 The shape twisted and stretched towards the sky, trying to touch it.

 Sometimes the lyrics come out, you know, like a poem, when I’m shaving or in the bath.

All too soon class was over, and I found myself trailing Britney up to Mrs. Campbell's desk.
 She still didn't look very happy, but there was a trace more self-control to her face than a few minutes before.
 "Britney, despite spending at least an hour at the tutor lab each afternoon, the quality of your homework hasn't come up in the slightest, so I took the liberty of talking to your father yesterday."
 Britney's gasp had all the dramatic effect you'd expect out of someone who'd spent the last decade of her life getting away with pretty much whatever she wanted.
 She was obviously pretending to be sorry, all the while figuring her current trouble would blow over quickly enough if she just played her cards right.
 "Your father agrees with me that your studies should be your highest priority, so you'll be staying an extra hour starting today, and ending once your performance improves.
 Of course you can always continue to just waste your study time, but if you choose to do that I've been assured that additional penalties will follow quite rapidly starting with the loss of your car."
 The next gasp was less impressive, but tangibly more genuine.
 Even my being next couldn't stop a flash of satisfaction at the way Britney was finally having to face some of the consequences of her actions.
 Mrs. Campbell dismissed her with a wave, waiting until she'd left, shutting the door with a tad more force than strictly necessary.

 And at those schools, when she met a new crowd of young folks just launching out toward their dreams, she wondered how much she had given up by marrying a fellow who already thought about retiring, which caused me to wonder in turn if I should I steel myself to prepare for another breakup?
 And should I make sure that if it came I wouldn’t again have to slog through the morass of missing my kid.
 Pam continued vacillating.
 One month she would talk about our child-to-be.
 The next month, she would find any such talk distasteful and contend that that her schoolwork was all her mind could process.
 No kid until she passes her exams, I resolved.
 Last October, she passed them with distinction.
 The dissertation would take a year or two but, hoping she could read and write a little while pregnant and while caring for a baby, I suggested that now was the time, if ever.

“Goodbye, Velixar,” he said.
 Then he chose a direction and staggered away.
 Slowly, and with a few wide curves through the carnage, he found a way out.
 He huddled the black robes tighter about his thin body, relishing the soft feel and perfect fit.
 Smoke clogged his lungs, but the stinking waves of it were lessening the farther he walked.
 “Where are you, brother?” Qurrah asked once he could breathe freely.
 In the dark before the dawn, it seemed he would receive no answer.
 At last, he could travel no more.
 He had no food, no destination, and no company.
 His limbs were weak and his head throbbed.

The world has changed more during the present century than in the previous nineteen centuries combined – economically, socially, politically, scientifically and technologically.
 In recent decades humankind has been buffeted by a bewildering array and intensity of transforming powers – democratization, decolonization, demilitarization, globalization, universal education, scientific advances, information, successive technological revolutions brought about by the automobile, telephone, radio, television, jet aircraft, computers, satellite communications and genetic engineering.
 Coping with such rapid change has not been easy.
 It has brought in its wake a broad array of problems – a widening gap between the most advanced and least developed sections both within and between nations, a disequilibrium between growth of population and economic growth, rising unemployment, alienated youth, increasing violence and crime, depletion of natural resources, degradation of the environment, overcrowded cities, mass migrations of talent from South to North, displacement of millions of political and economic refugees, the breakdown of the family and the erosion of traditional social institutions.
 Although much has been learned about the various stages of social and economic development, much less is known about the actual process itself by which societies transit from one stage or level or form to another.
 As a result, our efforts to speed the transition are often haphazard, stumbling and fraught with difficulty.
 Today former colonial nations such as Vietnam and Zimbabwe strive to catch up with countries that have never been subject to foreign rule.
 The tribal nations of central Africa struggle at great cost to transform themselves into modern states.
 Even within the prosperous West, the speed and extent of progress is uneven, leading to the emergence of ‘developing countries’ within developed nations, of poverty-stricken families in inner cities with rates of chronic unemployment as high as 50 per cent or more.
 Nothing is of greater value to humanity’s quest for progress than an understanding of the development process and the means for consciously directing it more effectively.

Achieving that high level will generate more than six million new jobs in the country.
 Broadening the scope to include other agricultural products, particularly textiles, the potential for accelerating global economic growth by an agriculture-led strategy is even greater.
 Cotton is a crop with a very high income and employment multiplier effect.
 Per capita cotton consumption in poorer developing countries such as India is less than half the level in China and less than a third the level in industrial nations.
 Measures of the gap between the prevailing levels of nutrition in developing countries and the levels achieved in the West reveal a huge potential for increasing demand for agricultural production, which can serve as an engine to drive the growth of the world economy.
 Extrapolation from ICPF’s studies of the employment potential of expanding agricultural production in India suggests that more than one billion jobs can be created worldwide through a strategy that focuses on raising agricultural productivity as an engine for improving diets, employment and industrialization.
 Challenges in Agriculture
 The ratio of growth of foodgrain production to population growth has entered into a period of decline over the past decade – increasing at just one per cent per year compared to three per cent during the previous two decades.
 There is a similar trend for other staple crops and meat.
 For fish, there has actually been a net decline of seven per cent in per capita world production.

In the morning we can start seeing about getting this farm in order.” With that they all worked together to get the barn organized and clean.
 There was no more talking, each had plenty of their own thoughts to mull over.
 Rodregas was feeling pretty good at the moment, dangerously positive.
 He had learned long ago that the better you felt, the harder came the emotional fall.
 He knew this was all too good to last, but knowing that it would not last also made it more important that he enjoy the moment.
 Rodregas was free.
 He was being hunted; but hunted because he had finally dealt out justice.
 He had killed two monsters, two who wore faces not their own, and who he could feel no remorse for killing.
 Rodregas had finally escaped to his quiet place in the mountains to rest and, best of all, with two companions who seemed to be good people.
 Clearly, Doi’van had a dark side and he knew little of either of his companions.

I thought of the thistle, its black roots, how it had turned to ash.
 The rabbit sniffed at the air in my direction and continued on its way, answering the matter for me.
 I was sitting in a hole, utterly alone, and it was beginning to get dark.
 Night bugs chittered, their high-pitched keens rising with the loss of light.
 I lit a thin flame to practice fire magic, leaning forward as I danced it back and forth above the ground.
 My control had progressed a good deal since my training had begun; it seemed almost easy to navigate a small flame.
 I smoothed it out into a line and traced arcs and then more intricate designs.
 The designs started to resemble portraits and I had to concentrate hard to keep from seeing them, so I focused on landscapes, but those grew from tiny village houses and trees to rolling hills and curving creeks.
 Before long, the hills rose to mountains that melted into unidentifiable monsters.
 I snuffed the flame with a wave and the den was black with night.

 He was amazed that somehow they had found a safe place to recover from the battle.
 “Of course, but let’s get something just a bit more hardy in you and maybe we can move you around a bit.
 Your body has sat still too long.
 Then, you will take a nap.
 “When you awake I will get you Imeralda.
 Doi’van is doing better than you, but I don’t think he is up to doing any visiting yet.” Rodregas nodded in relief at his words and soon enough he was once again sleeping.
 The next day, sometime around midmorning judging from the light coming in through the opening that seemed to function like a window, Imeralda entered along with a young handsome Nymph.
 He was tall with green hair and with a confident bearing to his presence.
 He greeted Rodregas with a very bright smile.

The sound of the tower was changing, the first sounds of the kitchen crew getting ready for the morning.
 Still he kept at it, though there seemed to be nothing else of wealth in the room.
 He was determined to see the evil books burn.
 They held the secrets to the Immortalist art and other dark magic.
 Leaving them would only lead to another person rising in Ravenhurr’s place.
 Several of the foulest books seemed to refuse to burn but the flames eventually consumed all, just as they had consumed Ravenhurr.
 Finally, the last of the dark books of magic were burned, and the few remaining books that felt of magic but lacked the evil stench of the others were packed in the trunk.
 Only six volumes had been free of the stench, while over forty were burned.
 The sun was now streaming into the room and he was feeling the lack of sleep.
 He decided that it would take a while for the keep to empty out as everyone went into town to ‘celebrate’ Ravenhurr’s new birthday, and he stretched out on the big four-poster bed.

The half- orc pushed him away and got to his feet.
 He glanced around, trying to orientate himself, when he felt a sharp pain stab into his back.
 He spun, his whip lashing out as it burst into flame.
 It wrapped around the man’s neck, choking out death cries as his flesh seared and smoke filled his lungs.
 The only noise Qurrah heard was the sound of skin blistering and popping in the fire.
 At last the man crumpled, the bloodied shard of glass from the bottle still in his hand.
 “Damn it,” Qurrah said, wincing as he touched the cut on his back.
 It was wide but not deep.
 Painful too, he noticed as he took a few steps.
 Furious, he turned back to the corpse of the drunken man and smashed a fist against its chest.

So, while I don’t disagree that it would be a good idea for me to practice some fighting skills, I also think we should all think of practicing magic.” She paused and said in a flat tone that highlighted her seriousness, “The Immortal Guards are made of sigil warriors who have sacrificed their ability to cast magic spells for one or more permanent enhancements.
 This makes them powerful warriors, but also limits their magic to the one or two sigil abilities.
 We need some sort of counter to this advantage.
 If we practice our magic every day, we should make a little progress even without any teachers or books.” She finished with an upturned eyebrow.
 She seemed to think that Rodregas was going to challenge her statement, and argue that they should just focus on the martial training.
 However, Rodregas had been a squire of the Order of the Soaring Heavens, one of the few orders that required magical learning of all its members and one of the few groups that knew the secrets of Sigil Searing, the permanent inscription of sigils onto one’s magic.
 Unfortunately, the secret of sigil magic was given only to those who made knighthood.
 Still, one had to learn enough magic to make the inscribing possible and that early training he had.
 “I totally agree,” Rodregas said.
 “I know only what is taught a squire of our Order, but that I am happy to share.

His attacker came in hard and fast.
 Rodregas never saw the blow to his face, but luckily it was not a direct hit as Rodregas was already moving in close.
 Before the attacker could deliver another blow he was inside his opponents swing.
 Getting close is not always the best strategy on a powerful larger opponent.
 His attacker’s large hand reached for his face.
 Rodregas turned into his weight and tried to use his momentum to drive the large body off balance.
 But the attacker was built like a bull: broad and full of muscle.
 Rodregas’ push against him had little effect.
 Something felt odd about this last attacker; his body felt wrong, not human.
 Rodregas thought, “maybe an Orqui?” That would explain the muscular build, but that did not seem totally right either.

 It was an odd gathering but I know the officers enjoyed it and I know they appreciated that their efforts had a positive result on someone.
 While we had Brandon home for this brief time we also attended a family wedding.
 The four of us, Brandon, Bryce, Lisa and myself, drove together several hours north to a coastal town in northern California.
 We all stayed in the same quaint roadside motel near a popular camping spot called Patrick’s Point.
 It was woodsy and cool and we shared a two-bedroom unit with a common kitchen and a family room with a fireplace.
 It wasn’t much but it was everything to my wife and me.
 We took long walks as a family and we talked like we hadn’t in years, or possibly ever.
 We sat by the fireplace and cooked meals together in this tiny motel kitchen.
 We hiked one day through the forest and climbed a small mountain where we stood together and looked out at the beauty of the nature that surrounded us.

 She was so small that when he used both hands, they almost completely covered her back.

 But as he stretched out beside her, she realized how very much she wanted to return the favor.
 Pushing herself up, she reached for the bottle of lotion.
 "Turn over, and I'll put some on your back."
 He flipped onto his stomach, closing his eyes in anticipation.

The work of art he slipped onto my foot was so beautiful I felt bad letting it touch the ground.
 I held it up for a second, admiring the way the lights played off its gentle curves while I convinced myself nobody was going to throw me into jail for defiling it by using it for its intended function.
 Glass, or possibly something else perfectly transparent.
 It was hard to tell for sure what it was from so far away, but it wasn't plastic.
 The cool ovals where the sole had been cut away to reveal the material underneath told me that much.
 Whatever it was, it'd been created in layers.
 The outermost material was achingly clear, while the inner layers seemed increasingly less so.
 Alec waited, another smile playing about his lips, while I came to terms with the shoes.
 He then deftly slipped the other shoe onto my right foot, and steadied me as I tried to adjust to suddenly being almost six inches taller.
 "They're perfect.

I blushed.
 He must have seen that coming, held me because of it, simply to prevent me from falling on my face.
 I was a fool.
 He helped me up, this time holding me only by one arm.
 I took a deep breath.
 “I’m okay now, I think.” His lips twisted again, but I couldn’t make out the expression.
 I could barely look him in the eyes.
 I attempted every type of magic he could come up with, to no avail.
 I was beyond frustrated.
 Worse, I could tell he was being gentle on purpose, afraid I would break.

Marie spent all day Tuesday studying it and was sure that she could pass the test.
 Rick had found out, however, that she couldn't get one without a social security number.
 Marie was disappointed, of course, but Rick wasn't sure it was a good idea for her to drive alone, anyway, and she'd eventually want to do that if she had a license.
 Besides, he was putting together a surprise for her that he knew would take her mind off driving.
 Marie was doing laundry Thursday afternoon when the phone rang.
 Putting down the lid and turning the machine on, she ran to answer it.
 "Hello?"
 "Hi, sweetheart--how is everything?"
 "Fine.
 I'm doing the laundry."

At last, when Harruq was sure Qurrah would not bring up the subject, he spoke.
 “About the guards,” he said.
 “You think they’re telling the truth?”
 Qurrah glanced up.
 “About the elven blood in us?”
 “Yeah.”
 Qurrah chuckled, but it was mirthless.
 “I do, and it does not surprise me as much as it should.

He was shy about it.
 No one knows how many he wrote before he brought the first one to the group, the one that would later be their most requested song, “I Love my Aunt Jemima.”  Soon, though, he was bringing in songs in coacervations, as if he had eons of them bubbling up.
 That first acceptance by the group opened the floodgates and Buddy Gardner became something of a songwriting machine.
 Other artists recorded many of his best things, a blessing, and he became a regular at Hi Studios, at Sun and later at Ardent.
 He was covered by many of the Mid-South’s biggest stars.
 And later by some of the country’s:  Elvis Costello did “Lemmy Caution’s Incubus.”  Van Morrison made “Blues for Sid and Shirley” a staple of his live performances.
 Led Zeppelin, for God’s sake, did “Procapé All Night,” Jimmy Page being an early fan, as is written.
 Just for the record Buddy wrote these hits for other stars:  “Buttermilk Thighs,” “Blues for Sandra Leathers,” “Wrong for the Right of Way,” “Arcade Late-Night Blues,” “Open Channel D,” “The Sins of Monk Cassava,” “They Bribe the Lazy Quadling,” “Patience Hell, I’m Gonna Kill Something,” “The Nice and the Good,” “Strawberry Fields for Only a Little While,” “Take me for Granted, Please,” “Surfing the Big Muddy,” “The Rules for Hide and Seek,” “Young Avenue Blues,” “Picnic in Overton Park,” “Chin-Chin in Eden,” “Turn on Your Love Lights but Turn that Damn Stereo Down,” and on and on.
 Buddy and the boys were off and running.
 Soon they were one of the most sought after acts, playing gigs everywhere the area offered, in clubs, at outdoor festivals (happenings), and, of course, their famous half-aborted rooftop gig on top of the Sterick Building downtown.

He was speechless and it occurred to me that perhaps elves were not a part of this human’s knowledge.
 I wondered if he would recover soon.
 I considered abandoning him and returning to watch the others, but his face was so interesting, the emotions so plain and readable there.
 But he wasn’t afraid.
 It was awe.
 I decided to have a little fun with him.
 They couldn’t possibly be dangerous.
 “Hello.” I spoke to him slowly, but it appeared he didn’t comprehend.
 He merely stood gawking at me.

“So many dead by your hands yet a single arrow nearly takes your life?”
 The half-orc froze, the vial clutched in his hands.
 An elf emerged from behind the building, his body decorated in a brilliant green cloak and silvery armor.
 It was the same elf who had fired the first warning shot to Antonil before the entire battle had begun.
 “I am but a poor outcast,” Qurrah said, hiding the handle of the whip underneath the palm of his hand.
 The coiled leather vibrated, hungering for blood.
 “Do not lie to me.
 I have watched you two slaughter my brethren.
 I have seen much of your handiwork.” The elf glared at him, ugly hatred skewing his handsome features.
 “By now your brother is dead.

Unsure of what to do, he played dumb and let the first soldier approach.
 “Careful, he’s a biggie,” the bowman said.
 “Nothing I can’t handle,” said the other before smashing the butt of his sword into Harruq’s face.
 Rage surged through the half-orc’s veins, his orcish side screaming for blood.
 He fought it down even as a mailed fist smashed against his spine.
 Harruq collapsed to his knees, choking down a furious roar.
 “Goes down easy, I say,” the guard said to the bowman.
 “How much you want to bet this guy is the sick bastard killing the kids?”
 “How much you wanna bet we can hang him even if he isn’t?” the other asked.
 Both guards laughed, and the sickness in Harruq’s gut grew.

She arrived five minutes later, and Rick's earlier impressions held.
 She was pretty and slender, friendly but just reticent enough to convince him he wasn't being pursued.
 "Lauri says you're a paralegal," Rick said as they sat sipping tea and coffee before dinner.
 "Yeah--in Charlestown."
 "Is that where you live?"
 "No--I live in the North End.
 It's not a bad drive unless the traffic is really bad."
 The conversation was enjoyable, the dinner delicious, and Rick was glad he'd come.
 "Nice girl, huh?"
 Ted whispered as Rick and Sharon were putting on their coats.

Apparently the sound of my voice was at least slightly reassuring, she was only a little wild-eyed by the time she opened the door and stuck her head in my room.
 "Oh, there you are, dear.

 I forced a chuckle.
 "Please, Mom.
 Where else would I be?
 Saturdays are one of my only two chances all week to actually sleep in.
 It isn't like I'm going to climb out of bed at the crack of dawn and go hiking or something."
 Mom's chuckle was almost genuine.
 If Alec hadn't implied she was going to suspect I'd been up to no good, I probably wouldn't have even noticed how off she sounded.

 “I want to find out where we are and where the others are.

 “It’s too late now Jazell, I just swore by the Bible.

 “Wait, Seth!” I yelled and ran into the trees.
 I scanned the trees.

He weaved his swords through three stabs, feinted a high slash, and then twirled up and around for a low thrust.
 Aurelia fell for the feint and brought her staff up high, leaving her lower half exposed.
 Her slender frame twisted.
 A sword cut a thin line across the green fabric of her dress but did not touch skin.
 She thought Harruq might stop and claim the cut counted.
 He didn’t.
 Instead he crosscut, his left arm swiping right while the other swept left.
 She turned to one side, using her staff to press one sword into the dirt and knock the second swipe just above her.
 The staff continued twirling, positioning Harruq’s hands further out of place.
 She used the awkwardness to gain further separation between them.

Moving with what had to be exaggerated care for someone capable of such speed, she rolled back onto her paws and crossed the remaining distance between us.
 Donovan released my arm as she reared up and placed her front paws on my shoulders.
 The colorless eyes didn't match any of the pack's human form, but they had Dominic's gentleness.
 She dropped back down and butted her head against my hand.
 I started petting her out of reflex, but when I slowed down out of embarrassment, she butted my hand again.
 After a few seconds she turned and slipped away, disappearing into the trees in a matter of seconds.
 The rest of the pack waited expectantly, milling about partially hidden by Alec's towering figure.
 I turned to ask Donovan what to do next, only to have the words torn away from me as a surge of power washed over me from where Dominic had disappeared.
 A momentary ripple of stillness swept through the pack, and then Dominic reappeared, this time walking on two legs.
 I'd been too overwhelmed by everything else to really register the fact that everyone was wearing some form of stretchy clothing.

"I'm not tired, I promise."
 His eyebrow arched in disbelief as I pulled him down onto the bed, and I found myself admitting the truth.
 "Okay, I might be a little tired, but it isn't a big deal.
 I want to spend as much time with you as possible.
 After all, it isn't like I'm going to be able to really get much rest between now and whenever we need to leave for the challenge."
 His wonderfully expressive face froze into the stony mask he wore so often with the rest of the world.
 "You weren't planning on bringing me, were you?"
 "It's not safe, Adri.
 I don't want to leave you anymore than you want to be left, but it's the only option."
 "No, it isn't, just bring me along."

As the magic smoothed out Rodregas smiled and said, “The ley line would be as much of a problem as a help unless, of course, the farmhouse is made of Nymph stone.” Rodregas expected the sound of pleased surprise but instead heard alarmed in-drawn breaths from them both; he saw that they were looking to the right, where he suddenly noticed movement.
 Two female Dire Cats stepped out of the orchard and made their way to the farmhouse.
 They had a relaxed, bored look.
 He thought that they gave him a casual nod, but he could not actually see any movement.
 Rodregas simply knew that these were the two Dire Cats that he had freed from the Dungeon.
 “Did everyone from that dungeon follow me?” he whispered to himself.
 The three stood there fighting to keep the horses from running and watched as the Dire Cats stepped through the main door for a moment, but left after only a short wait.
 The Dire Cats then circled the main building and went over to the far edge of the main house and then simply disappeared.
 Rodregas said, “I think they just went into the cellar of the home.
 The entrance is over there.

The water started to chill several times, but I was hesitant to get out.
 At the risk of boiling myself, I eased the magic I’d been using to reheat the bath.
 Finally, I felt well enough to stand.
 I picked up one of the soaps and washed quickly, then pulled the water from the tub to rinse the suds away.
 I’d not had much opportunity to practice with water; I added it to the list of things to work on.
 It had been a long journey, and the bath was refreshing.
 The soap left a light fragrance in the air, smelling like morning and cold, and I wondered if the fairy dust was still affecting me.
 I dried off and dressed in the clothes Ruby had put out for me.
 They were a little snug, but not enough to have been her castoffs.
 The room had its own full-length mirror and I giggled at my reflection.

Everyone I talked to at Narconon had been through the program themselves and were former addicts.
 The young man assigned to our son was wonderful.
 He explained that he had been through over a dozen programs before this program resolved his cravings and addressed his issues.
 He had been clean for six years, and I could only pray for the same result.
 He had worked there since he graduated the program and he assured me they would do their best to help Brandon.
 The facility where Brandon was staying was nearly a nine-hour drive from our home.
 We talked to Brandon on the phone occasionally and every time we did it was as if a cloud was slowly lifting and he was starting to think more clearly.
 He seemed to be growing up.
 He had never really matured like his younger brother because in his world of drugs he was not living reality.
 Easter was rolling around and we planned on visiting him with the family, but only if he completed certain parts of his program by Easter.

 I’ve got a bunch more to learn.” The last couple months of that summer, while I smashed golf balls, played baseball in Mexico on Sundays, and visited my cousins in Pacific Beach, Eric ran around with Margaret Beasley, Pam Greenman, and Lane Campbell.
 Margaret had been my friend longer than anyone except my cousins.
 Since second grade.
 All through elementary school, she was always the smartest in class, and kinder than anybody else I knew.
 She spent eighth grade in my mom's English and Social Studies class.
 Later my mom called her the brightest student she ever taught.
 And her pure and soulful singing would land her, only months after high school, on a weekly television show with a folk group, The Good Time Singers.
 That summer before our senior year, Margaret's best friend was Pam Greenman, who attended our rival high school.

Brandon had gone from a large dealer to a junkie who would do anything, say anything and sell anything to get his next fix.
 Brandon had become dispensable to Steve and the other large dealers, as he was now an Oxy addicted con man in constant search of his next dose of this potent drug.
 Brandon could trade prison for setting up the double-crosser Steve.
 Officer White was insistent that the time frame for this deal was short.
 Brandon was very ill detoxing, and the fact that he had been busted and he was on lockdown at his parents’ house was common knowledge on the street.
 There’s no easy way to bluff if everyone sees your cards.
 Officer White cooked up a scheme.
 He gave Brandon a phone number and a story for him to give to Steve.
 Hopefully this story would explain Brandon’s bust, now known by all of his associates: He was to acknowledge his bust and tell Steve that the cops didn’t catch him with drugs because no one would front him the Oxy he was to bring to the deal.
 Brandon owed everyone, including Steve, so that would not be difficult to believe.

I suddenly realized why his movements seemed so familiar.
 I'd seen dozens of celebrities being shepherded out of one award show or another by professional bodyguards who acted exactly like James was acting right now.
 Only they usually weren't so obvious about it.
 The only time I'd ever seen a bodyguard physically push their client around was when some up-and-coming soap star had a bottle thrown at her by the wife of someone she was sleeping with.
 I looked past Brandon, expecting to see something threatening headed towards us.
 I even opened my mouth to warn Brandon, but there wasn't anything there, just Brandon, still with the same casual smile as he reached out and squeezed my arm.
 "Hi, guys.
 I just thought I'd see if Adri needed a ride home."
 It was like I'd been hit by a bus.
 My arm tingled at the same time my heart started skipping beats.

 It must have been obvious I wasn't convinced, but Donovan wasn't dissuaded.
 He pointed to the cell phone, still grasped uncomfortably in my hand.
 "In the event that you need something, it is likely you can just say my name and I'll hear you.

 He was good enough, there was no question of that.
 He’d definitely be able to teach me.
 I started to ask, but fell short.
 I had no idea who this was and I probably shouldn’t let on who I was.
 He noticed my open mouth, blank expression, and sat again, eyeing me questioningly, all humor gone.
 “You seem to be really good at magic,” I offered.
 He chuckled.
 “Is that so?” “Yes, well, I… I need to learn.” “Learn?” The humor was gone again.
 “What do you mean learn?” “I’ve never, well, except for fire, and I need someone to teach me… and you’re…” I waved a hand in his direction.

The sense of terror racing along my synapses was completely irrational, and extraordinarily powerful.
 Just as the room began to spin crazily around me, I felt a gentle touch on my shoulder.
 "Mistress Paige, is there anything I can get you?
 Something to eat perhaps?
 Or if you'd rather, I can show you to the theater."
 I chopped off a hysterical burst of laughter just before it managed to emerge full force and totally embarrass me.
 Of course Alec had a theater in his house.
 Probably a pool and a gym too.
 Along with a half-dozen other amenities I'd never think of, but that the ultra-rich simply couldn't do without.
 I pulled my erratic, pointless thoughts back into a compact, nearly sensible ball, and shook my head as I did my best to give him a genuine smile.

I leaned around him to see, placing my hand on his leg as I angled my head past it.
 That broke his stare and he glanced down at me.
 I watched Chevelle, still walking casually toward us, as if there weren’t two angry panthers preparing to pounce on him.
 But I must have appeared about as threatening as a kitten, because the leg I was gripping shook with laughter.
 My angry gaze turned on my new acquaintance and he raised his hands in surrender, still chuckling.
 “I take it you know him?” he asked.
 “He’s following me,” I announced, too loud.
 His eyes were concerned, so I let down my guard, moving to stand behind him.
 Chevelle approached us, staring directly at me as if there were not the broad, tall form of the stranger between us.
 He let me see his irritation for one long moment before his features melted back into their standard sternness.

"Have you ever wondered about my mom?

 Definitely not a time for funniness apparently.
 "What do you mean?
 I've only met her the one time.
 She seemed normal enough.
 I guess a little distracted..." The chuckle I'd been waiting for surfaced, but it wasn't at all like his normal laugh.
 It was as if someone had sucked all of the joy and goodness out of the sound I'd grown to crave on a nearly subconscious level, and left a twisted shell.

And looking up to us.
 We were teenagers and we had these other guys, girls, coming up to us, asking about Dickinson and what I meant by “hoodoo on the bloody muddy” or some shit, something they heard on the album.
 It was weird.
 But, you know, I was kind of lost at that time—this was right before Lor came into my life—and I had all these groupies, all these chicks, and I’d ball them, right?, but really I’d be thinking about the music, about what’s next, musically, about soloing, about getting my axe to sound like a sax.
 I was way gone on the music, man, and it just shoved everything out of me, everything else.
 I didn’t know then, that I was unraveling, like an old sweater.
 I mean, I loved the chicks, you know, I loved them.
 But, they knew I was nowhere man, after we’d do it and I’d be lying there, I’d be a million miles away and they’d get this sad look.
 In the morning they’d be all like, let’s go to Barksdale’s for breakfast, and, well, I was using some speed at the time and my appetite was nil.
 So, they’d go off and I’d pick up the guitar.

If I catch you sniffing around him again, I'll kill you.
 No questions asked."
 My pulse skyrocketed as the raw terror hit.
 I'd heard death threats a couple of times before.
 You don't go to a school of any size without seeing fights, and usually by the time girls resort to physical confrontations they really are serious about hurting the other person.
 When girls say they're going to kill each other, they mean it.
 This was something else entirely though.
 Whoever was on the other side of the flimsy metal door I was hiding behind didn't just believe she would kill the other girl, she knew it, like someone who'd killed before.
 As scared as I was, I should have been a gibbering wreck, but strangely enough part of my mind was coldly rational.
 If I walked out right now I might be okay.

She peered at me out of the corner of her eye, twisting the cork free of the bottle.
 Maybe it annoyed her to see I was eating her berries.
 Not that she’d picked them; I was sure she’d just set a charm on an unsuspecting squirrel to make it perform her manual labor.
 “Company?” I was enjoying the bitterness of a spireberry now.
 “It seems there was some trouble in town today,” she said.
 “The elders are in an uproar.” I didn’t question any further.
 Town trouble was usually of no interest to me.
 Actually, I couldn’t think of the last time the town had had trouble… She huffed and I knew it was best to indulge her.
 “What sort of trouble?” “Apparently, Evelyn of Rothegarr came into town from the meadows at full speed wheezing and sneezing.

She had this Midtown apartment—I don’t know if I can do it justice.
 It was the most filled room I’d ever seen.
 Clutter, but, taken as a whole, it all made sense.
 She called it Plat-Eye Manor, after her dog, Plat-Eye.
 Her three-headed dog.
 (laughs)  That was some dog, used to sit next to me and fix me with its glassy eye, just sit there for hours, man, and I’d end up thinking we were talking.
 I can still remember some of the conversations I had with that damned dog.
 It was black and tan, mostly black—what was it, a mix, part Rottweiler and part hellhound.
 There was no place for the eye to rest, no blank walls, no white spaces.
 And this is like Lorelei herself, really, she is made up of so many parts, she’s a Steppenwolf, in the best sense of that word, a house of mirrors, each part of her reflects a different part of yourself once you get to know her or her you, you dig?

And, let me add here, that I got a call from Pete, it was in, oh, 1969 or so, and he’d gotten a copy of the album—God knows where—and he was agog at that cut, he asked me how I got the distort sound on my guitar.
 Pete Fucking Townshend, man.
 CM:  	Wow.
 How did you get that sound?
 BG:  	Jim’s idea.
 From “Rocket 88” of course, everyone knows that story.
 Jim kicked in my amp.
 I was dumbfounded—he was like some shaman so I didn’t protest—and that hole in the amp is what gives my guitar such a weird sound on that cut.
 I had a fuzz pedal too—a Pep box, and an Astrotone, but, Jim wanted that Memphis thing, you know, he wanted to tie us into the whole mojo, from Sun, from Ike Turner, through Keith Richards on “Satisfaction”—which is a cop from Sam, don’t let anyone tell you different, through the swamp music of Mudboy—up to us.
 At this time, remember, I was like attached to the guitar, man.

His best friend was dead.
 Brandon blamed himself for not being there to take care of Tom.
 One of Brandon’s confessions during rehab was that almost all of his friends decided to get as high as they could to attend Tom’s funeral.
 It was the beginning of his excessive drug abuse.
 Chapter 24: Let The Healing Begin As Brandon approached his fifth month as a student at Narconon, he called us and told us he was nearing graduation from the program.
 He also told us he had applied for an internship at the facility and that he wanted to become a drug counselor.
 Brandon told us he wanted to give back and stay on to help others and told us how much better equipped he felt to deal with the world which surrounds us all, but silently haunts a select few.
 The counselors at Narconon had such a profound impact on him that he wanted to have the same impact on others.
 We felt as though we were getting our son back!
 We made the long drive to attend the graduation ceremony with our younger son, Bryce, my mother, my in-laws—who were no longer in the dark— and my brothers.

Rachel's expression as she tried to understand my question was so surprised it actually managed to lighten the mood.
 "Oh, I forget sometimes how much you don't know.
 I'm normal, and Mom's normal, but everyone else is a shape shifter.
 Human-shape shifter marriages almost never happen, but when they do the kids can go either way.
 Alec became a shape shifter, and I'm just a run-of-the-mill girl without even a single superpower."
 We sat in silence for several seconds as I tried to process how that new piece of information fit in with everything else I already knew.
 The obvious, if somewhat selfish, implication was that maybe it really was possible for someone like Alec to want to be with someone like me.
 There were plenty of other things to think about though.
 "Wow, is that hard?
 I mean living with people who can do all those things?"

He could make her happy if she stayed here with him.
 They'd get married and make love day and night.
 And soon they'd have children.
 She'd have a family here, and that would make up for the family she had in 1927.
 They swam and played in the surf, but Marie thought Rick seemed very sober.
 Did he think she was still angry with him?
 Maybe he wasn't feeling well.
 Taking his hand as they returned to their blanket, she asked, "Are you feeling all right, Rick?"
 "Yeah, I'm fine."

One afternoon, I called Thomas and a strange voice picked up the phone.
 I asked for Thomas and the person on the phone said, “He is unavailable right now, but tell me what you want and I will get it ready for you to pick up.” It was obviously a cop, and I knew my brother was probably sitting there in handcuffs while they set up every idiot who called for drugs, then collected them like goldfish as they swam into the net.
 I called my mother and told her I thought Thomas had been busted; time would confirm he had.
 Everyone knew what he was doing, including my mother, but she just didn’t want to admit it to herself, and there was nothing she could do to stop it anyway.
 Later, I watched the evening news and saw reporters standing outside Thomas’s house announcing a record cocaine bust.
 Thomas was sentenced to several years in a federal penitentiary in Texas.
 He would have spent far more time if he hadn’t set up his dealer, who was an even bigger fish in the drug world.
 One of the hardest things I have ever done is accompany my mother to Texas to visit her son, my brother Thomas, in prison.
 Over the years I have seen her strive to survive situations no person should ever be subjected to, but this visit crushed her.
 The plane ride there was difficult and we spoke very little.

 Jim – Our mothers showed up…

 Liz – What happened next?
 Jim – I don’t know, I didn’t stick around.
 I couldn’t sleep for the next two nights either, so the entire dream turned into a hazy reality.

“Kill him,” Qurrah said to the bones.
 They swirled in the air above the elf like a tornado, and all at once they plunged downward, deep into his flesh.
 More shouts.
 He turned north and ran deeper into Singhelm.
 He doubted any humans patrolled the area, not after the defeat of their army.
 If he was to find safety, it would be there.
 In each ragged breath, he gasped, tasting copper on his tongue.
 His back ached, and his whole body revolted against his constant motion.
 Still, he had no choice.
 He passed by home after home, each one dark and quiet.

I heard Emily yell the first curse words I’ve heard her say in a while.
 I spotted her red arm just before my body felt like fire.
 I closed my eyes and blacked out.
 I didn’t really black out but that’s what I thought at the time.
 I opened my eyes to find I was sitting on the ground next to my sleeping body.
 I saw Emily sitting there, saying nothing for once.
 Something fell off my back and I picked it up.
 It was a wooden bow, and when I reached behind my back I felt a quiver full of feathered arrows strapped there.
 I ran a finger over the smooth, dark wood and turned to see Seth crashing out of the woods.

Great leaders possess the power to change them.
 Many of those who frankly acknowledge that external limitations such as money and technology are not insurmountable barriers to changing the world erect an alternative myth of inner determinism by insisting that the attitudes of people, and especially their leaders, cannot be changed.
 In contrast, we view attitudes as one of the greatest of human resources, one that possesses a remarkable capacity for adaptation.
 Over the past two decades, we have witnessed and been parties to a radical change in attitudes of people, leaders and nations around the world regarding preservation of the environment.
 It would have been difficult to conceive in 1970 that, in spite of the myriad technological difficulties and powerful economic interests at stake, the entire world would make such a dramatic shift of attitude so quickly.
 This change was not brought about from above by enlightened leadership, but rather from below in response to a swelling tide of public awareness and concern, growing as a result of the work of countless individuals, voluntary agencies and research institutions projected through the media, confirmed by the findings of the UN World Commission on Environment and Development, embodied in the specific resolutions of the Earth Summit and in the growing body of environmental laws being adopted by every country, and now commonly incorporated in the educational curricula at every level.
 The changes called for in this report require changes of attitude of this magnitude.
 But no longer is it necessary for a great visionary leader to espouse a new attitude.
 The higher general levels of public education, the worldwide extension of the media and the active initiative of literally thousands of institutions serving the public interest can exert a powerful force for change, which sooner or later political leaders will accept and espouse.
 What is the shift in attitudes demanded to achieve global peace and prosperity?

Aside from the depth of color, it didn’t seem extraordinary.
 I also examined the medallion, but didn’t recognize the emblems.
 Dropping them back into the pouch, I opened the scroll, reading the first line of the tiny script, “Fellon Strago Dreg.” Electricity shot through my hands and I dropped the scroll.
 My hands felt like they had been scorched.
 The unmistakable stench of charred flesh turned my stomach and I twisted my palms inward to inspect the damage.
 There were curving lines and symbols covering the skin.
 Burned into them.
 I gasped.

As recent global action to protect the environment amply demonstrates, public awareness and understanding are growing too rapidly and becoming too important in global affairs for us to rely on the present positions of governments or current public sentiment as gauges of what may be achieved in the near future.
 More reliable indices of what is possible are the underlying currents that are rapidly raising the value of the human being, bringing nations together in ever-closer co-operation and mutual interdependence, and pressing the international community to raise its goals.
 The world is blind to the measure of its own accomplishments.
 We need fully to recognize the astonishing magnitude of the achievements of the present century and fully to understand the process that made them possible.
 This process expresses itself as scientific, technological, commercial, political, economic, social and cultural development.
 But its driving force is social and psychological.
 Its prime mover is human beings.
 Becoming conscious of the process of society’s past achievements is a key to more rapid future progress.
 There needs to be a two-fold shift of our attention and emphasis from solving problems to tapping opportunities and from seeking to meet minimum needs to achieving our maximum potential.
 Preoccupation with studying problems often becomes an excuse for not dealing with them, while sapping our enthusiasm for action.

The centerpiece, done in a dimmer light than what I remembered from my dreams, was the sleeping figure.
 She was delicate-looking.
 A tiny figure, a being of light temporarily clothed in flesh, one who seemed almost at the point of breaking out of her mortal husk.
 She was so breathtakingly beautiful it was several seconds before I noticed the other, nearly unformed details of the room.
 They were so indistinct it took me a full minute to place them.
 Once I did, my eyes darted back to the sleeping figure, the gorgeous one whose features I now recognized as Cindi's.
 Only it couldn't be Cindi because the room was mine, the one here in Sanctuary.
 My pulse racing, I refused to look at the signature again.
 I now knew what it was, but if I ignored it maybe I could ignore the ramifications of everything I'd just learned.
 The room was swimming as my battered psyche finally took one blow too many, but I fought the attack with everything I had left.

 We even had a class together.

Gradually, society discovered rudimentary organizational resources – the capacity to organize productive activities in a more effective manner.
 The organization of farming utilized the tree to make a plough with which to cultivate repeatedly the same land, giving birth to sedentary societies.
 The organization of crafts, commerce, armies, governments – constructed from a fabric of customs, rules, systems and laws – each made use of the material resources for greater productivity, power and achievement.
 At each stage of this evolution, society discovered the power of knowledge to increase further the productivity of the material, technological and organizational resources at its disposal.
 A knowledge of weather patterns boosted productivity in agriculture.
 A knowledge of astronomy enabled sea-worthy vessels to travel across the oceans to distant lands.
 This led to the invention of systematic education as a method to pass on acquired knowledge and skills to the next generation and thereby continuously increase them.
 The Ultimate Resource
 These rich and varied discoveries came as the result of a careful observation and analysis of the external world around us, an infinite exploration and experimentation with things, an endless trial and error blending of minerals and plants to forge metals and produce medicines.
 As a result, for millennia we have tended to overlook or, at best, grossly underestimate the greatest of all resources and the true source of all the discoveries, inventions, creativity and productive power found in nature – the resource that has made minerals into ships that sail the skies, fashioned grains of sand into tiny electronic brains, released the energy of the sun from the atom, modified the genetic code of plants to increase their vigour and productivity – the ultimate resource, the human being.

Eric in a jock strap, beaming, his legs and arms spread as though to greet a familiar angel.
 Eric was superman.
 Strong, handsome, understanding, considerate, creative, vital, and brilliant.
 It was Eric who brought home Bertrand Russell’s Why I Am Not a Christian.
 My preferred reading was stories, but Eric wanted to commune with great thinkers and then talk about them, to explore ideas together, in hopes we might discover the meaning of life.
 As winter approached, we sat by the fireplace and took turns reading out loud.
 We admired Russell’s smug attitude, the gall of a fellow who accused Christ of utter arrogance for counting people vipers simply because they disapproved of his preaching.
 We delighted in Russell's arguments that Christianity was the principal enemy of moral progress in the world.
 Dismiss Christ, trust ourselves, we would discover the solution.

 “Thank you, my master,” whispered the half-orc.
 “I have never felt more honored.”
 Velixar placed a hand atop Qurrah’s head and accepted the tears he knew the half-orc tried to hide.
 He had long thought the weaker emotions fled from his soul, but that night he felt an overwhelming sense of pride.
 “Harruq,” Velixar said, his normally unshakable voice faltering.
 “Escort your brother home.
 Protect him, even unto death.
 He will usher in a new age to this world.
 Of this I have no doubt.” He shouted an order to Qurrah’s undead.

“Move along, move along,” Rodregas said.
 He prodded the prisoner up the roughly hewn stone steps none too gently with the butt end of the lit torch in his hand.
 "We don’t have all night."
 The rough handling of the prisoner seemed like a brash act for a man of sixty years, since the young man could have broken him in half with ease if he chose to do so.
 He was powerfully built, and towered head and shoulders over Rodregas.
 In fact the man looked rather like the hero from a bard's tale, with his square jaw and short black curls and fine dark eyes.
 In contrast Rodregas sported a bulging paunch, scrawny legs and loose teeth which gave him fits when he chewed on anything harder than a half-baked wheat cake.
 Rodregas' confidence in the prisoner's lack of retaliation came from the expression of dazed uncertainty on the man's face, a look he recognized on other prisoners whose world came crashing down around them without warning, whose lives changed forever in the blink of an eye.
 It was hard to feel sorry for the young man; since he was the kind of fellow Rodregas had lost out to all his life.
 Somewhere in the recesses of his soul, though, a glimmer of compassion flashed forth; if only because of what awaited the prisoner.

 “Please Jazell it’s nothing you need to worry about, okay?
 Just leave me be, I will deal with it.” I let my arms fall and Seth lifted his head.
 His eyes were red from crying but something in his eyes showed he was still Seth.

Rodregas had the feeling that Jordaan would have liked to keep the little frog; it was a powerful tool in the hands of an Elemental Healer like Jordaan, but Rodregas was not willing to give it up, and Jordaan never actually asked.
 The next morning they headed out for the Cathedral of Oravue.
 CHAPTER 13 A CHALLENGING PAST
 When they arrived at the Cathedral eight days later it was late in the afternoon.
 They had to hustle through the town of Oravue to reach it in time to register for the upcoming melee.
 Oravue was a good sized city, with paved roads winding up and down the sides of the hill that the town was built on.
 The whole town was dominated by the fortress like Cathedral in the middle of town.
 While the Cathedral was one of the most impressive fortresses in the known world, the town, in contrast was without walls or visible defenses of any kind, unless you counted all the winding stairs and streets that quickly got the three companions lost several times on their way to the Cathedral of the Heavens.
 The Cathedral of the Heavens was located like most powerful places of mystic significance, on a crossroad of two ley lines.
 The huge structure had been built into and around the top of a granite hilltop.

Doi’van often over reached any possible opponent, while Imeralda’s movements had little of real strength or violence behind them.
 She kept dropping her hands and leaving herself open to attack.
 He restarted slowly going over the first form’s footwork, even the small moves caused his stomach wound to bleed and he guessed he probably needed to wrap it tighter after he was done.
 Rodregas kept repeating the most basic form until he felt they were starting to get their center of gravity down, but keeping their feet free to move and their hands up ready to block.
 He was enjoying teaching Kata, both for himself and because they were both eager students and learned quickly.
 CHAPTER 8 THE TEST BEFORE THE TEST
 Over the next few weeks Rodregas, Doi’van and Imeralda fell into a regular routine.
 It quickly became clear that while Imeralda might not be a trained mage, she was far more knowledgeable than Doi’van or Rodregas in magic.
 So, while Rodregas often led the training in the morning, she led during the afternoon.
 Rodregas thought Doi’van was learning far more quickly than any of the squires that he had trained with as a teenager.

Role of Government
 Agricultural subsidies and protection are subsets of a larger issue – the role of government in agricultural development.
 The experience of the past four decades strongly supports the view that government can play a vital role in stimulating agriculture up to the stage where the rural economy demonstrates the dynamism needed to take off on its own.
 Although the Green Revolution has been widely heralded as an achievement of modern technology, the hybrid seeds and chemical-based cultivation practices that formed the technological basis for the breakthrough in foodgrain production constitute only one part of a comprehensive, integrated development strategy in which government played a central and crucial role.
 This strategy included massive, country-wide demonstration programmes to introduce farmers to new technology, the establishment of new public sector agencies for rapid multiplication and distribution of seeds, assured markets and guaranteed floor prices for foodgrains to eliminate fear that higher production would result in crashing prices, construction of additional storage capacity to house the increased production, import or manufacture of fertilizers, and, most importantly, for transport, distribution and marketing of surplus grains in food deficit areas.
 Few developing countries – perhaps few countries at any stage of development – could have marshalled resources on such a massive scale and instituted such widespread changes so rapidly without heavy reliance on the government for both planning and execution.
 In the majority of developing countries, government is still the most organized and efficient agency and the only one capable of such significant initiative.
 In formulating strategies, it is essential to take fully into account both the stages and steps of the development process.
 At this stage in their development, it is highly unlikely that food-deficit African nations can make rapid progress toward food self-sufficiency without strong government support and investment to improve technology, training, techno-infrastructure and trade.
 Once the rural sector begins to exhibit its own dynamism, as in the majority of developing countries, there is strong justification for a shift in the role of government from that of prime mover, planner and controller of development to that of catalyst and pioneer.

Based on the glasses, and the fact he had to have picked them out without any input from a girl younger than forty, I figured he was in debate, or maybe the chess club.
 He was probably incredibly nice, and boring as watching paint dry.
 Exactly the kind of guy my mom would turn cartwheels over.
 I'd have to make sure they never met.
 I took the opportunity to look a little more closely at the girl.
 Seen from profile, she wasn't quite as pretty as I'd thought originally.
 She wasn't exactly plain-looking, but her features weren't very remarkable.
 She did have incredibly soft-looking wavy brown hair though.
 It looked like debate boy had pretty much finished answering her question.
 I looked back down at my book so I wouldn't get caught staring.

He fell backwards on the ground exposing the crowd of onlookers who stood behind him.
 I stood up and walked by him, looking down at him curled and rolling in obvious agony.
 I walked through the crowd, which parted as I approached.
 Another defining moment.
 I went to stay with a friend, and I never went home again as long as Dino was alive.
 I promised myself over and over again that if I ever had children, I would never beat them.

"How does your sunburn feel?"
 she asked him.
 "Still a little sore.
 I should have put some lotion on this morning."
 "Go do it now."
 "I'm feeling too lazy."
 "Tell me where it is, and I'll get it for you."
 Following his instructions, she went to his bathroom and got the lotion.
 Opening the bottle, she sniffed it as she descended the stairs.
 It didn't smell as good as the sunscreen, so she wasn't tempted to rub any onto her own skin.

 The same darn stubborn and annoying Seth I was friends with.

 He faced me, “You should go back to the others.

 “I’m not leaving until I get my answer.” Seth traced the dirt with the end of a stick.

Tiny Netherlands, with the highest population density in the world, produces more than sufficient food to feed itself and remain a large net food exporter.
 Currently 11 per cent of the world’s land surface is used for agricultural crops, just 4 per cent more than in 1960.
 A comprehensive theoretical study of soils, climate, vegetation and topography conducted in 1975 indicated that both land and water utilized for agriculture could be doubled, if necessary, and that the earth could support 36 times the 1975 level (18 times the 1990 level) of cereal production using the same share of cultivated land.
 There would be severe practical obstacles to such a vast expansion of croplands, but these findings suggest that physical limitations to food production are not the primary constraints.
 A more commonly accepted estimate indicates that the world’s land and water used for agriculture could more than double.
 Agriculture’s Dual Role
 Achieving food security necessitates increasing food production and employment opportunities.
 Agriculture plays a dual role in the abolition of hunger – it produces the food and it can also produce a great many of the jobs needed by households to buy food in developing countries.
 Since agriculture is the world’s single largest employer, raising production and productivity in this sector can immediately place additional purchasing power in the hands of the rural poor, who will in turn utilize the additional income for purchasing more food, clothing and other basic consumer goods that will create more jobs and higher incomes for countless others.
 The increased agricultural produce becomes raw material for a wide range of agro-based industries and services that stimulate formation of new enterprises, and create downstream jobs as well as products for further processing, domestic sale or export.

“Do you truly understand Imeralda’s dual nature?” asked Jordaan.
 “She is a half Nymph.
 What does that have to do with her going or staying?” Rodregas asked.
 “Nothing, but it does if you love her.” Jordaan said with his big smile.
 His expression showed nothing but his normal cheer.
 Instead of answering the Nymph’s question Rodregas asked him one instead.
 “Do you love her?” “Of course, I would not travel this distance for anyone else.
 Imeralda is an amazing young woman… beautiful, intelligent, charming and potentially a very powerful magician.
 I cherish every moment with her.” Rodregas’ heart sank at the news.
 Life with the powerful healer would be a far better one than one with his lost crusade.

 “Are you sure what we’re doing isn’t wrong?” He twiddled his fingers, suddenly embarrassed.
 “I mean…‌ they’re children.”
 Qurrah sighed.
 He had sensed apprehension in his brother before, especially when it came to the children.
 Such nuisances needed to be eradicated.
 “If given a choice,” Qurrah asked, “would you split a seed or burn a flower?
 Let the children meet their end before they learn the torment and anguish of their parents.
 Besides, kill a child and the mother has one less mouth to feed.
 Kill the mother or father and all the children suffer and starve.”

So, after some awkward small talk—and keep in mind, she didn’t go get dressed—I made a move.
 I think I just sort of leaned in to kiss her.
 And she let me kiss her, but, man, nothing back.
 I mean, fuck, she didn’t even open her mouth.
 Don’t you hate that shit?
 So, I’m standing there, I might as well have had my dick out, and she looked at me like I was a piece of modern art that she couldn’t figure out.
 And, finally, after I had already turned back into an awkward 12 year old, she said, sorry, I can’t be doing that.
 That was it.
 That was her explanation.
 I never saw that chick again, I can tell you.

The remaining contents consisted of drawings, pictures and other personal items.
 Rodregas dumped the trunk contents on the floor, sandwiched the armor in the blankets and loaded up the trunk.
 How he was going to cart the trunk out of the tower he did not yet know.
 He went to the door and listened; it seemed to be getting quieter.
 It was the middle of the night and the stir from the ceremony seemed to have subsided, but it was only hours until dawn when everyone would be heading out to celebrate the new ‘birth’ of Ravenhurr.
 Not a true celebration for most; as their lord and master, ‘he’ was more feared than loved.
 Rodregas locked the door to prevent a surprise.
 He should have done that before; it was sloppy of him not to take such a simple precaution.
 Asking Captain Poir to send up Adapt Korin had been totally unplanned.
 He had been dreaming of killing Korin for all the 18 years that he had served in the tower.

Coming here was the best idea we've ever had."
 Normally Mom's enthusiasm was fairly catching.
 You expect that kind of energy in a child; when it comes from an adult it's hard not to react in kind.
 It didn't manage to infect me this time, but it did help focus me on the here and now.
 I figured I owed her for that, so I tried to suppress my generally ungracious nature.
 I even let her lead me up the creaky stairs to show me the 'amazing view' for the third time.
 Mom pulled the mirrors out of my hands as soon as I reached the larger bedroom, and nudged me towards the window.
 "Admit it, Adri, we didn't get sunsets like this very often in Minnesota."
 "Adriana," I corrected automatically, trying to avoid thinking about where my nickname had come from.
 The sunset was beautiful, just starting to turn the sky pink as a prelude to the glorious oranges that would no doubt follow.

The elf laughed a little but said nothing.
 Instead, she walked over and gave Harruq a quick peck on the cheek.
 “Keep your big butt safe, okay?” she said.
 The half-orc tried to answer but his mouth refused to cooperate.
 Somehow, it seemed to have become unhinged.
 Besides, it wasn’t as if he could think of anything to say.
 All his mind could concentrate on was the feel of the elf’s soft lips on his cheek, the flowery scent of her perfume mixed with sweat, and the quick brush of her breasts against his arm.
 By the time his jaw and mind began working again, Aurelia was laughing.
 “What’s so funny?” he demanded.

My shoes were at the foot of the bed; I grabbed them, but didn't put them on.
 I needed to be quiet, more now than ever.
 I crept to the other end of the suite, passing a curious collection of items ranging from a mundane, if expensive-looking, desk, to an intricately tooled broadsword, black with age, and sized as though made for a giant.
 I finally found the exit and was halfway down the hall when I heard voices for the first time.
 While it didn't sound like anyone was out-and-out yelling, they weren't the calm voices of friendly conversation.
 I quickly reversed direction, and found an external door less than a minute later.
 The voices had faded away to nearly nothing as I'd gotten further away from them, but all of a sudden they peaked into a full-blown yelling match, punctuated with an incredible crash that sent a tremor through the entire house.
 Any thoughts I'd had about trying to find a phone and calling 911 vanished as full flight instinct took a hold.
 A few seconds later I was outside and running.
 The moon was so obscured by clouds it provided only minimal light, but even the poor visibility couldn't convince me to slow my flight through the near jungle waiting outside the house.

It was the feather Ruby had tied in my hair.
 I’d forgotten about it.
 I reached up to feel for it and it was gone.
 I started to get irritated but then the feather was in my other hand and he was back, his hands now empty.
 And then, for no apparent reason but amusement, he did a few somersaults and landed in the center of the circle, smiling.
 I could only shake my head as Ruby clapped beside me, clearly thrilled with the show.
 I thought I must have missed something.
 Grey bowed out of the circle and was replaced by the two tall, silvery elves.
 I found myself startled again; I had not seen them sitting with the group, or anywhere else.

A voice hissed, “We will show him.” This was seriously starting to freak me out.
 It was like the dead were talking to me, and I shivered.
 Then I saw them.
 They slithered from the shadows of the trees and bushes.
 There hundreds of them, each easily my height.
 They were covered in black, grey green scales that were each the size of my hand.
 They were layered on its body like plated armor.
 Their beady dark, red eyes sent shivers down my spine.

 He didn’t reply to me because he had spotted Emily.
 She was slowly backing up with her palms out.
 Fire danced from her fingertips and twisted towards the troll and frost beast.
 The beast breathed and ice sprayed from its mouth.
 Emily moved her hand over and the ice evaporated into mist.
 She was holding up fine but I didn’t know how much longer.
 I strung my bow and released an arrow.
 It pierced the frost beast’s pelt and it fell to the ground.
 Emily turned to me with huge, confused eyes.

Wondering what she’d died of, he turned the page and found more information about her.
 "Jefferson Tranton handpicked Davis Runyon, heir to the Runyon publishing empire, as a husband for his daughter.
 Chandler Runyon had sold the business when his son was 19 years old so that, in actuality, Davis Runyon was heir only to the family fortune and to the power of wealth, not to the power of position.
 Eager for such, he courted both the young woman and her father.
 Tranton and his son had had a falling out when the younger Tranton had begun his own company in 1925, and because he had disinherited his son, Tranton began grooming Runyon to run his company as well as to become his son-in-law.
 In February 1927 Runyon became vice president of the import/export enterprise, and seven months later he married Tranton's daughter.
 "The marriage was apparently an unhappy one.
 Marie, who had, in her youth, had a reputation as a vibrant, fun-loving, somewhat mischievous girl, was rarely seen in public after her marriage.
 Reports suggest that she was a victim of spousal abuse.
 The official cause of her death in 1941 was an infection contracted during the birth of her youngest child.

After they stepped away from the female squire the healer came over to the other side of the bed from Rodregas and Doi’van and touched the woman’s neck.
 He looked reassured at her vital signs and said, “What did you do?” He looked nervous, though Rodregas was not sure why.
 Imeralda spoke up, “I hope you are not offended, but I am part Nymph and our healing powers work differently than yours.
 She should heal faster for the next few days.” Rodregas hid his smile; it was a good cover story.
 “Thank you,” said the healer.
 “Do you have the strength to heal a few others?
 I think we will lose several more otherwise.” Rodregas could not tell if the healer believed Imeralda’s story or recognized what was going on and was going along with it to save his patients.
 “I would be happy to help them, but I have to do it as privately as possible,” said Imeralda.
 The healer did not seem to take the odd request as being unusual and simply stepped away after leading them to two more patients.
 The healer thanked Imeralda for her healing work and the three were heading out the door when a frail voice called out, “Rodregas, may I speak to you?” Rodregas turned around and noticed for the first time the tall shapely form of Karun who had defeated him with sword and shield.

I knew he loved Christmas, which was near.
 Besides, I had given up surprise at anything he might do.
 So I hardly noted the changes in his obsessions and moods, until Christmas day.
 It was the second anniversary of losing my dad.
 After the family party at my Aunt Evangeline’s place, where my dad had eaten his final meal, I drove to pick up Eric.
 He wanted to go to Sunset Cliffs, near Fort Rosecrans where his dad was buried.
 His dad, Carl Curtis, was an Army Air Force pilot who crashed during a test flight while Eric was still a baby.
 Sylvia blamed her sister Rosarie for the crash.
 Rosarie, she believed, wielded demonic powers.

These skills admit of constant and continuous improvement without limit, in the same way that technology and organization can always be further improved.
 A comparative survey of the level and quality of skills in any country with those of countries above and below it on scales of economic and human development will reveal the crucial role of skills in development.
 A scale of progression on key skills can help every country identify its relative position, assess the scope for further progress and evolve strategies to fill the gap.
 Raising the skills of society to those of countries higher up on the scale will enable the country to move to that higher level.
 Despite enormous expansion of educational and training institutions, most developing countries suffer from a shortage of quality vocational skills among the huge number of people at lower levels of the society who seek desperately to raise their standard of living.
 This shortage retards the growth in productivity and quality needed to meet domestic needs and achieve international competitiveness.
 The technical training in frastructure in these countries should be expanded by the establishment of craft and vocational training institutes at the local level in every community to impart a wide range of basic technical skills.
 A massive programme of basic vocational and skills training should be launched on a parallel with the 100 per cent literacy programmes that are now being promoted by many governments to wipe out rural illiteracy.
 The military in many developing countries possesses the organizational capabilities and experience with intensive training to assist with this task.
 An institutional gap exists in agricultural training systems.

 Unsure of what to do, he played dumb and let the first soldier approach.
 “Careful, he’s a biggie,” the bowman said.
 “Nothing I can’t handle,” said the other before smashing the butt of his sword into Harruq’s face.
 Rage surged through the half-orc’s veins, his orcish side screaming for blood.
 He fought it down even as a mailed fist smashed against his spine.
 Harruq collapsed to his knees, choking down a furious roar.
 “Goes down easy, I say,” the guard said to the bowman.

 “How much you wanna bet we can hang him even if he isn’t?” the other asked.

 The two glanced at each other.

By the time Alec strode into class looking like the inspiration for every romance novel ever written, I was really mad.
 I hardly waited for him to sit down before I pulled my desk a little closer and hissed at him.
 "So very nice of you to come to class on the day our stupid assignment is due."
 Alec's expression was remarkable in that I'd never seen anyone look so full of life while simultaneously failing to betray even the slightest hint of emotion.
 He didn't even open his mouth as he reached into his bag and pulled out a bundle of densely-packed typewritten pages.
 The arrogance of it all.
 He hadn't even bothered to consult with me before typing up an answer that was probably completely off base.
 I pulled out my shabbier, but correct, answer and mirrored his action, tossing my bundle on his desk before looking down at his report.
 I skimmed through Alec's answer and felt my anger joined by surprise and just the slightest touch of admiration.
 He struck on exactly the same theory as I had, and done at least as good of job explaining it.

Even through the World Series, she hardly watched an inning on television.
 She preferred the dark and her radio.
 That year, the Yankees won in five games.
 The following week my mom stayed home from her job, teaching eighth-grade English.
 Her headache was so wicked, she grimaced and groaned.
 I tried to coax her to the doctor.
 She said he had already given her pain pills, which was all he could do.
 Then I came home from school and found her lying in a heap beside her bed.
 Breathing in shallow puffs, eyes open and watery.
 Above the right eye was a long gash, already scabbed over.

He took her hand and pressed his lips into her palm.
 "You're the most beautiful woman in the world, Marie."
 This evening was a wonderful end to a wonderful day.
 Like the day before, what Rick had enjoyed most was seeing Marie's pleasure.
 She'd wanted to see everything, experience everything they'd let her try.
 Everyone had treated her like an eager tourist, little realizing that she was seeing it all from the perspective of someone who'd seen debuts of Hollywood's earliest offerings.
 "Would you like to go dancing?"
 Rick asked as he paid the bill.
 "I don't think so.
 I'm rather tired, and I think I'd just like to relax and think about all that happened today."

He wore a sleeveless white tank top (a wife beater) revealing tattoos covering both his arms and wrapping all the way up around his neck.
 It seemed like an unusual choice of clothing given the ceremony and the fact that our son had requested that we bring him a suit, but we were looking across such a diverse room that it actually did fit.
 He was warm and friendly and although his appearance shocked me at first, just as our first impression of this facility had, he too won me over.
 He had high praise for many of the staff and students and high hopes for what was once a dismal future when he was a drug dealer and an addict.
 He admitted that he had started his life as a gang member.
 His life of “gang banging” had led him to do unthinkable things to others and also lead him to a life filled with an abundance of drugs.
 His drug use had turned into a drug addiction.
 He knew he needed to change his life or he would end up dead like many of his associates.
 He spoke candidly about how he needed to forget his old acquaintances and of starting a new life away from the influences that once nearly destroyed him.
 At the end of his speech, he held his “graduation” plaque proudly in the air to a loud applause.

Her being an attention hog didn't justify me being petty though.
 I just nodded instead and packed up my stuff.
 The ride home was completely uneventful, and mercifully brief.
 Britney was one of those people who drive fast normally, and even faster when they are pissed off.
 Apparently having to stay after school to study merited twenty-five over the speed limit.
 I normally would have complained--I'd become much more sensitive about speeding in the last couple of months, but I was anxious to get home, and very much not feeling like there was anything particularly special to live for.
 Not that I was suicidal, contrary to Mom's unvoiced, but obvious fears.
 I just didn't have much of anything to look forward to.
 It wasn't until Britney's Saturn was nearly out of sight that I realized our Jeep Cherokee was parked in the driveway.
 I sometimes felt I should have outgrown the need to talk to Mom when things were tough, but I couldn't deny that it felt like a big weight had been lifted off me as I walked through the door.

What keeps us going, keeps us growing.
 And, it’s not true unless it makes you laugh.
 That’s what I want to say to my critics, you know, lighten up, irony isn’t dead yet.
 Well, I don’t really want to say it to them, I mean, they’ve got their lives, their maggoty little lives, and they’ve got these things they want to say and I say, god bless them.
 But, in the end, fuck ‘em if they can’t take a joke.
 But, back to the song, here are the elements present in between the lines: candlelight, a picture of Tristan Tzara that was on Lor’s wall, post-orgasmic lassitude, the sound a needle makes stuck in the endgrooves of an LP, and, finally and most importunately, the sight of my woman’s incredible ass, naked beside me.
 That’s that song.

Nations accord special status to their agricultural sector for several reasons.
 Continuous supplies of food are absolutely essential to the welfare of the population.
 Food prices are extremely sensitive to changes in the supply of foodstuffs.
 Even a small increase or decrease in supply can lead to a very wide fluctuation in prices.
 A bumper harvest can depress prices to the point of bankrupting large numbers of farmers.
 A poor harvest can send food prices soaring beyond the purchasing power of large numbers of people.
 Buffer stocks, subsidies and incentives are used to protect agriculture from sharp price fluctuations.
 Al though the principles of free trade argue that countries should produce only those items in which they possess a competitive advantage and procure the rest from overseas, few nations are willing to entrust their food supply entirely or even substantially to foreign parties.
 For decades Japan maintained trade barriers to keep the price of rice at more than six times the international level in order to protect and preserve domestic rice producers; the US government exports subsidized wheat; and the European Community sells subsidized milk powder and butter internationally at prices up to one-third below the domestic level.
 The debate over the legitimate role of government in protection of the agricultural economy is partially a question of timing.

Taken together as a cohesive whole, they can transform global political affairs and create a highly conducive atmosphere for the eradication of the pressing economic problems confronting us.
 Recommendations on the UN, Peace Keeping, and Arms Control
 1.Establishment and maintenance of a multi-party democratic government should be made the minimum condition for membership and participation in the UN.
 A graded, time-bound programme for the transformation of authoritarian states should be drawn up by the UN in cooperation with concerned governments.
 The UN should provide assistance to nations in making the transition.
 2.A major UN Conference should be convened to examine UN institutional reform, including the composition and powers of both the Security Council and the General Assembly.
 The objective should be to restructure the UN according to the same democratic principles advocated by its members for national governments.
 3.As an interim step in this necessary restructuring, the Commission recommends expanding the membership of the Security Council from 15 to 20 members by adding five new permanent members.
 The veto power of the five permanent members of the Security Council should be abolished and the diplomatic status of the UN Secretary General should be elevated to that of a head of state.
 4.A detailed plan should be drawn up by the UN for a further 50 per cent reduction, to a maximum of $400 billion, in global defence spending before the end of the decade.

I sliced at them furiously, but I wasn’t fast enough.
 Out of the corner of my eye I saw a flash of lightning and it confused me for a moment; no storm was near.
 A vine wrapped my shoulder, jerking me back.
 I was trapped.
 I looked to Ruby, but she could not help me now.
 Beyond her, a line of long flowing robes marched through the mist… coming for us.
 The sight gave me strength, or courage, or blinding stupidity.
 I didn’t know, but I went with it with everything I had.
 I was trapped against the wall, unable to move, but there was one thing I could do.
 The sun broke through the clouds and I saw precisely what I needed.

 If she'd met him in 1927, she'd probably have felt every bit as much confusion as she was feeling now.
 He took her hand, pressing his lips into her palm.
 "If you belonged in 2011, things would be different."
 He stroked her fingers thoughtfully.
 If she belonged here, he would be pursuing her relentlessly.
 But she wanted to go back to 1927.
 So there was absolutely no point in falling in love with her.

Her mom moved aside so I could walk in.
 I unlaced my sneakers and walked up the stairs, looking at the flower paintings hung along the wall that her mom had painted in her spare time.
 I pushed open Emily’s bedroom door to see her stuffing her clothes in the drawer and flopping onto the bed.
 She pulled out my bag and threw it to me so I could set up my sleeping bag on her rug.
 Her mom called us downstairs, hopefully for food.
 She held a box of pizza.
 “You two can eat upstairs or down here.” She already knew our answer and handed us paper plates.
 I took three slices of pizza and ran upstairs.
 Emily and I sat on the floor, eating pizza and doodling nonsense in her notebook.
 The time ticked by to one o’clock in the morning.

For a mace, Doi’van had bought a piece of round solid steel from the smithy.
 It was a crude thing but of the proper size to qualify for the tournament.
 He dressed and ate quickly, and walked out to the sands of the arena.
 The arena smelled fresh.
 Sometime during the night it must have rained and young squires had raked the sands.
 The final competition of the tournament was a true melee.
 Only the top ten finishers qualified.
 There was no taking turns.
 The ten were spread out in a circle.
 In the center of the arena was a shield painted with the seal of the knighthood, a winged sword in the clouds.

Essentially out of time, I took a deep breath and followed her to a table.
 I couldn't help glancing towards Brandon's table one last time.
 I was hoping he was still smiling.
 Maybe he'd seen how awkward I was, but didn't mind.
 Maybe he even thought it was endearing.
 Failing that, I at least hoped he wasn't chuckling with his friends over the new girl's stupid infatuation.
 He wasn't doing either, in fact, he seemed to be very much involved in a conversation with the stocky boy on his right.
 The rest of the kids at the table were listening just as intensely, all except for the brunette on Brandon's left who was looking in our direction.
 My face pulled back in a smile, I even brought my hand partway up in a wave before I realized I recognized her.
 It was the trendy girl from the office, and she apparently still didn't like me.

Cassie's voice was barely recognizable, a tattered shadow of her usual arrogance.
 "I already have.
 I've already told Lucy where she stands with Ben.
 If you get in my way, if you approach him on her behalf, if you even think of acting on any of the hundred things going through your mind right now, I'll kill you too."
 My knees were weak, but I had to get out now.
 For all that I hated Cassie, there was no way this crazy chick would act on her threats when there were three of us to corroborate each other's stories.
 I quietly swung the stall door open and felt my eyes go wide as I saw Lucy curled up, sobbing, at Jasmin's feet.
 Neither of the other girls even bothered to look at me as I carefully moved to the door.
 Jasmin took half a step to the side, giving me room to get around her, but there wasn't even a slight drop in the level of menace she was radiating.
 It was like I didn't even exist.

By the time I reached the door I was contemplating just finding a decent tree and spending the afternoon outside.
 The sight of a white envelope, barely visible against the off-white door, was enough to drive those thoughts out of my head.
 It had my name on the side that'd been facing the door.
 I pulled it down as I walked inside the house.
 Mom was gone, there wasn't any reason I couldn't read whatever was in the envelope in the living room, but I found myself quickly climbing up our creaky stairs and closing my bedroom door behind me.
 I tore the envelope open and pulled out a piece of heavy paper, almost like parchment.
 The writing was elegant, a kind of flowing script that was different from anything I'd ever seen, but which paled against the sheer artistry of the sigil positioned at the bottom of the note.
 Adriana, Your words of thanks were altogether unexpected, but decidedly appreciated.
 You're most welcome for whatever small part I might have played in helping events to unfold as they would have in a perfect world.
 My actions were not such as to merit any large boon from you, but still I must ask one.

It smelled nice, and she found herself wishing for some perfume or some bath oil.
 She should have thought of that yesterday.
 After toweling her hair dry, she combed it, bound her chest, and put on the blue-green blouse and her jeans.
 Rick was coming down the hall as she emerged from the bathroom.
 "Hi--feel better?"
 She nodded.
 "Hey, let me show you how to use my blowdryer."
 He went back to his bathroom and returned with something that looked a little like a gun and had a long cord hanging from it.
 "You can use this to dry your hair.
 Let me show you."

He is the real drug dealer.
 I’m just trying to be a good dad.
 My last conversation with Ashley seemed a little muffled and the cops want to make sure they get a clear recording of the drug deal.
 The reason I am here and have insisted that I do this is complicated.
 I think I am here to save my family the anguish of watching another family member go to jail, not wanting to relive the time I watched my brother Thomas go to a federal prison for dealing drugs many years before.
 Maybe I am here because I just don’t know how to be a father and despite my attempt to be the best father I never had, I have failed miserably!
 Officer White coaches me through the sound check.
 Apparently the microphone at my jacket collar is slipping down and everything is muffled.
 I am told to pull it up, but warned that it might easily disconnect and if it did, the bust would be aborted.
 After some light tugging on the mic to get it between my collar and my neck, Officer White says the sound is good.

Their kiss was slow and sweet, and Marie sighed into his mouth.

 He tangled his fingers in her hair as he bent to kiss her neck.

 She couldn't finish her own thought, couldn't come up with a lie that was believable.

 I missed them both so badly.

Granted, the lighting was less than ideal, but it didn't look like Alec was holding onto them very hard.
 Still, neither of them made it more than a quarter of the way around before being slammed back down into their chairs.
 The tingly heat that'd convinced me Alec was staring at me earlier was back, and even more intense.
 I felt the tiny hairs on my neck stand up as the feeling redoubled yet again.
 The darker, more vocal of the two opened his mouth and got the first part of a swear word out before ending in a hiss of pain that was almost completely drowned out by a crescendo from the orchestra pit.
 Alec leaned forward, whispered something in each of their ears, and then finally let both of them go.
 I expected them to turn around swinging, or at least swear at him.
 I didn't expect them to remain in their seats stunned and shaking like trauma victims.
 An usher finally arrived to see what all of the commotion was about.
 The older boys shook themselves and then looked for a second like they were going to try and get Alec kicked out of the theater.

When we came through the pass our path widened, but the horses didn’t separate as I had expected them to.
 I decided I’d had enough of that.
 “How do I control Steed?” I could see the humor in his eyes at my phrasing, but he kept a straight face.
 “Think of where you want him to go and lead his head so.” I concentrated on turning left and we were instantly spinning, the unexpected twirl throwing me half from my saddle.
 Chevelle caught my arm and righted me on my now-still horse.
 “Maybe not so severe next time.” My face heated, but I focused on the horse’s head again, turning him back to our course as I gave a small nudge with my heels.
 I was cautious after that but it became easier to control his movement as we rode.
 I practiced guiding him, eventually even maneuvering him back and forth between the misshapen rocks and spiky brush on our way.
 I was still afraid to have him kneel when we stopped for the evening, though, imagining him rolling on top of me if I tried.
 I slid down and stretched my legs, glad for a rest after the hours of tensing every time the horse changed direction.

 Rodregas admitted to himself that he was nervous.
 The Dire Cats where magnificent beasts.
 He had no desire to hurt them, and less to be killed by them; but was unsure of how they could share the farm with them.
 Like the barn, the house was made of perfect cut stone that looked almost new; everything else had gone back to nature.
 Rodregas circled around to the back where the stone steps led to the cellar.
 He was sure that originally that there had had doors covering the entrance, but of course, they were long gone.
 Rodregas smelled what he would find well before he came around the corner.
 Next to the entrance was the corpse of a large bear which had recently been killed and partly eaten.

I suppose I’m an evangelical but I don’t like to confront people.
 Sometimes I feel ashamed that I haven't been the instigator of more conversions.
 I could offer pages of justifications, but I won't bother, as I recognize how flimsy they are.
 Still, I'll offer few recollections for the consideration of real evangelists.
 During my years between conversion and earnest churchgoing, I often experienced campus evangelists, church pastors, elders, and other enthusiasts whom I sensed wanted to make me into a notch on their belt, and who have left me doubtful about the worth of salesmen’s tactics in the service of God.
 During my college years, I would frequently get waylaid by too-friendly people.
 I must’ve looked pagan or drug addled.
 Usually they ran in twos.
 While one of them smiled, the other would ask, “Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?” “Yep,” I would say, and either stay and observe their perplexed surprise, or excuse myself before they could ask, “What church do you attend?” and then pitch theirs to me when I said I don’t, which was usually the case.
 The only effective evangelist I encountered in those days was Tony Tarantino, a lanky Jesus freak with frizzy red hair and an expression both bewildered and wise.

 Rick told her about how easy it was to get on an airplane any day and go anywhere in the world, about machines that made the house warm in winter and cool in summer, about telephones you could carry in your pocket.
 It was all so amazing.
 She'd always felt that she was living in very modern times—electricity, automobiles, the new talkie.

Asia is expected to generate half the growth in gross world product and world trade during the 1990s.
 This region will have one billion consumers of televisions, refrigerators and motor vehicles by the year 2000 and a rising appetite for both imported consumer and capital goods.
 East Asia alone, excluding Japan and China, will spend about $900 billion on infrastructure between 1992 and 2000.
 During this decade, China and India will add 21,000 megawatts of electricity generation every year and more telephone switching capacity than the United States and Japan combined.
 Latin America’s annual requirements for investment in power, water and sewage, telecommunications and transport infrastructure are estimated at $60 billion.
 Rising incomes and increasing exports to the dynamic economies of Asia and Latin America could generate as many as 1.7 million jobs by the end of the decade in the United States alone.
 The growth of the developing economies could provide the major impetus for economic expansion and job creation in both developed and developing countries.
 Government policies based on recognition of this fact can considerably improve the climate for development of these nations and correspondingly stimulate further growth in the West.
 Freer international trade will generate a flood of cheaper goods from the developing world that will give rise not only to greater purchasing power and higher standards of living for the Western consumer, but also to a ‘demand boom’ for sophis ticated Western goods and services to improve infrastructure and meet the needs of billions of consumers in developing countries.
 The vast inequalities in living standards that persist within both developing and industrial nations, and between the most and least economically developed countries, result in an enormous global loss of incomes and jobs.

The individual effect, complex linkages, mutually supportive interactions and consequent cumulative impact of these two revolutions and the nine other factors propelling global change are incalculable.
 They make this a rare moment in history for a quantum leap forward, which many have dreamed about but few believed achievable.
 Seizing this opportunity requires, most importantly of all, a change in awareness, attitude and perspective.
 Several ideas will be of abiding value in our endeavour to make the most of this rare moment.
 Our present problems and future potentials can only be understood when viewed from a wider historical perspective that avoids getting lost in the media-driven drama and intensity of momentary crisis and short-term trends.
 As recent global action to protect the environment amply demonstrates, public awareness and understanding are growing too rapidly and becoming too important in global affairs for us to rely on the present positions of governments or current public sentiment as gauges of what may be achieved in the near future.
 More reliable indices of what is possible are the underlying currents that are rapidly raising the value of the human being, bringing nations together in ever-closer co-operation and mutual interdependence, and pressing the international community to raise its goals.
 The world is blind to the measure of its own accomplishments.
 We need fully to recognize the astonishing magnitude of the achievements of the present century and fully to understand the process that made them possible.
 This process expresses itself as scientific, technological, commercial, political, economic, social and cultural development.

We talked to Brandon on the phone occasionally and every time we did it was as if a cloud was slowly lifting and he was starting to think more clearly.
 He seemed to be growing up.
 He had never really matured like his younger brother because in his world of drugs he was not living reality.
 Easter was rolling around and we planned on visiting him with the family, but only if he completed certain parts of his program by Easter.
 If so, he would be allowed a LOA (Leave Of Absence) for the day.
 If not, we would have Easter with him at the facility.
 He would have been an inpatient for over two months by then, and the Narconon program would keep him as long as they needed until he was ready to graduate or until he left on his own.
 We could only hope that Brandon stayed with the program and left only when he had the tools to stay off the dope.
 In the meantime, I handled the balance of Brandon’s court appointments with a power of attorney and I dealt personally with Officer White to have his charges dropped.
 I appeared in court for Brandon in an environment I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy.

The thing seemed as large and black as a starless night.
 Steed was pleased with my reaction, but Chevelle’s eyes rolled heavenward.
 He didn’t comment, though, simply holding out a hand to help me mount before swinging onto his own.
 “I will ride with you as far north as Naraguah and then make my way east to trade with the imps at Bray,” Steed told Chevelle.
 I swung a shocked look at my watcher, who simply nodded.
 Steed saw my confusion and gave a disapproving glance in Chevelle’s direction.
 He sat straighter, leaving me alone with Chevelle as rider and horse shot past us, a long black tail whipping in their wake.
 I stared at Chevelle.
 “North?” He looked back at me, his calm a contradiction to the thundering beat of my heart.

There is growing support in the United States for establishment of a national youth apprenticeship training programme that combines classroom schooling with on-the-job skills training to ensure a smooth transition to employment for those who do not pursue higher education.
 11.Link demilitarization to urban employment: The military possesses both the expertise and the physical infrastructure for training large numbers of people in a wide range of technical, vocational and social skills.
 Building upon success ful US Defence Department programmes that re-deploy soldiers to assist troubled inner city youth, closed military bases can be converted into large training centres operated by military teaching staff for instructing and housing urban unemployed youth during an apprenticeship period.
 12.Promote integrated urban development programmes: The Atlanta Project is a bold attempt to evolve a new type of organization to address the problems of inner city poverty and unemployment.
 The inner city of Atlanta, Georgia, has been divided into clusters in which members of the local community work closely with the staff of major corporations, voluntary agencies, religious groups and a wide range of government agencies to identify and promote employment opportunities and other poverty-alleviation activities.
 13.Promote organizational innovation: In recent years, large firms have made significant strides in improving their speed, efficiency and flexibility of response to changing market conditions by restructuring operations into independent companies and autonomous profit-centres.
 Small firms need to develop new types of organizations to help them acquire some of the benefits of larger size.
 An innovative experiment has been launched by two dozen small precision-manufacturing, defence contractors in the state of Kansas, with the support of the US Defence Department, to combine their technical, organizational and marketing resources for diversification into non-defence production.
 Initiatives of this type can help strengthen the 12,000 small tool and die-making companies in the United States as well as millions of other small companies in other industries and other countries.
 14.National service organizations: National service programmes can be very successful vehicles for providing training and valuable work experience to youth before they enter the labour market.

There the reception toward him took a significant turn for the worse.
 Many refused to meet his eye or acknowledge his question.
 The half-orc’s frustration grew.
 “That’s it,” he muttered to himself.
 “Just one more and I’m going home.
 To the abyss with all this.” An elf approached.
 He had long brown hair, walnut eyes, and an elaborate bow slung on his back.
 The hardened look on his face gave Harruq little hope.
 “Do you know of a woman named Aurelia?” he asked anyway.
 “Aurelia?” the elf asked.

The cart made to resemble a bicycle took them through the air above a moonlit village, and she squeezed Rick's hand in delight rather than fear.
 She enjoyed it so much that they got back in line and rode again.
 But as much as she enjoyed the "E.T."
 ride, it couldn't compare to the "Back to the Future" ride.
 That was really like flying--even more than in the airplane.
 It was more like having wings of her own, soaring high and low, below bridges and over mountains.
 "We really never left the ground?"
 she asked Rick as they waited to ride it a second time.
 "No.
 The car just jerks us around, and that combined with the effect of the picture makes you feel like you're flying."

 I started again, aware of my annoyed tone.
 “I don’t know.

 “Just pain and screeching.” Ruby and Steed bolted to their feet as someone came in, but it was only Grey.

 His eyes were glistening as he nuzzled her temple.

The sun hung low, its top edge barely visible above the rooftops.
 He had hoped the streets would be empty, but instead he saw a patrol of elves turn the corner, their swords drawn.
 He stepped back and hid as they passed by.
 The half-orc chewed on his fingers.
 Harruq had abandoned him, true, but perhaps he remained nearby, waiting for him.
 Then there was Velixar, no doubt furious at the elves’ victory.
 Where did Karak’s prophet linger now that the battle had ended?
 There was only one way to find out.

It was just close enough to see an amazingly thick cloud of insects swirl around it, captivated by the artificial glow.
 When I walked downstairs I found Mom's camping equipment piled in the living room.
 For all I'd tossed and turned, I must have gotten some sleep to have not heard her come in.
 I contemplated jotting down a note before just shrugging and skipping outside, happy for once to be shivering.
 It wouldn't last.
 Eventually the sun would clear the hills, and we'd be headed for eighty-plus degrees, but I could at least enjoy the next hour or so without worrying I was going to melt right out of my clothes.
 Walking down the lane, I tried to decide whether or not I wanted Brandon to show up today.
 After my mixed signals yesterday I figured there was a better than even chance he'd 'forget' to come get me.
 Strangely enough that didn't bother me as much as I thought it would.

“Ah, what a thing, a mother’s diary.” Ruby went silent for too long and I wondered if she would be returning to this one-sided conversation any time soon.
 Her eyes flicked back to me.
 “It was very fortunate for me she’d kept a journal, you see, for I would have no fairy knowledge without it.” I felt my brows draw together and tried to smooth my face.
 “No, don’t feel bad for me.
 With you in such a position.” I didn’t know what she meant exactly, but she continued, “And my dear brother has been there for me all along, helping me with the elf parts.” She kept talking as she leaned forward, seemingly unaware I’d not spoken a word in response.
 Not that she’d given me much opportunity.
 I contemplated whether this was her usual behavior toward strangers or if she felt we had a special motherless bond.
 She ran her finger through the substance in the canister and it came out coated in a deep, dark green that had the consistency of grease, which she smeared across the base of my eyelid.
 She continued rambling as she coated various parts of my body with lotions and powders, smoothed my hair with a sweet-scented cream, painted my lips with a soft balm that smelled of spice.
 After she ran out of areas to work with, she opened a tall glass container with black liquid inside and dipped a cut braid of hair into the bottle.

I swung the door open and slipped out of the car before she could respond.
 I waved goodbye with a cheery casualness I thought did a pretty good job of hiding my desire to break into tears.
 It was amazing how I'd let the numbness slip away for nothing.
 Rachel wasn't any more my friend than she'd been a few minutes before.
 Instead she was probably freaked out.
 I'd have been so much better off if I'd just stayed oblivious to everything, and ignored her like I'd done everyone else today.
 The hot Utah sun was trying to knock me to my knees as I slowly made my way down our lane.
 For a moment I thought about what would happen if I fell and hurt myself.
 By the time Mom realized I was missing, I'd be a perfectly preserved mummy, sucked completely dry by the harsh climate, exactly as ordered for a pyramid burial.
 I hadn't realized some part of me was hoping Mom would be there waiting when I got home.

Dominic and Jasmin had shaken me awake, and then helped me out of my dress and into jeans and a white shirt.
 Donovan had been waiting in the hall just outside Alec's room.
 He'd pressed objects into Dom and Jasmin's hands, and then brushed his lips across the back of my hand.
 He slipped away, and then we'd entered a brightly-lit room filled with the rest of the pack.
 Alec had picked me up and carried me out to a massive SUV that I'd never seen before.
 Everyone piled in, and despite the seriousness of rapidly approaching events, I fell back asleep somewhere en route to our destination.
 Apparently you couldn't drive all the way though, because we were walking again, or at least some of us were.
 I could just make out Isaac off a little ways into the darkness.
 He was in hybrid form and moving with a ground-devouring gait that was deceptively smooth.

This is of particular importance where regional peace and stability is at stake, as in the Middle East, over the question of access to water supplies.
 Where national environmental resources may lead to dispute and conflict, agreements should be drawn up between potential belligerents and the good offices of the UN's specialized agencies used to anticipate and avert future conflict.
 Peace and democracy can provide only the foundation for stable and productive social life, not its fulfilment.
 For that, political security has to be complemented by economic security and a blossoming of individual and cultural potentials.
 Yet here our optimism seems to flag.
 Our thoughts of the new millennium do evoke images of greater peace and stability internationally, more individual freedom and democratic rights, growing international co-operation, exciting new technologies, increasing cultural interaction.
 But they also evoke images of more people and less work – meaning fewer jobs!
 No sooner has the threat of nuclear annihilation receded, than the spectre of chronic unemployment and unrelenting poverty has risen to replace it, giving renewed justification to humanity’s deepest anxieties by transferring them to a new source of apprehension.
 In recent years, unemployment has emerged as a major cause of concern for governments around the world.
 In industrial countries, the subject evokes pessimistic prophecies of a fast-approaching future in which tens of millions of people will never find jobs, technology eliminates the need for human labour, cheap imports replace domestic jobs, welfare systems collapse under an unbearable burden, children have less economic opportunity than their parents, a widening abyss divides the rich and poor, and both markets and governments are powerless to do anything about it.

I didn't see any Mother Teresa dolls, but I was half asleep.
 At 6:30 the church was crowded, standing room only.
 I found a place against the west wall near the front section, where the seats were reserved for MC sisters in their white saris.
 They are mostly small brown women with eyes so bright, at first glance they could pass for children.
 Up front, across from me was a small choir accompanied by a guitar and electric keyboard.
 They sang folk style hymns like “Change my heart oh God, make it ever new, change my heart oh God, make me be like you.” I leaned against the wall observing the congregation, vaguely aware that my heart sorely needed to change, since that morning my pastime was criticism.
 I grumbled inaudibly at the people who crowded, trying to position themselves for a clear view of Mother Teresa's approach.
 I disdained the TV camera bearers who nudged the rest of us aside as if the front row was their birthright.
 Watching the choir, I wondered if the women wearing doilies on their heads believed the accessory would meet the spirit of Saint Paul's admonition that women should keep their heads covered in church.
 Alert for any sign of humbug or hypocrisy, I noted that one of the priests who chanted a responsorial psalm sounded much like a particularly off key karaoke singer at a late night Chinese restaurant I had endured for the sake of chow mein.

Almost before I knew it I was sitting down in Physics.
 As usual, Alec slipped into class a half second before the bell.
 I was so happy I forgot how arrogant he was, and I smiled at him as he sat down.
 It was like he was looking at something that wasn't even human.
 My insides seemed to freeze and shrink.
 I couldn't even muster up my normal blush of embarrassment.
 I'd had plenty of people hate me since I'd arrived in Sanctuary, but he was the first person I'd met who I was convinced wouldn't have thrown me a life preserver if I was drowning.
 It wasn't even because saving me would be too much work.
 He was completely convinced the world would be a better place without me.
 I'd never been so unnerved in my life.

 Well, almost anything.
 She had to go home.
 She jumped when she heard Rick's door open.
 Glancing at him, she turned and headed downstairs.
 Rick followed her, wondering if she was mad or embarrassed or confused.
 Most women would never again speak to a man who had rejected her touch.

 "I wouldn't phrase it like that."
 She loved seeing Tom again.
 He'd obviously missed her as much as John had, and as he'd escorted her in to dinner, he'd whispered that he'd pick her up at 8:00 Saturday to take her to a speakeasy.

The beast’s nostrils flared, breath steaming in the cool morning air.
 Two more of the animals pawed in the distance behind him.
 Steed chirped a whistle and they walked forward, the slim, muscular one moving to stand beside Chevelle as a mammoth crossed in front of me and knelt.
 I drew in a startled breath at the sheer size and nearness of it.
 Steed shot me a mischievous wink.
 “Well?” I was speechless, mouth agape.
 The thing seemed as large and black as a starless night.
 Steed was pleased with my reaction, but Chevelle’s eyes rolled heavenward.
 He didn’t comment, though, simply holding out a hand to help me mount before swinging onto his own.
 “I will ride with you as far north as Naraguah and then make my way east to trade with the imps at Bray,” Steed told Chevelle.

However Van’dret dared to do nothing more than glance at them as he hurried forward.
 It would not be smart to make the Guild Dealer wait for even a moment.
 The Guild Dealer Taiga was not such a common man that he did his work from a desk; his desires and commands came during parties and social events.
 However, if you were truly honored, though personal invitations to dine with him in his personal solar overlooking his city you would get told his wishes.
 As Van’dret stepped through the arch he was struck by the bare simplicity of the solar.
 The city known as the Menagerie of Sky, Earth and Water that Taiga ruled and had created over the centuries was a lush place, full of pleasures and growing things.
 Anything that could be found in the world was said to be found within its gleaming walls and exotic gardens.
 However, the private place where it’s Master worked, was a stark contrast.
 It’s marble columns and arched ceiling spoke of simply sophistication and understated power, and much more accurately reflected the nature of its owner than the over the top shows and pleasures of the Menagerie.
 Two small intricate waterfalls softly trickled down each side wall to the, providing a soft soothing sound.

Beside him, Harruq snored loud enough to wake the drunkest of men.
 Far away, a wolf howl beckoned.
 “Sleep well,” Qurrah said, leaving the town.
 His doubt faded with each step.
 All was identical to his dreams.
 A mile from town, he saw the hill, a smoldering fire atop it to guide his way.
 Waiting there was the dark man, his red eyes shining down on him as he approached.
 “Say the words,” the man in the black robe ordered.
 His voice was quiet but deep, a mixture of hate and malice compressed into audible form.
 “How can I make such a promise to one whose name I don’t know?” Qurrah asked.

I was going to do it.
 And if I got caught?
 I could claim ignorance.
 The entire clan thought I was an imbecile in any case.
 Maybe I would just see how close I could get.
 Maybe just to try… And then I was there, standing in front of the Council building and walking in.
 My attempt at stealth was a poor endeavor, but no one ever seemed to pay much attention to me anyway.
 I casually leaned around a doorway to see into the next room, where a small group of villagers stood, blocking my way.
 They spoke in low voices, and as I tried to figure a way past, something seized my attention.
 “Evelyn has been a model citizen… doesn’t seem right…” My nerves twitched as the worry from that day returned.

It was not in great shape, but it was whole.
 Rodregas watched a few of the other matches before it was his turn again.
 Except for him, everyone remaining wore full plate.
 Rodregas’ next opponent was shining in the sun in his steel; which was better than him having to face Night Bronze plate, but still not very reassuring.
 The flag fell and Rodregas dug his heals into Doom Hoof’s side and the mount plodded forward.
 His opponent’s horse looked almost as powerful, but much faster.
 The collision happened before Rodregas was fully expecting it and he felt himself hit the ground and hit it hard.
 “Great,” Rodregas muttered to himself, “He has a Dire Steed and full plate armor.” Rodregas rolled over and pushed himself up, Doom Hoof stood nosing the sand looking for food.
 “The damned beast should be pulling plows not in a tournament for knighthood.” Rodregas thought.
 Rodregas’ opponent was starting to turn around, probably to ask for his surrender.

Article 43 pledges member states to make armed forces available to the Security Council, not only on an ad hoc basis but also as a permanent standing military force.
 This provision has never been activated due to the intervention of the Cold War.
 In the wake of the invasion of Kuwait, a proposal was placed before the UN General Assembly on behalf of a group of small and militarily weak nations seeking the protection of an international ‘security umbrella’ against the threat of invasion by mercenary forces, terrorists, drug traffickers and warlike neighbours.
 The proposal was supported unanimously by the UN’s 166 member states.
 In Agenda for Peace, the UN Secretary General has recommended broadening the peace-making, peace-keeping and peace-enforcing capabilities of the UN by establishing a standing UN military force.
 With the end of bipolar confrontation within the Security Council, this proposal is practicable and should be acted upon immediately by establishing a strong permanent force drawn from 20 to 30 member states, trained and equipped for rapid deployment.
 Such a force, if established, is likely to be relatively small, however, and unequal to the task of dealing with threats from a major army equipped with sophisticated weapons.
 In addition, its deployment would always be subject to veto by any of the five permanent members of the Council.
 For both these reasons, it cannot constitute a reliable mechanism for guaranteeing the security of UN member countries.
 Although a strengthening of the UN’s peace-keeping capabilities is highly desirable, it cannot serve as an adequate foundation for a cooperative security system unless the UN’s political structure is radically modified.

I'd only ever seen him with a serious, if respectful expression.
 Even Rachel's frequent teasing hadn't ever managed to crack his 'working face'.
 "I hardly think that would be the case.
 While you may very well have lost your way, it would have been a small matter for one of the others to track you down.
 You have, if I may say so, a very distinctive smell.
 It reminds me of a type of sage brush that hasn't grown here in quite some time."
 His sigh was more felt than heard, and it put me in mind of mountains, redwoods, and other ancient things.
 "Donovan, can I ask you a question?"
 "Of course, mistress.
 I'm afraid there are many which I won't be able to answer, but it would be a delight to share those things which haven't been forbidden me."

She'd always been nice to Davis, but she'd never treated him like a son.
 But she'd love Rick.
 Rick was so warm and funny, and her mother would feel comfortable with him.
 She stopped, squeezing her eyes shut.
 She couldn't stop thinking about him.
 Even when she thought about her family, Rick somehow surfaced in her mind.
 Rick glanced at his watch.
 She'd been in the garden for 20 minutes.
 It was foggier than usual--was that an indication that there'd be a door or window or whatever back to 1927?
 Now that he'd told her he loved her, had opened his heart to her completely, he couldn't bear the thought that she might not walk back into his arms.

She agreed and the call ended.
 At the time, I didn’t understand why we didn’t just go do the deal right away, but the cops needed to get a crew together and do all this planning for the bust.
 Once this part of the deal was confirmed, the officer left the room and returned with a stack of documents for me to sign.
 I didn’t read much of it because it didn’t really matter what it said.
 They were the documents that they needed to cover their asses, period!
 Two nervous days passed before I got the go-ahead and a time and location for the drug deal.
 I was instructed to call Ashley and tell her the time but not to commit to the location.
 The police wanted the time to set up the area of the bust location and they did not want the drug dealer to come early and perhaps see them preparing.
 I was instructed to meet the police over an hour before the scheduled time.
 During this entire time since Brandon was busted, my wife and I had been working to detox him.

“I was thinking about him, if I must call him that, and what he’s like.” I rolled my eyes.
 “Emily isn’t it obvious; he’s evil for crying out loud.
 That’s why we have to go and stop him.” “I know that Jazell, gosh, but I was wondering what he looks like.” “I don’t want to know,” I said.
 Emily twirled her hair, “I know but I’m just curious.” I bit my lip.
 “If we do end up fighting this guy, you’ll get your wish.” Minutes later, Jason emerged from the trees and dropped his travel bag on the ground.
 He leaned against the statue next to Emily, giving us both feeble smiles.
 “So,” he said, trying to sound happy, “travel day today, huh?” We didn’t answer.
 “Okay looks like I’ll do the talking,” Jason said.
 “You two excited?” Emily shook her head.
 “No, Jason we’re both jumping for joy, but it’s so deep down that instead we both look like we want to slug you,” I said sarcastically.

Only while we were there he tried to do things I wasn't comfortable with.
 When I told him no, he--they--threw me out and told me to find my own way home."
 It was harder to relate the story than I'd expected, but Mallory's cluck of disapproval over Brandon's actions helped a little.
 It made me hope that maybe she wasn't going to hate me for bringing ruin to Alec and the others.
 "I was stumbling in the dark when Simon and Nathanial came for me, only I didn't know it was them, I just saw two enormous wolves running me down.
 If Alec hadn't stopped them I think they probably would've killed me."
 "Undoubtedly, but don't let it bother you, sweetie.
 This has been all but inevitable since Alec's father died.
 From the moment they were born, I could tell that both Alec and Brandon had been gifted with uncommon potential for power."
 My blank look apparently made her take pity on me.

He held Britney before him, ostensibly caressing her, but in reality using her as a shield, his dark eyes daring Alec to attack.
 Britney was apparently unable to sense the crackling power surrounding her.
 She looked completely unconcerned, ecstatic even to be where she was, clasped in Brandon's left arm.
 Brandon's lips drew back, but it wasn't in a smile, it was the human equivalent to showing his hackles.
 "Break it up!
 You kids back off!"
 The words seemed to float in from far away.
 They certainly didn't have an effect on any of the shape shifters.
 Vincent was moving too slowly for my human eyes to detect any change, but I was sure he was closer now than the last time I'd looked.
 The feeling of insects marching across my skin intensified as James started shaking.

Jason shrugged and ran in after him.
 “Wait Jason,” Emily called.
 “Dang, never mind.” She disappeared too.
 I went to follow her and hesitated.
 Seth walked up to me, “You nervous?” “Why shouldn’t I be?” I said, shaking.
 “Is going to a different world supposed to be vacation-relaxing-in-the-sun easy?” He smirked, “I never said that.” “You implied it,” I said, with a roll of my eyes.
 He sighed and pushed me into the doorway, the dark, swirling mist swallowing me up.
 I felt his hands leave my back for a second and then they were back.
 The chilly feeling welcomed me, like a long lost friend.
 As soon as the mist cleared, I was standing in a forest clearing.

Like the farmhouse, the barn was also built of the same impressive large cut stone.
 However, while the stone was in great shape, all other materials seemed to have fallen apart.
 There were several small trees and bushes growing in the barn.
 The floor was also stone, and there was not enough dirt and debris for them to grow very large.
 They had to clear a path to get the wagon in.
 Imeralda ran her hand over the stone with a surprisingly gentle caress.
 “It is Nymph stone, right?” Rodregas asked.
 She nodded and said, “Yes, I am half Forest Nymph and half AElf and this is beautiful work.” All Nymphs have a specific attachment to nature such as forest, stone or water.
 There was a lot of variation among the Nymphs, but they could do amazing things with their element.
 A connection to stone is much sought after by mages.

 "You have quite an imagination."
 "Could we go there sometime?

 He smiled down at her.
 "An island cruise would be much nicer, I'm sure.
 In fact, I think it would make a lovely honeymoon trip."
 If her heart did one more somersault today, it was going to fall right into her stomach.
 Marie and Davis spent the next day with her family, and he promised to take her out for dinner and dancing again next Saturday.
 She suspected that he might propose soon.

 Alec was gone when I looked back.
 Only the slight sway of my curtains gave evidence he'd just casually jumped out of my second-story window.
 I heard Mom's equipment bags hit the floor one after another.
 The sound of her tromping up the stairs finally roused me from my state of shock.
 "I'm in my room, Mom."
 Apparently the sound of my voice was at least slightly reassuring, she was only a little wild-eyed by the time she opened the door and stuck her head in my room.
 "Oh, there you are, dear.

A blade stabbed his side.
 Velixar whirled, his speed far beyond any mortal.
 He stepped past Felewen’s slash and slammed a hand against her chest.
 Dark magic poured in.
 Her arms and legs arched backward, her sword fell from her hand, and her mouth opened in a single, aching shriek.
 Bits of darkness flared from her mouth, her eyes, and her nostrils.
 Done, Velixar shoved her smoking body back into the alley and left her to die.
 When he turned, he snarled.
 Aurelia was gone.
 “You have delayed me my kill,” he said to Felewen’s body.

World Peace Army: The most far-sighted of ICPF’s proposals sought to evolve a practical mechanism to promote the objectives of cooperative security and democratic freedom.
 It called for the establishment of a World Peace Army, to be constituted by and open to all democratic countries willing to renounce the right to aggression against other nations and willing to contribute personnel and resources to an international multilateral military force capable of defending its members from external threats.
 Such a mechanism, so long as it is inclusive, would provide a real and viable alternative to national militarization, whether or not it was constituted by or within the UN system.
 The success of NATO in maintaining peaceful relations among the democratic states of Western Europe and North America for more than half a century is a viable model which is limited primarily by the exclusivity of its membership.
 The recent measures taken by the European Union to constitute a European Army are evidence of the practicality of establishing a similar mechanism open to all nations.
 The unfortunate situation now witnessed in Iraq could have been avoided, if ICPF’s plea for a World Peace Army had been heeded.
 Eradicating the Roots of Terrorism: Terrorism is not new to the world, but with the withdrawal of national rivalries between East and West, violence by non-nation states has increased in intensity and is viewed as a far greater security concern by the entire world.
 This has spurred an unprecedented international effort to control and suppress terrorist activity.
 But there is little hope of abolishing this menace without simultaneously comprehending and addressing the root causes of terrorism in the world today.
 In a sense, the human urge for violence has neither increased nor decreased.

Like it hurt so much I could only feel the edges of the pain.
 Spanish followed Biology; then other subjects came and went until I felt like I'd made enough progress, or possibly wasted enough time.
 I collapsed into bed hours early and slept poorly.
 Sunday was about the same, only my insides felt even rawer under the calm surface.
 Like maybe they'd had something caustic poured on them.
 I woodenly went through the motions of studying, and then finally pushed all of my books to the side and opened up Les Misérables.
 I tried to lose myself in the book, but the same worries that'd pestered me while I was trying to study continued to grate against the back of my mind.
 I hadn't wanted to come here, but I'd tried to make it work.
 Mom keeping the pendant felt like a complete betrayal.
 She'd known how it would impact me, but hadn't cared.

 I felt things I hadn't realized were knotted up relax inside me.

Steve was tasked with introducing undercover officers into the inner circle that would eventually lead to a bust that appeared to be far removed from the original contact with Steve.
 The only problem with Steve is that he was double-crossing the narcotics officers and they had come to discover his deception.
 Steve and his girlfriend, Ashley were highly addicted to Oxy and their combined drug habit made it necessary for him to continue to deal Oxy to the bigger buyers while tossing a few small fish to the officers to appease them and satisfy his deal.
 The officers knew too that Steve was beating his girlfriend and forcing her to perform “happy ending massages” and sexual favors to support her personal addiction to Oxy.
 Brandon was one of the small fish that Steve provided information on.
 Brandon had become so addicted that he could no longer supply the drug in quantity because he and Tiffanie consumed over $1000 a day by snorting or smoking it.
 Brandon had gone from a large dealer to a junkie who would do anything, say anything and sell anything to get his next fix.
 Brandon had become dispensable to Steve and the other large dealers, as he was now an Oxy addicted con man in constant search of his next dose of this potent drug.
 Brandon could trade prison for setting up the double-crosser Steve.
 Officer White was insistent that the time frame for this deal was short.

State control of farm support systems, including marketing, transportation and input supply, is highly bureaucratic, inefficient, and, often, corrupt.
 Overvalued exchange rates encourage the import of low-priced farm products, depress local farm incomes, and make exports uncompetitive.
 Underdeveloped infrastructure results in high transport and marketing costs.
 The slow rate of technological development and diffusion have slowed growth in agricultural productivity.
 Irrigation potential is underdeveloped and poorly managed.
 A major international commitment is needed to reverse the trends and end the famine threat in Africa.
 The region possesses considerable potential that could be converted into higher rates of growth.
 Africa has the world's largest reserve of arable land, one billion hectares, of which only 20 per cent is presently cultivated.
 Fertilizer use in sub-Saharan Africa is very low relative to other developing countries.
 Per hectare consumption averages just 13 per cent of the level in India and 3.5 per cent of the level in China.

In the Second World War, the ratio was one to one.
 In the Korean War, civilian deaths out numbered military losses five to one.
 In the Vietnam War, this ratio rose to 20 to one.
 Advances in the sophistication and dissemination of modern military technology have fuelled this trend.
 The Iran–Iraq War, the war in Afghanistan and the Gulf War involved the use of ballistic missiles against civilian centres.
 In all, over 5,000 surface-to-surface missiles have targeted population centres during the last five decades.
 The devastating effect of even conventional weapons on economic activity and society in general is so great that today no developed nation can afford the costs of military confrontation, either at home or overseas.
 No longer can non-combatants sit quietly on the sidelines or work productively undisturbed.
 War both between and within states has come to involve and affect all of society.
 Infrastructure and production facilities have become a principal target of military action.

 "I'm glad you've had such a good time here that you don't want to leave."
 "It's been magic, Rick.
 Thank you for bringing me.
 And for getting me into a movie.
 And for doing everything in your power to make this trip special for me."

 “Because of me,” I argued.
 “And now you’ve killed one.” But I didn’t know who had killed him.
 Anvil had stood before the man, but any one of them could have snapped his spine.
 “Frey.” Chevelle’s tone was solemn.
 “You know what they did to your mother.” And I could hear what he didn’t say.
 You know what they’ll do to you.
 I didn’t have a counter for that and he knew it.
 He took advantage of the silence, giving orders to Ruby.
 “Take her to the house.” She had me at once, towing me beside her as she retrieved our cloaks.

 Karen – I shouldn’t have been so nosey.
 Art – Bah, it’s ok, I enjoy talking to you, besides it could have been worse.
 Karen – How could have it gotten worse than that?
 Art – She could have told me that I was evil incarnate and that I turned her into a lesbian.
 I don’t know how long it would have taken to have gotten over that.
 If ever.
 Karen – (laughing) That is almost the exact same thing happened to my cousin.

He backed away from the half-orc, his sword held defensively before him.
 “What demon magic is this?” he asked.
 “Mine,” said Qurrah.
 And then blood poured out from the face of the lone elf.
 The eyeballs hit the ground before the dead body did.
 “Hurry,” the necromancer said.
 “This is but a taste of what we must do.”
 “Very well,” Harruq said.
 He tried to follow but the pain in his side stopped him.
 He clutched his bleeding side and breathed deeply.

Marie closed her eyes, drawing strength from Rick.
 She just hoped he was right.
 And she hoped it would happen soon.
 After Rick had left for work, Marie walked on the treadmill for nearly 45 minutes and then made herself a cup of tea.
 Rested, she opened the box containing the exercise movie Rick had gotten her and with delight put it into the BCR.
 No--VCR, she corrected herself.
 She got so involved in the exercises and then exploring the house that she'd only watched one of the movies--"Gone with the Wind," which made her laugh sometimes and cry sometimes and held her spellbound the entire time--by 5:30, when Rick got home from work.
 “Would you like me to get you some more movies for tomorrow?” Rick asked Marie as they prepared dinner together.
 “I still have that other one to watch.
 ‘Casablanca.’”  She handed him the green peppers she’d just chopped.

I'll go take care of some stuff then.
 You two enjoy all of that math, and I'll see you tomorrow morning.
 Maybe you'll even wait for me at your house this time."
 It unsettled me a little that such a simple statement could cause industrial-sized butterflies to spontaneously appear in my stomach, so I tried to push the thought out of my mind.
 I hesitantly returned Rachel's tentative smile, and then dug into my homework.
 Mrs. Campbell stopped by for a few minutes, obviously checking to make sure that I was over my aberrant behavior from yesterday.
 I got the feeling she would've liked to chat for a bit longer, but we had the predictable surge in attendance given the coming test.
 I gave her my best reassuring smile as she left, and then watched as she and the other tutors all bounced from one student to the next answering questions.
 As much as I would have liked to just call it a day, another good effort added to what I'd done earlier would put me two or maybe even three days ahead of my personal schedule.
 With a sigh of resignation I found my place on the page again, and started sorting out another set of variables.

But Creedence came on.
 And there was fucking Fogerty singing “Wrote a Song for Everyone” and I just snapped back.
 It was like a puzzle piece popping into place.
 I thought, man, here’s a guy, been through the mill, right?
 and he’s singing about singing for everyone and, man, I saw that it was all so selfish, this exile, this block.
 I thought, it’s ego, is what it is.
 How dare I not write songs?
 How dare I?
 So, I picked up my guitar and wrote, “Alison All Gone.”  Lorelei heard me and didn’t come into the room right away.
 She’s very intuitive that way.

 But as the fog began to lift, she could tell that she was still in 2011.
 The house to her left didn't look like any house she'd ever seen before yesterday.

The line of undead stood motionless, their unfocused eyes looking nowhere.
 The wind blew through them, shifting their hair and whistling through the holes in their bodies.
 The half- orc said nothing, just stared at the carnage and the servants of his master as he waited for Qurrah.
 The mindless rage that had consumed him slowly faded.
 By the time his brother arrived, it was all but a memory.
 “The undead took them,” Qurrah said, his breath quick and shallow.
 “Velixar did not trust us.”
 “I trust little,” Velixar said, stepping through the line of his servants.
 “The truth is I do not take risks.
 If any survived you would have been identified and my plans ruined.”

 “And I’m sure you want to be unbound?” Why is that a question?
 “Of course.” He nodded as if he were going down a checklist.
 “We know council has bound you.” I waited for the next detail, my fingers curling into my palms.
 “And we know they must be the one or ones to unbind you.” Some part of me realized the seriousness of the conversation, but all I could do was listen.
 “They are, obviously… unwilling.” The breath I drew was too sharp.
 “I know some about the binding.
 I’ve studied it.” When he stopped, I said, “All right.” I didn’t know what he was getting at.

The wagon halted as Doi’van stopped pushing it up the incline.
 He just stood there, his wild black unkempt hair seeming to blow in an invisible wind.
 Imeralda looked equally surprised and caught up.
 That was interesting.
 Clearly Imeralda would have the power to sense the stream of magic, but Doi’van had seemed equally effected.
 She turned to Rodregas; her eyebrows arched high in surprise and said, “A ley line and powerful?
 I knew there were several going through the Aridas, but your little abandoned farm is next to a ley line?” she asked.
 “Actually,” Rodregas said, “it is right in the middle of it, and there is even a small undercurrent suggesting that another weaker one crosses at the farm point.” Rodregas explained, “I had been on the run when we found this place.
 I had been worried that those tracking me were using magic.
 So to keep them off my track I traveled in and out of ley lines to throw off the magic scent.

They might even oppose finding it, but it might be our only hope.” The great head nodded, and the Goddess stepped away and was gone, but the roar that followed could be heard across the grasslands and into the forest and to the peaks of the mountains beyond.
 For a moment the Heavenly Realm was silent.
 All the creatures knew the roar.
 The great Celestial Lion was on the hunt and when he found his prey, there would be a battle to shake all the realms.
 As the roar faded in the heavens, a new Knight Captain, a chosen Champion of a Goddess, stood in the great Cathedral of the Heavens.
 He heard the roar because it was his.
 The other hunters in his pride were at his side and ready.
 It was time to start the hunt.

I went farther down the hill and the fighting spread out more.
 I tripped on a dead root and cursed as I stood back up.
 The slope started to even out more and the trees popped up again.
 Be careful.
 I stopped.
 The voice had come out of nowhere.
 The time is near.
 The voice whispered as faintly as the breeze.
 What, I thought, was that?
 You must stop it.

“Girls first, Seth.

 “Sweet dreams to you two.” “Yup sweet dreams to us,” I said and closed my eyes.
 “Goodnight Emily.” “Goodnight Jazell.” I drifted off, feeling surprising comfy against Seth's shoulder and hearing Jason softy snore.
 I opened my eyes to see myself standing in the woods.
 The sky saw clearer and it wasn't raining anymore.
 It was eerie quiet and as I stood there it felt like I had never left the woods.
 I heard a voice whispering one word over and over again.
 “Jazell...” “What?” I called.
 “What do you want?” “Jazell...” the voice whispered again.

Rodregas knew enough of magic to understand that the purpose of this circle was to keep out unwanted magical influences.
 They could interfere with the spell casting inside the circle.
 Also, the circle would hold in any magical forces inside which someone wanted to store or manipulate.
 Inside the large circle were four smaller circles.
 Rodregas’ eyes immediately went to the one on the north side made of blue sand, where inside sigils made of a yellow waxy substance laid a giant lion.
 This was not a normal lion such as those found in the nearby forest, but a giant beast.
 Ravenhurr had been lucky indeed.
 He had been able to buy several Dire Cats from the Immortalist Guild dealer Taiga.
 With magic, he caused them to go into heat.
 It was known to be very difficult to affect Dire beasts with magic, and his success had shown his power and accomplishment as a mage.

"That's a pretty detailed analysis of a book you've never read."
 Rachel blushed a little.
 "I really haven't read it.
 Maybe because I'm worried that it won't turn out to be what I think it will be.
 What about you?"
 I shouldn't have been surprised by the question, but I was.
 Possibly because I'd spent too much time around people like Britney who were so caught up in their own lives that they didn't really care about what was happening in mine.
 "Les Misérables.
 The music from the musical is so inspiring that I know the book must be truly wonderful."
 I let the statement hang in the air for a couple of seconds, and then finished up with the truth.

“Are you any good with them?”
 The half-orc shrugged.
 “Better than most.
 So yeah.”
 The elf looked him up and down, sending chills roaring along his spine.
 It seemed so strange that she had saved his life, since at that moment he felt like all she wanted was to see him dead.
 “Come tomorrow with swords to spar,” she said at last, tucking a few strands of hair behind her ear.
 “You can train me to wield my staff in melee combat.”
 “I don’t see a staff,” Harruq said.

They went to bed early that night because they had to be at Paramount at 7:00 the next morning.
 Marie, fortunately, didn't question the earliness of the hour.
 The surprise he had for her hinged on the word of a friend of a friend, and he didn't want her to find out about it and then have it fall through.
 Traffic was terrible the next morning, but he managed to find the gate he'd been told to go to.
 The attendant had his name on a list and gave him directions to stage three.
 "Why did your name have to be on a list?"
 Marie asked him.
 "That's the only way to get in."
 "How did you get your name on the list?"
 "I-I called.

“You should have left them.
 He was an evil man.
 Following in his footsteps will lead to a similar fate.”
 The half-orc said nothing.
 For a moment all three glanced about, the atmosphere akin to air before a thunderstorm.
 Qurrah broke the silence.
 “Woodhaven is behind us,” he said.
 “I have made mistakes, as has my brother.
 I saw you leave with him, and I know you sacrificed much to protect him.
 For this, I thank you.

Blood ran down his arms and sides from several minor cuts.
 The pain was good.
 It helped focus his mind.
 It also fed his rage.
 “Kill me,” he shouted to one guard after another hit and fade.
 He smacked away a thrust but did not attempt to counter.
 “Can you not kill me?” he asked, holding his swords out wide.
 Neither one attacked, instead holding their swords in defensive positions.
 Harruq shook his head, feeling his anger growing.
 These men did not fight with their hearts.

 Stupid Internet.

 Britney had my sympathy there.
 Nobody liked their parents knowing too much about their school life, academic or otherwise.
 "Wow, they talked about doing that at my last school, but I wouldn't have expected a town this small to have something like that implemented."
 We dropped our books off and started towards the cafeteria.
 Being back at my locker, back where I'd seen Mr. Gorgeous, made me wonder about him.

Growing up with the example of his mother was a powerful object lesson regarding what happened to humans that got involved with shape shifters; but given enough time, I'd exploit that tiny piece of him that wanted exactly what I wanted.

 As I ran, I realized I was still carrying the dress with me.

We look forward to his call nightly and when we hear sirens, we feel sorrow for the parents whose visions are what ours once were.
 Our entire family welcomes our son back and we all realize that no matter how helpless a situation like drug addiction seems we now know that there is help, professional help.
 Most importantly, there is hope where there is love and there is love where there is family.
 Within any family and throughout the generations there will be many moments that define you as a person.
 If you are a father or a mother now, there was a day when you were a son or a daughter.
 Perhaps one day you will become a grandparent.
 During all of these periods your experiences and certain moments mold you into who you will be.
 It isn’t easy to forget the dark places in your past but you can either learn from them and become a better person or repeat the same behavior and have it slowly destroy you.
 I make many mistakes as a father, but I have always tried the best I know how.
 Sometimes no matter what a person does as a parent, children may travel to dangerous places.

Rodregas in turn was in no mood to stop her now that his own passion was building, and there was no reason to think that they would not be repeating this experience.
 There would be other times to explore her.
 Now was time to give in to their most primal needs.
 For one last moment he held her back, slowing her movements.
 He was a little worried that she would have trouble handling his size, but she literally started bouncing on his lap and his own groans joined hers and he stopped thinking and gave himself to the pleasure of the moment.
 Afterwards, well… after several afterwards, they were curled up on her mattress.
 Rodregas was very happy he had salvaged the mattress from Captain Poir.
 He had had no way to know that the mattress was going to come in so handy.
 He lay there with Imeralda's head laying on his shoulder and her body half draped on his own and half on the mattress, he was thankful that Doi’van had clearly heard what was going on.

Doi’van wilted like a flower without water in the sun; he literally sat down on the ground.
 Rodregas simply sagged as the truth behind the half AElf’s words sank in.
 Jordaan simply stood watching the scene, without his normal expression of cheer.
 Finally Rodregas turned to Jordaan and said, “Imeralda is right and I apologize for our anger.
 It is misplaced.
 My life and the life of my friend are well worth the price and we are in your debt.” At Rodregas’ words Jordaan simply nodded and then stepped into the trees, disappearing as the Nymphs had a habit of doing when in nature.
 “I had better go apologize to Imeralda,” said Rodregas.
 “You should wait a while and let her rage cool first,” suggested Doi’van slowly.
 He spoke as one who was very familiar with rage.
 Rodregas realized that Doi’van was probably right so he sat back and tried to think of the right words to speak when the timing was better.

He appeared to have real concern as he glanced from what I was sure was now a welt to my eyes, and I struggled to keep the tears that were welling up from falling.
 I’d not had a caring touch from anyone for so long I didn’t know how to react.
 And I was ashamed.
 Fannie had authority over me, but I wasn’t a child.
 It was only that I had nowhere else to go.
 That I couldn’t leave.
 “You’ll need to learn protection spells.” “I… I can’t…” “We won’t tell Francine or the Council,” he promised, and I didn’t miss that he’d used Fannie’s real name.
 Then, softer, “We won’t even tell Junnie.” I didn’t understand.
 The cold, wet ground seeped through the material covering my legs, and I shifted, fidgeting as I looked up at him.
 “I mean I can’t do magic, just useless stuff… lighting candles…” “Then we start with fire,” he said.

 You know that by now they will be hunting us, if not because of Ravenhurr’s death, than because of the missing Immortal Guards.” “You know that I probably killed more slavers with the Black Yew bow than either you or Doi’van right?” asked Imeralda with a snort.
 “Your abilities are not of question,” Rodregas responded.
 “Your abilities as a Forest Nymph and as an archer make you a very deadly woman.
 As you gain control over your magical powers you will only become more dangerous.
 The question is whether you want to fight?” Imeralda nodded and she hesitated.
 “I will be honest,” she said.
 “I am a little torn, I have never been as afraid as during and after the battle.
 I have truly come to care for both of you.
 I have met few men of such character and willingness to take on the Guild of the Celestial Path and all their power.” She continued, “I want to be with you.

 But she turned her face away.

They were half-orcs, condemned for the tainted blood coursing through their veins.
 The people of Veldaren hurled the word at them like a dagger, but in truth neither had ever seen a full orc before.
 “Now we’ll finally see,” Qurrah said, “what we are, what we are meant to be.”
 Thousands of orcs spilled into the west, needing no light to see in the darkness.
 They howled and cheered, drums and war chants mixing with the shrieks of the skulls.
 Harruq felt his temples throb.
 A wail rolled over him as a deathly comet swirled about, spotting the two and eying them like prey.
 Try as he might, he couldn’t stop from shaking.
 “Can you stop them?” Harruq asked, squinting at the sky.
 “Perhaps,” said Qurrah, eyes distant and unfocused.

I woke in my own bed, the room lit by the dim light of a single flame suspended above my table.
 A flash of embarrassment hit as it dawned on me Chevelle must have placed me there; he must have seen my home, my room.
 And then I smiled, because he had left me a flame.
 I stretched my entire body, rejuvenated from the rest.
 I was unsure how long I’d slept but it looked like the sun was rising again and I wanted to be out of the house before I ran into Fannie.
 It was probably too early to hope to see Chevelle.
 I’d spent the last two days with him, but he hadn’t revealed anything of himself and that had only made me more curious.
 I retrieved the documents I’d hidden after my second trip to the library to find out whether they added anything to the report from the Council’s record-keeper.
 There wasn’t much new there, mostly more names, but I did notice a watermark on one of the pages.
 I held it up to the light to better see.

“For protection, Freya.” “Please,” I begged.
 He hesitated.
 I didn’t know how to convince him.
 Was it too soon for me to learn?
 I knew there was an order to the spells, knew you must earn the knowledge.
 If you went too fast or out of sequence you could endanger yourself.
 “There is no hurry,” he tried to persuade me.
 “There is,” I insisted.
 “I am running.” I didn’t know why I chose that word.
 I wasn’t bound here.

It became code between us, code for post-coital pleasures.
 By the way, the song makes reference to an actual quote.
 When they asked Casanova what made him such a great lover, he said, “The tenderness afterwards.”  So, the line “the tenderness afterwards” comes from the Seducer, gambler, necromancer and spy, Giovanni Giacomo Casanova.
 CM:  	Ok, um, “Hell in Denmark.”
 BG: 	Well, you know, Lennon’s “Norwegian Wood?” Yeah, man, that’s about some affair he had, right?
 But, he couldn’t talk about it because of Cynthia.
 So, he writes this piece of surrealistic poetry and he sings it, man, in this voice as old as the shepherds.
 Well, “Hell in Denmark” started that way.
 It’s code, man.
 But, you know, I don’t hide anything from my Love.

 Her blush deepened, and she scrubbed her skin frantically.
 She was betrothed to Davis.
 She lived in 1927.
 She was going back.
 Then she'd be able to talk to her mother about any confusing feelings that might linger.
 She put on her Egyptian-motif dress, her ugly black shoes, and even her 1927 underwear.
 Rick, thankfully, was in his own shower when she went downstairs and out to the garden.
 She didn't really think she'd be able to get back on a clear, bright afternoon, but she needed to put herself closer, emotionally at least, to home.

They seemed to understand and she bounded back over to me and drew me to sit beside her on a large rock facing the men before cueing them to begin.
 The largest stepped forward, boasting deep brown hair and eyes.
 He wore plain clothing but his broad shoulders and massive size made him seem regal.
 “They name me Anvil but I am Reed, of Keithar Peak.” His voice was thick, though it was impossible to tell whether it was an accent or he had difficulty speaking.
 He was huge, frighteningly so, but something about him drew me in.
 I wanted to be his friend for no reason I could rationalize.
 He walked to me and reached out his hand in greeting.
 As I took it in mine, a tingle ran up my arm, the fine hairs standing on end.
 Anvil smiled.

That hadn't changed, but now there was a distinct possibility Jasmin was going to hurt me just to ensure I stayed silent.
 Oh, and I was actually considering opening myself up for some very nasty ridicule, just on the infinitesimally slim chance a boy who was so popular, rich, and gorgeous that he shouldn't even know my name might be interested in me.
 Life was supposed to get better as you got older, but it was starting to look like it just got more complicated.
 Just before I looked back down at the shiny aluminum of my now-naked can, Brandon looked up and caught my eye.
 The smile on his face seemed to say all kinds of things.
 I'm sorry I can't come over and talk.
 They all really depend on me.
 This whole thing with Jasmin is really crazy; we've got to figure out how best to handle it.
 Maybe it really said all of those things, or maybe I was completely deluded, but it was definitely a smile.
 That alone was enough to make my heart skip a beat, and send a warm tingly feeling lapping through me like a wave of distilled happiness.

Nobody we'd known back in Minnesota could've strong-armed both the president of a bank and the mayor.
 Especially not from all the way back there.
 It had to be someone local, and they had to be either rich, powerful, or both.
 The answer was so obvious I felt like an idiot for not realizing who it was from the start.
 Who had I been told, almost from my first day here, were the two most influential families in Sanctuary?
 The Worthingfields and the Graveses.
 Both of which had at least one member of the family my age, one of whom seemed to hate me profoundly.
 What was it the mayor had said?
 "I can't promise he'll even read it."
 It was a he who'd intervened on our behalf, and Rachel and Alec's father had died years ago, while Brandon's father...actually I knew next to nothing about Brandon's parents.

During the Second World War Ford Motors converted from manufacture of cars for the masses to making trucks and airplanes for the military, producing B-24 bombers at the rate of one per hour from a single production plant.
 If conversion from civilian to military production could be carried out by so many countries within one or two years, it must be possible to convert the military from war-based to peace-based applications, and defence industries from military to civilian production, within half a decade.
 That requires human resourcefulness in organizational innovation.
 Organization is the means by which people work together cooperatively to achieve common goals and, in the process, to serve society in a wide range of functions.
 The achievement of food security and full employment depends on the establishment of new types of public and private organizations – commercial, financial, industrial, export, research, educational and training.
 These institutions are needed to encourage, support, standardize, regulate and control development activities.
 New institutions lie behind the success of most major development achievements.
 India’s Green Revolution was as much a product of new quasi-governmental organizations created for supplying inputs, warehousing and marketing as it was of new farm technology.
 India’s dairy revolution was propelled by the rapid proliferation of producer cooperatives.
 Thirty years ago government was the only agency capable of setting up and managing activities on so massive a scale.

Ahrqur nodded, his eyes seething.
 Velixar reached out and placed his hand on the elf’s forehead.
 Qurrah watched as smoke rose from their contact, yet neither flinched.
 When the necromancer drew back his hand, a strange symbol lay overtop the faint scarring of the slanted Y.
 It was of a fallen man wreathed in flame.
 “When you fall, the enchantment upon your forehead shall burn your body to ash.
 Then your soul may find peace.”
 “I shall do as you command,” Ahrqur said in a lifeless voice.
 “Of course,” Velixar said.
 “There is no other way.”

The hood of the cloak was drawn over my head, Chevelle standing a good distance away, facing the trees.
 I was watching him as two men drew near.
 I hadn’t seen them; they must have been concealed, or camouflaged by magic as I had been days before.
 The tassels decorating their long robes identified them as members of council, but I wasn’t familiar with the two.
 They mustn’t have been from the village.
 As they approached Chevelle cautiously, I examined their insignia.
 Even if they weren’t from the village, I still needed council members to unbind me, and I had a sudden urge to go to them.
 But I remembered my warning to be still.
 “She’s not going back.” Chevelle’s tone, level and uncompromising, caught my attention.
 I pushed the hood back to better hear and the taller figure glared at me as he hissed, “You’re protecting her when you know what she’s capable of?” I flinched at his words, but something else had caught my eye.

Van’dret hesitated for a moment, not sure if he should respond.
 But, Gracella was an impressive Immortalist and a rising star in the Guild.
 She had been Oreintvenir own Adapt when she was young, and as a favored member of the Guild, her friendship could prove important some day.
 “He simply wanted me to keep an eye out when I travel to the Cathedral of the Heavens,” he responded.
 The two of them were slowly walking back to his suite through the gleaming marble corridors with their wide windows and breath taking views of the city below; they both shared polite nods to other Immortalist, mostly young Adapts who resided in the city.
 She did not respond to his answer at first, finally she asked “Does he want you to keep an eye out for Oreintvenir?” Van’dret shook his head and said.
 “He mentioned Ravenhurr as a concern.” “But, he simply went mad.
 That is not uncommon,” she said with a voice laced with surprise.
 “Actually,” said Van’dret, “it is very rare for a Master of Ravenhurr’s level to go mad.
 I am not sure if you ever met him, but he was good, very good.” “Then in that case we had better all keep our eyes open.” She said.

The tracker’s words waited in Chevelle’s hand.
 “Okay,” I said, feeling slightly detached from myself.
 “Let’s try it.” Chevelle’s disbelief was more than evident as he shot back, “No.” Ruby spoke up.
 “It could be a trick.
 He’ll need to try it on someone else first.” Someone else?
 Who else was bound?
 She could see I was prepared to argue.
 “It isn’t safe.” “And if it doesn’t work?” She didn’t answer.
 I remembered the story of her father then, how he’d been released after the fairy’s death.

I’d never been able to move objects, but it seemed I had done it without thinking.
 And it wasn’t just that, but the thistle.
 I needed to see Junnie.
 The door was partially open when I reached Junnie’s house, so I peeked my head in and called for her.
 When she didn’t answer, I slipped in to check the back room.
 As I walked through the sparsely decorated living area, I passed a carved mirror on the wall and noticed something off in my reflection.
 I knew I was flushed, I could feel the frustration and worry, but I stopped to get a closer look.
 There was something not right with my complexion, but what was really off was just above my face.
 I squinted, leaning toward the mirror as my hands reached up of their own accord.
 The first quarter inch of my hair was blackened.

It was like he had a split personality.
 When he was thinking about it, he was ultra-careful not to do anything to deepen the Ja'tell bond.
 Other times, usually when he was thinking about something else, he'd unconsciously reach out to me.
 I still wasn't sure which option I preferred.
 Every moment we spent together made me want to touch him that much more, but the idea of being addicted to anyone, even him, was more than a little unsettling.
 "Sure, Rachel tells me I'm entirely unreasonable on at least a daily basis."
 I stuck my tongue out at him, and started back through the book in search of the missing information.
 There were so many other ways I'd rather be spending our time together, but he was adamant I not fall further behind in my classes.
 I looked up to ask for a hint, and found him staring off into space.

 "I'm sorry; I didn't mean to scare you.

 I wasn't any less shocked, but his tone was so apologetic I couldn't help but smile.
 "That's better; I much prefer the happy Adri face to the scared Adri."
 "Wait, you could see me smile?
 I guess that all follows, better hearing, better sense of smell.
 Of course you'd have better vision too."

There can be no solution to the food problem without first establishing a stable medium of exchange.
 5.Macro-level policy must be complemented by micro-level change: Putting in place the right macro-level policies may be necessary, but it is far from sufficient to create a functioning market.
 The governments of the region have been so preoccupied with ‘re-engineering’ their economic and political systems and with meeting the conditions to attract foreign aid and investment that they have tended to over look the many essential and practical steps needed to implement the reforms on the ground.
 Even if governments had been able to get all the laws and economic policies ‘right’ the first time, there is no assurance that the actual impact on the people would have been less harsh than it has been.
 The so-called ‘shock therapy’ strategy pursued by these countries has been widely criticized for its severity and seeming indifference to social costs.
 But debates regarding the appropriate speed and social cost of reforms divert attention from a more fundamental problem with this approach.
 The essence of shock therapy is a reliance on macro-economic factors to bring about a radical restructuring of the economy and a radical change in the behaviour of individuals and enterprises.
 While monetary policy may prove useful for dealing with short-term adjustment problems within a relatively stable environment, there is no evidence to support its use as the principle instrument for social transition.
 Monetary variables are indicators of the functioning of an economy, but the essential factors which determine the strength and health of an economy are the productivity of its enterprises and its workforce and the material resources of the country.
 Tight monetary policy can generate intense short-term pressure for change in behaviour, but this pressure is applied indiscriminately and often with unexpected and unanticipated results.

Better to keep my secret life to myself and guard my heart than to trust somebody I was almost sure to lose---because that was how life worked---and mourn over.
 But then, in that way life has of confusing every issue, Karen invited me to be her graduation partner, which meant only walking side-by-side in a procession.
 Still I invited her to the prom.
 She accepted.
 Then a girl passed along a rumor that Liz Pence wanted to go out with me.
 Liz was a beauty.
 We dated a few times before the prom, and she would've preferred that I give Karen notice and take her instead.
 But I was neither that cold-blooded nor that stuck on Liz.
 She might be as pretty, but if she possessed any goodness like what I saw in Karen, she hid it deep.
 Prom night, for reasons more complicated than I can remember so long, Cliff was driving a '49 Ford convertible that belonged to Bob Williams, whom I will visit in Portland a few days from now.

 Those clear, deep eyes met mine for a second, seeming to look past the surface and all the way down to the bleeding mental gash that'd just triggered my most recent collapse.
 I was trying to marshal my arguments, but his eyes wiped my mind clean.
 I couldn't form another coherent thought until he shook his head and looked away.

 Against the three of us, a Forest Nymph with a powerful Black Yew bow and a Hellborn Prince of the Orqui and a warrior empowered with a Celestial Lion, are the odds truly that bad?” Rodregas stood still, surprised by Doi’van’s words.
 In truth he did not know how good or bad their odds were.
 He knew they were not good, but his mind did not spin with the odds.
 He simply focused on the rightness of Doi’van’s words.
 Trying to attack an armed keep probably had far worse odds, and for what?
 So that they could steal horses; so that they could better their odds to escape a future fight?
 Here, if they succeeded, the three would not be stealing horses, they would be freeing people from slavery.

I sat, blank-faced, staring back at him, and he turned to Ruby to give her the strangest look.
 “A hawk?” She appeared abashed for a moment and then simply shrugged, smiling.
 “Seemed to fit.” That answered his accusation and he released my hand, easing back into his chair.
 “Well, now that you’re back…” She hopped off her own chair and bounded toward the door.
 “I can’t wait to visit with our new guests.” She frowned a little.
 “Too bad they can’t stay inside with us.
 Frey can have my room, I’ll be out all night, and you can take the spare.” She took one last look at me before she rushed out, apparently satisfied with her project.
 And I was alone with Chevelle again.
 My pulse quickened and I had to remind myself he hated me.
 He was my watcher.

Here lies the real key: the insistence of the few most powerful nations on perceiving security in their own terms, and their insatiable urge to achieve ever more of it for themselves at the expense of greater insecurity for others and the world as a whole, even though their goal can never be achieved on this unilateral basis.
 During the Cold War, nuclear weapons were legitimized by the five permanent members of the Security Council which are the nuclear weapon states.
 Now that it is over, the governments of these nations seek to justify continued possession and the option to use these weapons, even while exerting every possible pressure to stop proliferation to other countries.
 The very logic which the nuclear weapon states rely on to support this policy, however, makes the acquisition of these weapons extremely attractive to non-nuclear powers.
 So long as their possession and possible use is tolerated and justified, the relatively low cost of production and high threat potential of these weapons offer strong incentives for other states to acquire them.
 It is unrealistic to expect that any system of international controls or inspections can prevent their eventual acquisition by states that decide to develop them and have the advanced scientific capabilities to do so.
 From the inception of nuclear weapons, two things have been clear.
 There can be no victors in a nuclear war and there is no credible defence against these weapons.
 Confidential studies by NATO in the 1960s concluded that the costs of a nuclear exchange to either party would be so great that the weapons were essentially unusable.
 No satisfactory answer has ever emerged for the question: where and under what circumstances can these weapons be deployed beneficially?

The full moon seemed oddly brighter than normal, edging the landscape with a silvery tracing.
 The cool illumination was strangely complemented by the warm tendrils of light trying to escape from the greenery surrounding the area.
 I let my gaze drop, and found an unearthly pool of liquid light at my feet.
 The quiet murmur of falling water to my right kindled a burning thirst I hadn't realized I'd been feeling since I opened my eyes.
 Looking towards the waterfall, I found a shimmering ribbon of light working its way down the rock face.
 The sight was so incredibly beautiful it took me several moments to realize the tendril was the waterfall I'd been looking for.
 I reached into the dancing pool of light at my feet and smiled as my cupped hands came away filled with water that lit up my palms.
 I couldn't imagine anything more surreal.
 I might have stayed there for hours if the barest whisper of sound hadn't distracted me.
 Alec was staring at me, an expression of disapproval marring otherwise perfect features.

 “This is confusing, why don't you understand that?” There was a pause.
 “I do understand; I hated it too.

 A girl was walking towards me, the same one I saw last time.
 She didn’t like it because I was staring at her, but I couldn't help it.

 I didn’t know what had happened, what was wrong with me, but I was certain whatever it was, Chevelle would take me straight back to the village.
 We stayed there for some time, a fact for which I was grateful.
 Even though whatever had happened seemed to have passed, neither man seemed in a hurry to go.
 Chevelle glanced at me occasionally but kept himself busy around the fire.
 Steed still played with his feather, eventually entertaining me with it.

She smiled, raising her lips to his for a brief kiss.
 As she wandered off, Rick focused his mind on the TV shows they'd watched last night.
 He replayed all the details of the plots, being sure that he saw, in his mind's eye, all the colors.
 Then he began thinking about planes, remembering his trip with Marie to Los Angeles.
 Then he thought about all the computer programs he used and how to troubleshoot them.
 He'd just started listing microwave products in his mind when Marie returned.
 He rose and went to hug her.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart," he said, immediately kicking himself for his hypocrisy.
 She sighed, letting herself be comforted by his embrace.
 August was just around the corner now, and she and her mother normally spent August at Cape Cod.

 I don’t really feel that comfortable with the title of ‘obsessive dirty old pervert.’  It makes me feel as if I’m getting on in years.
 Karen – How about we just shorten it to pervert?
 Art – Noooo, that doesn’t feel right to me either.

The sight was so incredibly beautiful it took me several moments to realize the tendril was the waterfall I'd been looking for.
 I reached into the dancing pool of light at my feet and smiled as my cupped hands came away filled with water that lit up my palms.
 I couldn't imagine anything more surreal.
 I might have stayed there for hours if the barest whisper of sound hadn't distracted me.
 Alec was staring at me, an expression of disapproval marring otherwise perfect features.
 "Of all the places for you to intrude, why did it have to be here?"
 For a second, surrounded as I was by such beauty, I did feel like an intruder.
 He was gorgeous, and his tan skin seemed to have the slightest hint of light playing beneath its surface.
 I was as plain and ugly as always.
 My response popped out before I could think about it.

Rodregas neither heard nor saw any activity and his physical senses were far more accurate than when he had been a young man.
 His guess was that her connection with the forest had somehow warned her that something was coming.
 Doi’van and Rodregas looked at each other as they squatted down in the shrubs.
 Doi’van had one of the Black Yew bows out, with arrows at hand, if needed.
 It would not be surprising if a patrol of the Immortal Guard would be on the road.
 The road was the main route from the port city of Chrisana Stone to the Menagerie of Sky, Earth and Water; the slave city run by the Immortalist Taiga.
 Most likely what Imeralda sensed was simply a trade caravan running a regular route from Chrisana Stone to any of several of the Eastern Realms cities.
 If it was a light scouting patrol of just two or three guards that was coming; it would be the best case scenario for them to take on some Immortalist Guards and gain better weapons, armor and horses.
 Of course, if it was a slave caravan then they would simply sit and watch, as it would be suicide to do anything against a full patrol.
 Rodregas heard a rustle in the brush and glanced over to make sure it was just a squirrel or the like.

“I went to your room and you were gone.” He shook his head.
 “I thought I had to come out here to get a search party.” “I, uh… you were in my room?” He straightened, his expression making it clear he hadn’t expected that response.
 I pressed, taking the chance.
 “Why?” I heard movement behind me and the fear returned tenfold.
 Chevelle didn’t tense; he only let out an exasperated breath.
 “It’s fine,” he said.
 He released me and I turned to see who he’d addressed.
 Four figures stood in a line, almost a formation, and they relaxed at his words.
 My arm tingled as the blood returned to the limb, freed of his harsh grip.
 Yes, he hates me.

Hopefully he’d survive it.
 Then, one day Thomas called.
 Brandon just contacted him from some street corner in a bad part of town outside of San Diego.
 Brandon said he was broke, addicted, alone and ready to commit himself to rehab.
 Thomas said he had dropped what he was doing and was driving directly to find him, as he knew Brandon might change his mind.
 Thomas said that most drug addicts would take every drug they could get their hands on if they knew they were going to rehab, and this was dangerous.
 He was off to the rescue!
 Thomas called again when he had Brandon in his car, saying while Brandon looked horrible, he was alive and on his way to a detox center, which would be followed by rehab—hopefully.
 My brother had connections at this rehab center.
 It’s a big one, called Narconon, a non-profit operated by the Church of Scientology, to which my brother belongs.

A servant once told me he heard of her extraordinary powers and beauty and sought her out, bargaining with her parents.
 I scoffed at that.
 What kind of person would trade their child?
 But now that I am older, I see.
 I see what power and greed can become.
 My doubts about the more outlandish stories, those about the obsession with power and ideas of breeding a stronger line, are gone.
 But maybe they were in love.
 Maybe she was impressed by his station, maybe she had her own ambitions.
 Or maybe she lived a nightmare and only hung on so long for her children.
 I was able to piece together some things about her life.

 Ahrqur nodded, his eyes seething.
 Velixar reached out and placed his hand on the elf’s forehead.
 Qurrah watched as smoke rose from their contact, yet neither flinched.
 When the necromancer drew back his hand, a strange symbol lay overtop the faint scarring of the slanted Y.
 It was of a fallen man wreathed in flame.
 “When you fall, the enchantment upon your forehead shall burn your body to ash.
 Then your soul may find peace.”
 “I shall do as you command,” Ahrqur said in a lifeless voice.
 “Of course,” Velixar said.

Eugene – We never actually got to the kissing point of the relationship.

 Besides, you’ll need some knowledge about such things if you ever manage to talk some girl into spending time with you.
 Johnny – Well, so what if I haven’t been out with a woman yet…
 Jim – You scare them Johnny.
 In fact you make most people uncomfortable.

Velixar’s magic had peeled the flesh from the elves’ bodies.
 Blood leaked through muscle and tendon, and their innards spilled from their abdomens.
 She hoped they died instantly, but she knew better.
 They had suffered tremendously.
 “You monster,” she shouted.
 “What meaning does this battle hold to you?”
 “Everything,” Velixar shouted, hurling a flaming ball of fire from each hand.
 “I desire panic and bloodshed all across the east!”
 Aurelia summoned a magical shield about her body.
 The fireballs thudded three feet from her body and detonated.

Stepping out of my front door and being hit by a cement truck would have been less of a surprise.

 The mayor took my shock as a sign he once again had the upper hand.
 Smiling smugly, he turned to leave, but not before I could grab at the sleeve of his sport coat.
 "Wait.

 The smirk hadn't left.
 "No, he was very clear on that point.

 Something about my vision has changed, much like it did long ago, first when I got knocked out in Las Vegas and awoke overlooking a heavenly forest, and again on the bank of the Tia Juana river the morning after a Billy Graham crusade, when the world turned brighter.
 Now, during and since my trip north, I often see people more clearly.
 I'm better at seeing God in the sorrow of a destitute fellow, one of those folks Hank Williams called "men with broken hearts", or in the patient nod of a sales clerk as I decide whether to buy a magazine, or in a woman's kind smile.
 When I need a break from work or chores, and sometimes while reading or praying, I sit on the back porch like my mom used to do.
 The view was the reason she gave for not selling the house after I left home.
 As I sit and gaze toward the Mexican border, I think of Eric, and how we used to peer through twilight and try to locate his home in the valley about five miles closer to Mexico.
 Which reminds me of Sylvia and how the cruelty of the world drove her crazy, and I wonder if turning to Jesus might have cured her, if she had let him expel her bitterness.
 Because for those who fail to discover peace and even joy in the midst of the cruelty, going mad is only sensible.

 They had two days left, and Marie chose to spend Thursday wandering around downtown Los Angeles, buying trinkets in the shops and the Farmer's Market on Fairfax and watching glamorous people walk by as she and Rick ate lunch at an outdoor café on Rodeo Drive.
 But her choice for their last day in California was quite a change from that: she wanted to go to Disneyland.

It had told of my own life, of what I was to become, a reality that would not be put to rights in my broken mind.
 But as I stared down, the assembled pieces of my shattered self held together by no more than tattered bits of string, I understood.
 This was my place.
 I heard Ruby behind me now.
 In a low voice she said, “They have heard of your return.
 They have come to see for themselves.” Their rulers had burned, along with so many of their families.
 After the massacre, there had been no one.
 From the dead, it seemed, I had returned.
 Chevelle stepped to my right side, placing something cold and heavy in my hand.

I found myself subconsciously comparing Heathcliff with Brandon during English, and Mr. Whethers had to ask me a question at least twice before I realized he was talking to me.
 I hardly even blushed at the inevitable giggles.
 I made a mental note to find out from Britney if I'd caught his question on the second or third repetition, but I rather suspected I'd forget.
 In fact, when class finally got out I remembered my question, but just didn't feel like asking.
 Instead, I just wanted to get away from her and the never-ending gossip.
 I waited until she stopped to talk to one of the cheerleaders about who was dating who, and then mumbled something about the bathroom, and made a break for it.
 Not wanting to out-and-out lie, I ducked into the nearest restroom.
 It was empty except for a mousy brunette I'd only seen a couple of times before.
 I smiled and started to open my mouth to say hi, but thought better of it.
 This was Sanctuary.

Both men glared at Harruq as he stood, but while their mouths moved and their chests heaved neither produced a sound.
 The half-orc looked to the woman shrouded in the shadows cast by the fallen torch of the patrolmen.
 “I said move along,” she said.
 “I need to give these men a talking to.”
 “I’m going,” Harruq grumbled before staggering down the alley.
 He did not attempt either stealth or silence.
 Seething, he limped back to Qurrah and their home.
 Neither said a word as he discarded his armor, tossed his swords into a corner, and crashed onto their bed of straw.
 For a long moment, only the sound of Harruq’s heavy breathing filled the room.
 “I assume things didn’t go well?” Qurrah finally asked.

 And how did he do it without being caught and sent over to the Brits for the butt-whupping that he deserved?
 Jim – I think he found the number on the internet.
 As for how he got them to answer, I think he told the servant who answered that the United States was calling to invite the queen to brunch or something.

 Who is he?
 “He told me, ‘The one will rise, the one rise!
 He will destroy you!’ That’s almost the same thing as last time.” I tapped the fountain.

Rodregas reached into the trunk but all that was left in there were a few bits of trash, a few candle stubs, some scraps of paper and a bit of cloth.
 He reached down and picked up the small piece of cloth and held it up.
 He stared for some time at the design sewn into it, and then stuck it into his outer purse.
 He had a strong urge to clean up his bunk and leave the area in the order it deserved, but that would be too big of a hint of what had happened.
 So, he was careful to leave it as it was; the longer they thought he was Ravenhurr the better.
 He then walked past the rest of the wooden cots of the barracks to the back where the captain’s room was.
 The captain’s room, unlike the outer barracks, was spotless and in perfect order.
 He searched through the captain’s pair of trunks and found some clothes that fit him, though tightly.
 The captain had been a big man but not as large as Rodregas now was.
 Still the soft linen shirt of light brown, which he knew had been loose on the captain, was much more comfortable than the wizard robe he had been wearing.

“Very well,” Harruq said.

 “I’m coming,” he said, marching after his brother.
 He hid his pain well.
 The alley opened up to the main street, running south from the center of town into the forest beyond.
 It was there that the bulk of combat had spread.
 Elves battled in the street, horribly outnumbered.

To draw a pretend place was surprisingly unsettling, but I almost couldn't blame whatever part of me had gotten confused.
 The dreams were so clear and sharp they sometimes seemed more real than the rest of my life.
 By the time I finally realized what was keeping me from getting real sleep it was too late to worry about trying to get anymore rest.
 I just stared out my window at the light the previous owners had mounted on a pole.
 It was just close enough to see an amazingly thick cloud of insects swirl around it, captivated by the artificial glow.
 When I walked downstairs I found Mom's camping equipment piled in the living room.
 For all I'd tossed and turned, I must have gotten some sleep to have not heard her come in.
 I contemplated jotting down a note before just shrugging and skipping outside, happy for once to be shivering.
 It wouldn't last.
 Eventually the sun would clear the hills, and we'd be headed for eighty-plus degrees, but I could at least enjoy the next hour or so without worrying I was going to melt right out of my clothes.

 Chapter 14: What Have I Done Wrong?
 When Brandon was about eighteen, I busted him for being stoned.
 I knew the way pot smelled, so it wasn’t any great detective work that led me to it.
 Soon after this, we discovered he had obtained a license to obtain medical marijuana.
 I was surprised.
 Turns out, it’s legal for my child (and yours) to buy, possess and grow pot and the only requirement is that they want it!
 Any little shithead can get a “medical” license to smoke marijuana in California when he turns 18.
 In fact, it’s a rite of passage, even more than a drivers’ license nowadays.
 The students hand around a list of unscrupulous doctors who are willing to do a consultation for a fee and then write a prescription for a fee so your child can go to some legal dope dispensary and buy all the “sticky-icky green bud” he or she wants.

Particular events in their life pop in and out of my head.
 Their future begins to enter my mind and I hope and pray that I will see Brandon free from his addiction one day and see Bryce graduate college.
 Who will they marry one day, how many children will they have, will I be a grandpa or a memory?
 Too many thoughts are packed in my head as I realize this is my life and my family’s life passing before me as the moment of truth approaches.
 Perhaps all this worrying is for nothing or perhaps the worst is about to happen.
 I must cleanse my mind of this sudden bombardment of thoughts and I must focus!
 I pull into the parking lot of the Starbucks just as my crack-berry rings.
 I see Ashley standing inside the coffee shop with her cell phone up to her ear.
 I answer the phone as I notice a space directly facing the front door of Starbucks is opening up as a car begins to back out.
 She asks me where I am and I tell her I am looking at her from in the truck waiting for that front spot to open.

But my day job performance suffers when my mind veers off to the stories I want to get home and write, and I suspect my stories could be richer, more passionate and imaginative, more intuitive and maybe inspired, if they didn’t always get interrupted by my day job.
 Sure, Franz Kafka was an office worker and William Blake a printer, but Kafka didn’t live very long and Blake had no kids.
 Anyway, those guys were geniuses.
 Not me.
 So I worried, would the baby help squash my writer’s dreams.
 People heard I was going to be a father again and asked, "So how old will you be when the baby turns eighteen?"
 or "What if you die?"
 She’s a girl, the doctor said, and I reasoned a girl might be quieter, a little more gentle than a boy.
 Knowing her sex made her more real.
 For the first time, I started getting pictures.

The result was a split-second close-up of her face, and the star kissed her hand.
 Marie felt as if she were going to burst from excitement.
 They were allowed to watch filming until lunch, and then they were given a tour of the rest of the studio.
 Marie heard obscenities and shouting, and she saw two different actors storm off two different sets in the middle of their scenes.
 But it was wonderful.
 The actors and actresses were very attractive people, and many of them were nice to her.
 "Today was magic, absolute magic," Marie sighed as they ate steak and salad that evening.
 Rick smiled.

That force refuses to be bound by either rationality or morality.
 Revolution means to bring future results more quickly, sooner than they would come through normal evolutionary processes.
 In earlier ages, people revolted when their most basic needs were not met, when they were denied rights or oppressed.
 Today, vast sections in developing countries are stirred to action because their expectations are not fulfilled.
 Economic liberalization has unleashed people’s expectations: witness the rush of Chinese peasants to invest in the stock market and the increasing demand of Indian villagers for a range of consumer goods.
 The same movement continues in the West as increased physical and social mobility, the growing demand for higher education and the widespread urge for greater recreation and travel.
 These expectations are the seed and driving force for social progress.
 They provide the energy and create the openness and willingness for change.
 But they also increase the danger of frustration, disappointment and violence.
 The end of the Cold War was expected to usher in an age of peace, but actually violence is on the rise in both developing and developed countries because of the widening gap between human expectations and achievements.

Positing material constraints becomes a justification for non-action.
 The true constraints are not material, but psychological and social.
 Recognizing the real barriers will help us overcome them.
 Human beings are our most creative, productive and precious resource.
 Human capacity increases the more it is drawn upon.
 It can never be exhausted.
 Developing the human resource should be the centrepiece of all development strategy.
 We can solve today’s most pressing problems if we adopt a total approach which takes into account all the interrelated factors – political, economic, technological, social and environmental – rather than relying on partial strategies.
 Partial remedies, however welcome or desirable, can always generate side-effects – such as the increase in social tensions and violence observed when increasing political and social freedom are not matched by increasing economic opportunity, or the rise in unemployment and arms exports that accompany a reduction in defence expenditure.
 The success of the Green Revolution was due to its integration of technological, institutional, commercial and public policy measures, while its short comings arose from its failure to integrate environmental factors, which are now being incorporated in agricultural development strategies.

They turned in opposite directions, each disappearing behind the trees and rocks that strewed the mountain, as I stood alone and confused.
 I sat, shaking my head as I stared down at the bark of the tree.
 Chevelle returned quickly with two small, furred animals slung over his back.
 As his gaze reached the log that lay in front of me, it burst into an orange flame, thin branches forming a spit as he skinned and attached the animals.
 The process was so smooth, I couldn’t say exactly what had happened.
 Chevelle was changing.
 Or, more likely, he was becoming more himself.
 He wasn’t as formal.
 He seemed relaxed, and apparently magic, quick and powerful, was intertwined into his every routine.
 He didn’t need to do much by hand; I would have spent hours trying to build a spit and skin an animal.

"Marie, you know that I don't approve of your going out alone."
 "Father," she sighed, turning to face him, "I'm 23 years old.
 That's certainly old enough to go into town alone."
 "Not for a decent young woman.
 Where's your mother?"
 "At a committee meeting."
 She actually would rather go shopping with her mother than alone.
 Her mother had wonderful taste but still never tried to talk her out of some of the more outlandish items she wanted to try.
 They always had a good time together, and Marie had been disappointed to find her mother gone when she awoke.
 "Call Tom then," Mr. Tranton suggested.

Chapter 23: The Where, When & Why of Drugs We talked to Brandon as often as he could and we kept in touch with the counselors weekly.
 Over the next two months we received calls from our son and his counselor as he was in the part of the program where he was assigned to come clean with his family, acknowledge his behavior, and confess to the many terrible things he had done.
 The calls were very hard on us because even though they were necessary, we felt like he was getting so much better and we were getting all this bad news about stuff in the past.
 We understood that this was a necessary part of his treatment; he needed to cleanse himself and ask for our forgiveness.
 At the end of every confession he would ask if we would accept him back into the family to which we always answered yes!
 Every time Brandon called he seemed more mentally clear.
 Brandon’s counseling had revealed several things that had caused him to bury himself in drugs and he was learning how to manage those painful experiences.
 One big event was when our son received a call from another friend of his while we were away on a family vacation.
 The friend told Brandon that his best friend, Tom, had been in a horrible car accident and was near death.
 Our son, like Tom, just sixteen years old, was hysterical, and we returned home immediately.

These things are sharp.” She moved to toss the sword to me but reconsidered and handed it over, making sure I had a good grip.
 There were intricate designs carved on the handle and runes etched in the blade.
 It wasn’t as heavy as it appeared.
 I moved it around a bit, slashing wide arcs though the chill air.
 It was pleasant, nicely balanced in my hand.
 That didn’t mean I could actually cut through someone’s neck, though.
 “Ruby, how do you intend to teach me with this?
 I mean if there’s no messing around, just lop your head off and all?” She laughed.
 “Don’t worry, Frey.
 I think I can handle you.” “I’ll do it.” Chevelle’s voice startled me.

Britney wasn't so lucky, and I caught a nasty look from her each time I surfaced from my textbook.
 The glares angered me more than I'd expected.
 I was having to catch up on a month's worth of assignments; she didn't have any right to get pissy just because she wasn't prepared.
 The third time it happened, I stopped pretending not to notice and shot Britney a sugar-sweet look of my own.
 She didn't quite seem to know how to take that and the rest of the class passed quickly.
 All too soon, it was time to go up and talk to Mrs. Campbell.
 I put off the ordeal as long as I could, waiting until everyone but Britney and I had exited the room.
 Britney looked particularly unhappy.
 Mrs. Campbell was looking at my homework when I reached her desk.
 "I was prepared to tear into you for not going to the tutoring lab last night, but that hardly seems fair seeing as how you went ahead and did the work by yourself."

She just needs some time.

 Once again it boggled my mind that they could all live with so little privacy.
 Alec interrupted my thoughts.
 "I'm sorry to have ruined your night.
 I wanted it to be perfect.
 I should have known that wasn't possible.
 Not with everything hanging over our heads."
 It felt funny to smile.
 The gesture belonged with perfect times, not ones in which people other than me were having nervous breakdowns.

Though they had all claimed rooms of their own, they were all still sleeping in the living room, partly because of the fire they kept there and partly for the company.
 They were surprised with visits by the two Dire Cats on a regular basis.
 The first evening, when they were settling into the night, the two cats casually walked through the door.
 The three of them froze while the two cats just sprawled out in casual comfort close to the fire.
 One of the cats (Rodregas had not been able to tell the two apart yet) stretched over and started to rub her chin against Rodregas’ leg.
 The power behind its head was such that it almost knocked him over.
 He had seen small house cats make similar gestures, but it was disconcerting to have two powerful predators such as the Dire Cats being so friendly.
 “I guess this means we are part of the pride,” said Imeralda, slowly reaching over and giving the other cat a tummy rub.
 Rodregas held his breath, as the cat responded with its paws by stretching out, its claws popping free with the stretch.
 They showed no signs of aggression, but just looking at the size of their claws, and then at Imeralda, made Rodregas want to jump over the Dire Cat and put his body in front of her.

I rubbed my tired arms as I rose to join them in the front room.
 “What’s going on?” I asked, though I could tell by their exchange they’d been arguing.
 Ruby grinned at me.
 “Just planning for the trip.” “Trip?” “Yes, you know, to the peak.” She was scheming.
 “Oh.” I decided I’d let them work it out, heading instead to Ruby’s room.
 “I’m going to take a bath.” As I closed the door, Ruby said, “It’s time to tell her.” I didn’t hear a response.
 I was soaking in hot water, my eyes closed, not even considering getting out when she knocked on the door.
 “What, Ruby?” She giggled.
 “How did you know it was me?” No one else is that annoying.
 “Can I come in?” “No.” The water streamed from the tub and out the back window.

The three stood there fighting to keep the horses from running and watched as the Dire Cats stepped through the main door for a moment, but left after only a short wait.
 The Dire Cats then circled the main building and went over to the far edge of the main house and then simply disappeared.
 Rodregas said, “I think they just went into the cellar of the home.
 The entrance is over there.
 Come on, let’s get the horses over to the old barn and get them set for the night before it gets too dark.” “Are those the two Dire Cats from Raven Keep?” asked Imeralda.
 As she spoke she shook her long auburn hair behind her, something he was starting to realize was a nervous gesture.
 “Yes, I think so,” Rodregas said.
 “I freed them from the dungeon before I left, and then I thought I saw them yesterday.
 Apparently, everyone in the dungeon is following me,” he said with a chuckle.
 “You saw them?” asked Doi’van.

I couldn’t help but feel sorrow for her and guilt for what I was doing but I justified it in my mind that she needed to get away from this guy and that she needed to get help for her drug problem as well.
 I pictured my son and his willingness to do anything to get his next fix.
 When I arrived at home I called Officer White’s phone and told him I had a drug deal set up with Steve and Ashley and they wanted one hundred Oxy pills.
 To say he was shocked would be an understatement.
 He wanted to know how I did this and was I sure it was Steve, as well as numerous other questions.
 I told him that he had told me he didn’t want to know anything, and I preferred to keep it that way for now.
 I did give Officer White enough information so he was sure I had the right people.
 I just needed to know when and where the narcotics squad wanted to do this deal and what I needed to do next.
 The Officer was excited at the opportunity to get this guy and he arranged me coming to the police station so I could make the call to set up the one hundred Oxy pill deal on a recorded phone line.
 The drug deal itself would happen later and I would need to be evasive and the where and the when as to the actual exchange of money for drugs.

 He looked concerned but I'd learned to read his expressions better than I think he realized.

 It was a lot for someone our age to deal with.
 "There's an uncommon amount of that going around right now."
 Alec shook his head at my curious stare.

After a few moments he turned to face her.

 After all, you stared at me all morning."
 "That's different," he muttered, glancing away.
 "Why?"
 When he didn't answer, she took his hand, lacing her fingers with his.
 "They tried to make a game of picking me up and throwing me into the waves, but I wouldn't let them.
 I didn't let them touch me.

If Imeralda had missed something critical and they should not attack, it was for Doi’van to catch.
 Rodregas watched Doi’van, watched for him to raise the bow and start the fight.
 When the guards charged in to stop the shooting, then it would be his turn to strike.
 Rodregas would have to take on as many of the slavers and guards as possible.
 It would do little good to get caught up in a one-on-one battle; the odds were too many against them.
 He had to use his new strength and speed and go after multiple targets.
 Rodregas focused on his breathing, he needed his body ready.
 He rested his body against the tree, trying not to tense up, and breathed deep and slow.
 Quicker than he thought, Doi’van’s black bow came up and he started to shoot.
 The Black Yew bows were an incredible advantage, they had been the pride of Raven Keep and were among the most dangerous and rare weapons that the Nymphs used to protect themselves.

Government agencies can tap the potentials of agriculture, identifying new commercial opportunities, educating farmers, demonstrating new potentials, assisting in the transfer and dissemination of new technology, and promoting the establishment of effective organizations – preferably privately or co-operatively owned by farmers or at least with their participation – to process, distribute and market what is produced.
 Coping with the environmental problems to preserve the ecological foundations essential for sustainable agriculture is an area in which government has special responsibilities and must play a leading role on an ongoing basis.
 Regulating the diversion of prime farm land for non-farm uses, expansion of irrigation capacity, control of groundwater exploitation, major programmes for reforestation and to prevent or reverse desertification, and regulation of pesticide use can only be effectively planned, monitored and regulated by governments.
 Comprehensive Strategies
 In this and previous chapters, we have tried to present an integrated perspective of the political, economic and technological factors that need to be taken into account in formulating a comprehensive approach to the issues of peace, food and employment.
 In an effort to illustrate the potential efficacy of this approach in a country representing nearly 25 per cent of the world’s poor, ICPF conducted an in-depth country level study in India to evolve a strategy for stimulating massive increases in job growth and food production (see box pp.
 122–24).
 PROSPERITY 2000 STRATEGY FOR INDIA
 The potential for accelerating job creation and increasing food production through a mix of the strategies discussed in this report is illustrated by the strategy which ICPF has proposed to achieve full employment in India and thereby to raise the entire population above the poverty line by generating additional employment opportunities for 100 million persons in the coming decade.
 This strategy utilizes agriculture as an engine for growth by accelerating the development of commercial agriculture, agro-industry and agro-exports.

We need the organizational know-how to create effective administrative and political systems in transition states and to restructure international institutions.
 We require enormous investments in constructive economic activities – as opposed to lavish arms spending – to generate jobs and higher incomes for hundreds of millions of people in the developing world, and by extension to stimulate further economic growth and job creation in the West.
 All these essential ingredients are available in abundant measure, if only we choose to employ them for our common benefit.
 Yet even this is not enough.
 Otherwise, we would already have accomplished many of our goals.
 Above and beyond these material, social and financial resources, we need a new vision, a new perspective and new attitudes about what can and must be done.
 If the events of the past seven years prove anything, it is that a massive change of attitude and perspective, such as the one brought about between East and West, is imminently possible and incredibly powerful.
 The one we have all been party to has immensely altered the world’s political and economic landscape – sweeping away at a single stroke the very real danger of another world war and widespread nuclear destruction.
 The recommendations formulated in this report call for profound changes in the way we think, feel and act to meet the challenges and tap the opportunities of the coming decade.
 We should not underestimate the magnitude of the changes required or the collective effort needed to bring them about.

He sat down, drawing her into his arms.
 His embrace made her feel secure enough to swallow her fear.
 When her breathing had returned to normal, she pulled back to look into his eyes.
 "I want to go home."
 "OK."  He stroked her hair.
 "Why don't you close your eyes and just think about home?
 I won't touch you or say a word."
 "All right."
 She closed her eyes and began thinking about Davis and how it felt to dance with him.
 She thought about her mother and father and brother and how they'd laughed and talked at meals before her brother had been disowned.

 “I let you down at the creek.” His gaze fell to my hands, which closed instinctively into fists, protecting the newly-scarred palms.
 “I was distracted.

 I should have prevented this.” Regret was thick in his voice.
 I could only stare at him, mystified.

 Alec shook his head.

She'd never worn such a thing.
 When she put it on, she found that it fit her like a tent.
 But oddly enough, she liked it.
 The big bathrobe almost reached her ankles, and she felt quite comfortable as she picked up her dress and wet clothing and went across the hall to the bedroom.
 She found hangers in the closet and hung her clothes there.
 But once she was in bed, the dreamlike feeling dissolved.
 She was far, far away from home, in a strange place, and she didn't know if she'd ever get back.
 Tears trickled down her cheeks as she drew her knees up under the covers, her back against the headboard.
 She was too frightened to go to sleep.
 Walking in the garden was no longer safe--was sleeping?

 “I’ll see you tomorrow,” she said, taking a hesitant step toward the trees.
 “Sure thing,” Harruq said, rubbing the tear off his cheek and pretending it had not been there.

 Tears were on her cheeks as well, but she left them alone.

See that coming and, walloped by dread reality, spooked beyond reach of old customs and authority, our nature cries, “It’s out there somewhere, whatever it is.
 Go find it.” Eric and I bought Kerouac’s On the Road, and checked out Dharma Bums and his latest, Big Sur, a memoir in minimal disguise, about a fellow who goes to a cabin in the forest to recover from drunkenness and fame.
 Imagine Henry David Thoreau as a neurotic who returns to Walden Pond and finds psychosis awaiting him there.
 Still, we concluded that a poet of Kerouac's passion and skill, who could make a hangover feel romantic, would pull out of his tailspin and rise again.
 That fall, Eric and I read most every day, then sat in my backyard or on a beach or sea cliff and talked for hours at a spell.
 Also, we worked at odd jobs, sold some possessions, and saved most of whatever our moms gave us.
 We needed gas money, so we could chase visions of Kerouac and his Beat pals through the places they haunted at the west end of their cross-country odysseys.
 Twice that fall, the minute school let out on Friday, we sped north on Highway 101.
 From Morro Bay to Santa Cruz, we followed the coast and made camp for the night on a cliff between Hearst Castle and Big Sur.
 Saturday, midmorning, we landed in North Beach, San Francisco.

Like streams of water, it flowed from his hands, splashing across the roof and setting it ablaze.
 Finished, he ran for an alley to hide as the fire gained the attention of the many patrols.
 He heard footsteps and shouts further down the road so he ducked left, running in between homes as all around the shouts grew louder.
 The houses ended, and like a fleeing thief he burst out into the streets only to slam into a drunken man holding a small bottle.
 The two rolled, a tangle of legs and arms.
 The small bottle shattered.
 “What the abyss are you…” the man started to say, but Qurrah’s hand pressed against his lips.
 “Your voice or your life,” Qurrah said, danger flaring in his eyes.
 The half- orc pushed him away and got to his feet.
 He glanced around, trying to orientate himself, when he felt a sharp pain stab into his back.

“I imagined what it was like to fight that creature.
 And then my body took over.” He explained, but I don’t think he even understood.
 Then he was gone again and the real Seth stood up.
 “Try it.” I closed my eyes and thought of school and all of Ms. Stecher’s homework that I needed to do.
 Then my body was doing the rest.
 I felt hot and cold, as the winds seemed to pick up.
 I shivered and opened my eyes.
 I was lying on the ground.
 My hair brown hair flopped in my face as I sat up, seeing Emily dash over to me.
 Seconds later Jason walked through the trees, rubbing his face.

When he really pushed the issue, his house mysteriously caught on fire."
 My mouth was hanging open, but Britney seemed to think it was disbelief rather than amazement.
 "I'm serious, Adriana, and I'm not letting you take my family down with you.
 Find your own way home."
 Chapter 6 There was no reason for Britney's actions to come as any kind of surprise, it was exactly in keeping with her character.
 Even if she didn't believe a word of what she'd just told me, I really was on my way to becoming a social pariah, and her whole existence centered around becoming more popular.
 Even so, knowing I was officially stranded at school with no way home felt very much like the end of the world.
 We still didn't have a phone, and probably wouldn't for weeks to come, even assuming we somehow managed to keep our home through the end of the week.
 Calling Mom and asking her to come and get me was out.
 Presumably if I waited long enough Mom would decide something was wrong and come looking for me.

And Coltrane—everyone wanted to play like Coltrane, who credited acid with some of his wilder stuff—the stuff that was so influential.
 Pretty soon it was right there on albums, you know—psychedelia, via the laboratory.
 Psychedelic rock was just acid put to music, you know.
 Suddenly there were drug songs.
 “White Rabbit.”  “Amphetamine Annie.” “She Said She Said,” supposedly.
 Everyone thinks “Open Channel D” is about turning on, man, but, no, no, you get the reference.
 I mean, sure, open your mind, yeah, that’s psychedelia’s code-word.
 I wrote “Strawberry Fields for a While” on acid, appropriately.

My pulse sped at the idea that he might be going to her, to get her help in finding me.
 If he was my watcher, I’d be his responsibility, and she was the only one who knew me at all aside from Fannie.
 He was a good fifty yards farther as I considered.
 My feet were moving before I’d actually decided to follow him.
 My determination faltered.
 How far should I go?
 What if he wasn’t going to find Junnie?
 And then I thought, What else do you have to do, sit here and blow up frogs?
 It was all the convincing I needed.
 Slinking out from the branches of the spruce, I crept low along the trees and brush as I followed my watcher north.

Both races of elves fear for their existence.
 Celestia has grown distant to her clerics.
 Mankind breeds like mice while the elves find themselves gradually dwindling.
 A man fighting an elf is like a grain of sand blowing against a stone, yet strong winds and fields of sand can reduce the sturdiest of boulders to dust.”
 “What are we to do?” Qurrah asked.
 Velixar looked at him and smiled.
 “Kill the messenger and the guards that accompany him.
 Vaelor will be furious at the death of family, however distant.
 He will have every excuse to war with the elves and we will exploit that war to our purposes.”

It took the end of the world to renew their friendship.
 On a Friday night at my house we watched a movie called On the Beach.
 It began with a nuclear war.
 The human race died from north to south, until all that remained of humanity were some outposts in Australia, where foreign Navy ships had anchored.
 One by one the heroes expired, while the band played “Waltzing Matilda.” Cliff asked if we would go running with him on the cross-country course at Balboa Park, near downtown San Diego, where the previous year he had scored his only first-place finish.
 He wanted to run there one last time, before the end of the world.
 We parked on a mesa overlooking Balboa Stadium, to which Billy Graham would come later that year.
 We set off jogging through the dark canyons and oak groves, alongside the zoo where tropical night birds hooted and the gibbons chattered as though outraged.
 I huffed and panted while Cliff and Eric bounded as if every stride was downhill, yet for 2.3 miles I managed to keep up and sing along with our chorus of “Waltzing Matilda.” From then on, for us, to be on the beach meant something new.
 Besides tumbling through the waves, watching girls who filled us with trepidation and awe, dreaming of far places and freedom, it meant staring at the opaque sheen of eternity.

 He nodded but said nothing.
 The two traveled in between the hills, exhausted but unwilling to stop their movement.
 “Why did you fight the elves?” she asked when their silence had stretched for more than half an hour.
 “It’ll be a long story,” he said.
 “We have time.”
 He chuckled.
 “Aye, I guess we do.”
 He told her of Velixar and his plans.
 He told her of the strength, weapons, and armor granted to him.

The bath refreshed me but, unfortunately, it also cleared my mind.
 No wonder Ruby drugged me.
 I tried not to think about the tracker as I dressed.
 The smell of cold and morning hung in the air and I felt a pang of guilt at using the fragrance again, knowing Chevelle would be there.
 I appraised myself in the mirror and smiled, and then shook my head, certain the dust was still influencing me.
 When I walked into the main room, Chevelle was sitting on the bench seat, leaning over as he worked on something.
 He raised his head as I approached, closing his hand around whatever it was before sliding it into a pocket.
 He seemed mildly anxious.
 I was still feeling peculiar so I climbed into the seat beside him, curling my feet up close.
 He watched me, his eyes lingering even after I had settled.

She might be as pretty, but if she possessed any goodness like what I saw in Karen, she hid it deep.
 Prom night, for reasons more complicated than I can remember so long, Cliff was driving a '49 Ford convertible that belonged to Bob Williams, whom I will visit in Portland a few days from now.
 Cliff's date was Chris Latin.
 Karen and I rode in the back seat.
 Karen had a cold.
 Maybe her reason for keeping her distance, physical and otherwise, was hygienic concern for my health.
 Or maybe she didn't approve of my dating Liz.
 Whatever the truth, she wounded my already tenderized feelings.
 For a while during the after-prom at a bowling alley, I left her and found Margaret.

His pack too of course, but most importantly, I'd finally know more of what made Alec Graves tick.
 A couple of hours later at lunch, Mrs. Campbell had met the appearance of Rachel, Alec, and the rest of the pack with a raised eyebrow and a disbelieving headshake, but simply motioned them all over to the other side of the room, and handed me my test.
 Despite having spent weeks preparing for my makeup exam, I was still a little nervous until I started working the first problem.
 Forty minutes later I handed Mrs. Campbell a completed test, and got the extreme pleasure of watching her grade it and write a large, crimson 'A' on the front page.
 I was so excited I nearly squealed in delight.
 I managed to restrain myself, just barely, only to giggle as Rachel dropped her lunch and squealed for me.
 Dominic's gentle smile wasn't quite as enthusiastic, but I already knew her subdued reaction wasn't any less heartfelt.
 Throw in Jasmin's congratulations, which seemed to indicate the passing grade had been nothing less than inevitable, with Alec taking my hand as soon as I sat down, and Jessica and James' lack of response didn't matter at all.
 With Isaac's reassuring presence at my side in History, I weathered the renewed gossip, apparently occasioned by the entire pack's absence during lunch for the second day in a row, and soon found myself reunited with Alec in Physics.
 As luck would have it, Mrs. Alexander was gone again, and the substitute was typically clueless about what we were supposed to be doing.

“For death and power,” Qurrah whispered.
 “For Karak,” Velixar corrected.
 “When can I meet your brother?”
 The half-orc shrugged.
 While he seemed calm, the man in black did not miss how his eyes still refused to meet his.
 “Give me time,” Qurrah said.
 “Let me make sure he is ready.”
 “Is he not open to Karak?” Velixar asked.
 “He is open,” Qurrah said a bit too vehemently.
 A glare from Velixar calmed him before he continued.

My head turned with the contact, whipping back toward her before I had a chance to rein in the shock and anger.
 Fannie’s eyes lit with anticipation.
 Like she wanted me to fight back.
 I had never even talked back to Fannie.
 I didn’t have the size to fight her, let alone the magic.
 And she was conniving.
 When I’d first come to live with her she had sent me to Council repeatedly, complaining of my behavior.
 I had undergone hours of “evaluations” under the scrutiny of Council members.
 Exams and trials and endless questions.

And we sat so, tucked in the narrow space behind a small library table, for hours.
 He pulled books between us and returned them to the shelves, never once glancing at the papers spread out beside us referencing the northern clans.
 Nothing we studied touched on the histories of those clans.
 Nothing of his histories, nothing of mine.
 But conversation had become easy as soon as I had spoken that first word, as soon as I had said his name and he’d smiled in return.
 I found myself leaning toward him as he spoke, actually paying attention in places; he had a pleasant voice and an unusual dialect.
 He wove histories as if they were stories of his childhood friends instead of useless facts, and I became enthralled.
 It felt as if we were alone there in the quiet corner of the third level, the occasional murmur below and whisper of flipping pages the only other sound in the dim setting.
 A small knothole made a window in the wall across from me and some light from the cloudy day occasionally came through, putting Chevelle’s face in shade.
 I had been right; his eyes appeared nearly black in the shadows.

 The half-orc endured the gaze, concentrating fully on his grass-removing project.

Ironically, Brandon was working the detox center on the day of his one-year anniversary of sobriety.
 Brandon told us that it suddenly struck him as he sat on the bathroom floor comforting a young man as he convulsed and withered in pain.
 Brandon was the young man on the floor twelve months ago and he had no idea who comforted him that day but he remembered his compassion well.
 He had evolved in a short year from the position of a detoxing addict receiving compassion to the position of a former addict providing compassion.
 Brandon is giving back!
 Brandon considers the staff and students his second family.
 We don’t see Brandon often because he works in the “boonies” many hours away but we talk to him almost every night.
 He usually calls us late after his shift ends around 11 pm.
 My wife and I put him on the speaker phone when he calls so we can both share his day with him.
 He has no car so he walks about one mile back on the shoulder of the narrow country road in Werner Springs as he talks to us.

Harruq pointed past the army to where a long line of men stood in the distance, carrying no light or torch.
 “What are they doing?” he asked.
 Qurrah searched the line, and he saw what he suspected.

 “Those alongside him are dead, Harruq.
 They serve only him.”
 “Huh,” Harruq said.
 “Lot of good he’s doing.

After I rounded a few houses, I cut back toward the village center.
 I wasn’t doing anything wrong, but I didn’t want to flaunt it.
 I had no good reason for researching Chevelle Vattier, except I had been thinking about him all day.
 You just met him this morning.
 Not even met.
 Stared at.
 Heat crept into my cheeks for no good reason, and I picked up my pace to the old tree that housed the library.
 I knew my shoulders were drawn in and I was glancing around too often, but I couldn’t seem to help it.
 It felt illicit.
 Twice I imagined a set of dark eyes on me, a pricking sensation running over my spine.

They were both very addicted to cocaine and I guess they belonged together because neither one of them belonged with me.
 I went to her apartment where I caught them together.
 I beat him within an inch of his life in front of her.
 Karen and her roommate did everything they could to pull me off of him but my rage for his complete abandonment of our friendship in so many ways had escalated to the perfect storm.
 It seemed he had taken everything from me and he had been my closest friend for the last six years and I snapped.
 This was a defining moment in my life, where I began to truly understand what drugs could make you do.
 Pete and Karen later married, had a couple of kids and, in his late twenties, Pete died of a heroin overdose.
 I moved to the south side of the lake and began selling radio advertising.
 I still called Thomas in Sacramento often, as family is family, and he was about all I had left in that category and he was all I had growing up.
 He was my big brother and there was no changing that.

But although in reality both systems are dead, the ideology of the capitalist system lives on and casts an illusory impression of supremacy.
 Rather than searching for a victor and vanquished, the urgent need is to find a successor that combines and synthesizes the enlightened values of both systems – freedom and equality, liberty and security.
 It has been amply proved that the authoritarian state is incapable of exerting a benevolent authority over the people without imposing severe restrictions on freedom, stifling human energy and creativity, leading sooner or later to rising discontent and a loss of social vitality.
 It is also abundantly clear that money as an institution operating through the free pricing mechanism of the market system – although it does succeed in generating high levels of energy, creativity and productivity – regards people as a purchasable commodity or a potential market, but is otherwise indifferent to human values and welfare.
 Neither the determinism of the state nor the determinism of the market can be adequate in themselves to achieve the goals of peace and prosperity that we strive after.
 It has been generally assumed that the transition now taking place in Eastern Europe will sooner or later lead these countries to adopt forms of government and economy identical to those prevalent in the West.
 But for those raised in a society that offered a great measure of social security, the poverty and insecurity of the Western system are gross inadequacies.
 While it is clear that these new democracies have rejected the authoritarian statist system, it is not yet clear what finally they will accept, discover or invent as a more acceptable alternative.
 The creativity and inventiveness they have exhibited in seeking an alternative in the past may quite possibly lead them to discover that better social system which both East and West are in need of.
 Viewed from an evolutionary perspective, we may surmise the general direction and likely destination of that quest.

Ice spread from house to house, walling Velixar off on the other side.
 “From dirt to ice?” Velixar asked.
 “The end is just the same!”
 The center of the wall exploded inward, but this time Aurelia was prepared.
 A rolling thunder of sound shoved all the broken shards forward, sending even the remaining chunks of the wall down the street in a chaotic assault.
 Velixar grinned.
 Clever girl.
 The wave of sound and ice slammed his body.
 He flew backward, ice tearing his skin, but no blood came forth from those wounds.
 The larger pieces smashed his body from side to side, which turned limply with each blow.

 I listened as plans were made for a trade, Steed agreeing to bring in the herd so Chevelle would be able to choose in the morning.
 They kept talking, settling into conversation.
 Steed offered Chevelle what was left of the roast and they sat, Chevelle beside me and Steed across from us.
 I picked up the canteen and choked down more wine.
 The evening carried on and though the conversation still held a formal tone, neither man talking of anything personal, they seemed to be getting along.

 Alec came back towards us with an air of resignation.
 Mallory tenderly accepted the letter he produced from a pocket somewhere, and then waited while Alec knelt in front of her.
 I felt a tingle of power as Mallory reached out and placed her hands on either side of his face.
 The power surged, and Alec's heavy, cool power was joined by something light and laughing.
 Several seconds later, Mallory released Alec with a sigh and fell back in obvious exhaustion.
 Alec watched intently until she shook her head, and then the mask fell for just a second before he locked it back in place, hiding the disappointment that for the slimmest of moments had been plainly written on his expression.
 Mallory reached out, as if to take Alec's hand, but he gently set her hands back on her lap.

She walked as though she ruled the castle, not as if she were a light elf in the center of a dark lord’s rule.
 She confessed to me a secret her family held, a power I had not known from my mother.

 She passed to me many details of her sister, of the family… my family.

Johnny, you’ve never had a date in your life, and some times I doubt that you ever will.
 And Gene, well I don’t know where to start with you, the last time you went out with someone was during that week that you thought you might be gay.
 Now I’m not an experienced judge of what makes another guy attractive, but I would have to say that your date was the single ugliest man I’ve ever seen in my life.
 Eugene - Frank was not ugly, well he was ugly, but he was a nice guy and a good friend.
 Jim – And let me guess, a good kisser.
 Eugene – We never actually got to the kissing point of the relationship.
 Johnny – I didn’t want to know that!
 Jim – And that’s why it’s so damned funny.

A 20X20 room covered in egg-cartons.
 The preternatural silence beforehand.
 The prelude.
 The creation of something new.
 From where there was nothing something now exists: songs, recordings, an album.
 The making of Turntable Poison was a liminal time, a time of congruity, or grand passion.
 The melding of the three (sometimes four) musicians was a Synchronicity.
 It can happen more than once but it happened at least once for Black Lung.
 It’s there on that vinyl circle, waiting for the needle like a junkie.
 And for anyone lucky enough to find that masterpiece in someone’s garage sale, in some second-hand record shop (where I hear it can go for upwards of a hundred dollars or more), at some friend’s apartment, there is knowledge passed.

 The words were innocent enough, but there was something in his eyes that made a rush of warmth shoot through me.
 Britney was so excited she could hardly speak, but I was too excited myself to feel very superior.
 I floated through my next class, and would've gone through the rest of the day the same way, if I hadn't had to share a class with Alec.
 Still, I was so happy that even Alec's giving me the cold shoulder didn't completely sour my day.
 Rachel had turned my illness into something really cool, and Brandon really did like me.
 Life couldn't get much better than this.
 Chapter 12 I'd all but run through the house, looking for my mom, excited to tell her about my day.
 Instead I'd been greeted by nothing but half-filled boxes and silence.
 I didn't really want to unpack, but it was long past needing to be done and I knew if I left it to Mom that we'd never really get moved in.

The wood blackened, smoke billowed from his hands, and then the entire building erupted as if bathed in oil.
 Qurrah laughed, untouched by the heat.
 He could not say the same for the elves, and as their pained screams reached his ears he only laughed louder.
 The half-orc ran as people flooded the streets, calling out for buckets and water.
 Too many homes were aflame.
 They could no longer cower within them and hope to be spared.
 In the commotion, Qurrah vanished, unseen and uncared for.
 He had spent his whole life disappearing in crowds, and in the dark of night, surrounded by fear and worry, he was just a shadow.

*** Seth opened his eyes and curled up, retching.
 He took in deep, shaky breaths and laid back, staring up.
 He narrowed his eyes and saw a small spot of light.
 What the heck?
 He was underground, in a cave.
 He groaned and sat up, his back throbbing.
 His head was pounding so hard he had to close his eyes to keep from passing out.

Comprehensive Strategies
 While most of the prescriptions listed above are known to all, very few are systematically and efficiently applied.
 Africa can benefit enormously by applying strategies that have worked in Asia.
 The ‘Prosperity 2000’ programme evolved by ICPF for India and presented in the next chapter seeks to utilize a combination of these strategies to generate 100 million new jobs within a decade or less, which will be sufficient to raise 25 per cent of the world’s poorest billion people above the poverty line.
 Given a comprehensive approach, the right mix of policies, good government and a conducive international environment for trade, technology transfer and investment, every nation has the capacity to develop and meet the employment needs of its people within the next one or two decades.
 The Right to Employment
 The transformation of social life in this century has drawn hundreds of millions of people away from a subsistence level existence in agriculture to urban areas and industrial employment.
 In the process it has brought about an unprecedented advancement in living standards around the world.
 But it has also engendered a way of life in which the livelihood of individuals is far more dependent than in the past on external conditions – the state of the national and global economy, trade policies, interest and exchange rates, levels of military spending and overall consumer demand.
 Modern society, even in the most liberal democracies, has become so structured that it leaves less and less freedom for truly independent individual initiative.

The flippant, humorous nature of his response was so atypical, and yet still quintessentially Alec.
 I nearly broke into a fit of laughter that would've gotten us both in even more trouble with Mrs. Sorenson.
 I roll my eyes at you...a lot.
 So once you're done, I get to ask you any question?
 No restrictions?
 That was nearly a deal breaker, I could see it by the way his initial smile at my 'rolled eyes' faded away into his more characteristic seriousness.
 He contemplated his response for a good fifteen seconds, which was probably something like two hours in shape shifter time, before finally touching his pen to the paper again and then passing my notebook back.
 It's a deal.
 When I finish up with my questions, you can ask whatever you want.
 Of course if your question is something that's going to get you into trouble, I reserve the right to pack you onto a plane and send you off to safety once I'm done answering.

The class was quiet for several seconds, before a hand finally shot up.
 I could have predicted who it would be.
 Every class has at least one teacher's pet.
 Some of the kids end up that way because they have this bizarre thirst for knowledge, some go that route because they like to make everyone else look stupid.
 Sammy was in the latter group.
 She'd probably been saving a question about light since we'd started the unit.
 Just in case an opportunity presented itself to earn some brownie points.
 "Mrs. Alexander, I read something about water around reactor cores giving off a blue light.

In Minnesota you could always pick out the alpha females by the length of their shorts, and this one seemed to think she was at the top of the food chain.
 That or a complete slut, but with her tan skin and perfect wavy hair, I figured it was probably the former.
 She didn't look like she had to put out to get attention.
 Two minutes later, a smiling blond secretary came waddling out of what was probably the principal's office.
 I spent the time wondering if I should try to make small talk; the gorgeous girl spent it staring out the window.
 The secretary took in the two of us, frowned almost imperceptibly at the length of the shorts and then signed a form for the other girl.
 Determined to at least try and make friends, I started to smile as she turned towards me on her way out, but the expression died as soon as I met her flat green eyes.
 My heart immediately started to race, but she was already gone, moving with grace and confidence out of the suddenly too-small office.
 I'd expected some degree of cliquishness from such a small-town, but this was bad.
 I'd never seen her before, so there wasn't any way it could be some kind of misunderstanding.

Now, it is my turn to ask a question.” “Actually,” interrupted Rodregas, “you already asked me about being an old soldier.
 Let me answer that first.
 I was a sergeant in Ravenhurr’s guard and I am afraid I have become what I learned to hate more than anything, an Immortalist.” Rodregas paused and took a deep breath.
 What he said next was hard even for himself to say, “In truth, I am an old man who had his time on this world and did not do much with it.
 But now I have stolen the body of a very promising young man.
 I will die feeling guilty for what I have done, but I plan to take a few of you with me.
 Now, it is my turn for a question,” he said.
 Rodregas hoped that Imeralda would do whatever she was going to do soon; the conversation was escalating and he did not think they had much time before things got deadly.
 Rodregas asked, “Why did the Immortalist Taiga capture my friend Doi’van and keep him in his Menagerie of Earth, Sky and Fire for two years before selling him to Ravenhurr?
 He is a Hellborn and should have been of no interest to those trying to become Celestial Gods.” Van’dret became very still at this question, for a long moment he neither moved nor spoke.

For me, will you not?”
 It seemed all the forest paused, listening for the answer.
 “Harruq, I love you.
 But I also love my home.
 I love my brethren.”
 She stood on her toes and gave him a quick, soft kiss on his lips.
 A tear ran down Harruq’s cheek as he stood in shock.
 His mind relished the soft feel of her lips on his, the scent of flowers, and the subtle fire that had escaped onto his tongue.
 “I’ll see you tomorrow,” she said, taking a hesitant step toward the trees.
 “Sure thing,” Harruq said, rubbing the tear off his cheek and pretending it had not been there.

Anxiety regarding the impact of technological development on jobs has been aggravated by the belief – largely a hangover from the Industrial Age – that in the industrial nations automation is rapidly replacing high-wage manufacturing jobs with low-wage jobs in the service sector.
 Actually, services have had a dominant place in Western economies for most of the twentieth century.
 In the United States, they now account for 79 per cent of all jobs, 74 per cent of GDP, and generate a $56 billion trade surplus, compared to a $132 billion deficit for goods.
 Technological developments, such as advances in computers, telecommunications and medical technology, have played at least as great a role in the growth of the service sector as in manufacturing.
 New service jobs in banking, foreign trade, research, design and engineering, computer software, education, health, law, finance, business management, communications, transportation, media and entertainment demand higher levels of education and skills and offer higher pay.
 In 1992 the median manufacturing job in the US paid only $19 per week more than the median job in the service sector.
 The growth of technology is freeing workers from the drudgery of the production line, while providing consumers with a quality of life previously available only to the most wealthy.
 The organization of production is also a major determinant of the number of jobs created.
 The Western pattern of mass production by monolithic corporations that emerged during the first 80 years of this century is no longer the inevitable or even the obvious pattern for either industrial or developing countries in the coming decades.
 Smaller, technology-intensive firms are faster at adapting new technology, more flexible in meeting specialized customer needs and generate more skilled, better-paying jobs.

As long as there isn't any kind of public fight with massive amounts of bloodshed, I probably wouldn't know that everyone is at each other's throats, but Donovan seems happy.
 He's always pleasant."
 The expression on Mallory's face tugged on my heartstrings.
 The open vulnerability there made me cast about for additional tidbits to tell her.
 "He's one of my favorites.
 Rachel and I were already friends, so it made sense that she'd be nice to me, and Dominic at least knew who I was, but Donovan was nice to me right from the start.
 It's almost like he approves of me where some of the others aren't so sure Alec's dating me is a very good idea."
 Mallory's expression was far away as she spoke.
 "Yes, he would approve of the two of you.
 He's the consummate man servant, so very professional that you probably wouldn't ever know it if he didn't like you, but I'm sure he does.

 Her fear had returned.
 Not fear of being stuck in 2011 but of spending the day without Rick.
 What would she do?
 She showered while Rick did the same in his bathroom, and she washed her hair with some shampoo she found on the edge of the tub.
 It smelled nice, and she found herself wishing for some perfume or some bath oil.

She was probably worried I'd go back to how I was immediately after it all happened.
 I'd lost a couple of weeks there, alternately triggering a panic attack and then thinking about Dad or Cindi until the immunity wore off and another attack ensued.
 Mom had flipped out.
 I'm not sure what brought me out of that black hole.
 I think maybe it was when I looked out the window one day and realized I'd somehow missed fall.
 Fall had always been Dad's favorite time.
 Cindi's had been spring--she hadn't minded the mud.
 My immunity was wearing off; the racing heart was a sure sign.
 I focused back in on what Mom was saying.

Chapter Seven Steed
 The early morning sun streaked through every break in the makeshift door, lighting the entirety of the hollow.
 I considered covering my head with that damp dress and sleeping the rest of the day, but my stomach ached for food and Chevelle might not be far behind.
 I crawled out, rubbing and squinting my eyes, and was able to locate a few roots and greens.
 It would have to be enough to tide me over until I could figure out a way to hunt.
 After knocking the brush away from my shelter, I slung the pack over my shoulder and trudged north once more.
 There was an abundance of streams running through the hills, and a few patches of fat, amethyst berries along the way, so I couldn’t complain.
 And the route was undemanding; the ground was smooth, nothing too overgrown to make passage difficult, none of those nasty snarls that could form from a maze of thorn trees or the network of vines that could tangle your legs.
 The grass was tall, but soft, so it rolled over, hiding no more than the occasional field mouse or vole.
 Sporadic wildflowers dotted the hills, small sprays of pinks or spiky yellowbird.

“No elf will save you.

 “Why this hatred?” she asked, smacking away a dual thrust.
 “When have I shown you anything but kindness?”
 Harruq gave her no answer.
 Instead, he stabbed with Salvation, a higher thrust of Condemnation trailing behind it.
 Aurelia turned her staff horizontal and pushed upward.
 Both swords stabbed high above her head.
 A quick turn and one end of her staff rammed the half-orc in the gut.
 The blow knocked the wind out of Harruq.

At least I didn't have to listen to all of the gossip during lunch.
 Once I'd been able to hobble down the stairs, I'd made my way to Mr. Whethers' room, and I'd spent the entire lunch break studying.
 I hadn't been especially excited at the prospect of spending that long by myself, but the cafeteria was all the way on the other side of the school.
 Limping over there listening to Vincent run his mouth and then coming all the way back here for History wouldn't be worth it.
 History being what it was, I probably heard about as much in that one hour as most everyone else did during the whole rest of the day.
 Mr. Simms seemed especially dense, and pretty much let everyone do whatever they wanted for the entire class.
 In deference to my new dedication to academic excellence, I finished up the reading, and then opened up my Biology book and started trying to get a handle on all of the items I'd thought I understood, but apparently hadn't.
 When the bell rang I limped back to my locker before making my painful way to Physics.
 I almost turned around and left when I saw the substitute again, but almost two decades of ingrained respect for authority figures propelled me into the room and to my seat.
 I happened to look up at the exact moment that Alec appeared in the doorway.

Over the years, Thomas had conned me out of thousands of dollars.
 He had an uncanny ability to put together some huge deal making himself absurd amounts of money and then blowing it all on a high roller lifestyle followed by being completely broke and desperate and addicted to drugs again and again.
 Thomas had also conned or borrowed thousands of dollars from mutual friends and associates, and it was not uncommon for my wife and me to be confronted by angry people in restaurants or public places because my brother owed them money.
 The last straw with Thomas was over Christmas many years back when he became so violent and threatening that Lisa and I decided to not see him or his family again.
 We even told our children that if Uncle Thomas came to our house or ever tried to get them in a car that they were to run to any other adult.
 We did not know what drug he was on or how far he would go.
 When he moved to southern California, we were not faced with Thomas’s problems anymore.
 I crossed him off of my list—the brother who had stood shoulder to shoulder with me through all the moves, the abuse, and so much else.
 The brother who for a while was all I had was completely estranged from me.
 I had put Thomas in a similar category as my biological Father, Richard.

 Still, as disappointing as it was that the performers were only barely going to be visible, it wasn't as bad as the nagging worry that Rachel wasn't coming after all.
 We'd spent almost every second together talking about how much fun we were going to have seeing Les Misérables together.
 She'd even still been excited about the bus ride.
 Given everything she'd said, I'd anxiously waited for her to show up at the departure point.
 It'd seemed impossible, but as Mrs. Alexander had gently herded me onto the bus, there'd still been no sign of her.
 "Maybe she's driving instead of taking the bus down.

In fact,” he said with a careful glance around him.
 “I would have jumped at the chance myself.” “I am probably too ugly by both AElf and Nymph standards for her to be interested.
 Then again, you know Nymphs; they are naturally polyamorous and very sexual.
 It is a shock that she was not already sexually involved with one or both of us already.” Doi’van added, “Maybe her AElf blood means she does not have as strong a sex drive as most Nymphs since AElven marriage bonds are always monogamous.
 By the Celestial gods she is half AElf and half Nymph, who knows what to expect.
 Humans and Orqui are both in the middle of their two extremes and becoming emotionally involved with either always ends with heartbreak.” Doi’van’s deep voice was just stating a fact, if an unpleasant one.
 Rodregas nodded, he agreed but he was not the young man he looked.
 “I do understand that, and I expect nothing from her.”  He smiled and said, “But I do plan to enjoy what we do have for as long as it lasts.” “And when she takes other lovers?” Doi’van asked.
 Rodregas responded with the only answer he had, “I will do my best to handle it and not get jealous,” he said.
 Rodregas knew it would be hard, but he was a hard man and he would have to manage.

Ironically, events have unfolded in the reverse sequence.
 Rapid progress has been made during the intervening years to reduce international tensions, but little has yet been done effectively to address the food issue.
 Now that opportunity is before us and compels us to act, for without significant progress on abolishing hunger from the earth, our efforts at arms control and peace making may come to naught.
 Increasing the availability of food and jobs form essential components of a comprehensive strategy to eradicate hunger, poverty and violence from the world.
 Food Security
 Despite great achievements in the post-war period, we live in a world of persistent hunger amidst plenty.
 Presently, around 800 million people living in 46 countries are malnourished and 40,000 die every day of hunger and hunger-related diseases.
 Widespread famine currently threatens nine African countries, where the lives of 20 million people are at risk.
 Hunger and famine are usually associated with a physical shortage of food.
 Yet, even where food supplies are adequate, absence of opportunities for gainful employment to generate the purchasing power needed to buy food can result in hunger.

Harruq shoved open the door and then halted as he breathed in the stuffy air.
 “Nothing like home, eh?” he said.
 “Move, before the meat spoils,” Qurrah said.
 The big half-orc stepped out of the way.
 Qurrah came through, carrying a slab of meat in his hands.
 He weaved across the missing planks in the floor and sat next to a small circle of stones.
 Above him was a hole in the ceiling for the smoke to escape.
 “Since when has spoiling meat stopped me from eating it?” Harruq asked.
 Qurrah laughed.
 “Which explains so much.”

I’m thinking about reviving it.
 Because it was never really a Black Lung song.
 It was more personal, a statement of a kind.
 See, I was already moving away from the group before the group ever really got started.
 People have to understand.
 I’ve always been a solo artist.
 I was held back by Black Lung.
 All that shit about he left his roots behind, he broke up a great band, etc.
 I mean, fuck that.
 It’s like Lennon, you know—he was always a solo artist.

 With the time Olga didn’t spend laboring for the sake of acquiring stuff or treating herself to luxuries, along with writing and prayer, she attended gatherings of all kinds where she could meet folks who needed her to teach, or console, or pray with them.
 She chose to live much like Jesus, who passed through the world keeping a lookout for people he could help.
 The Secret
 I could use Olga’s comment that a family or business person might need a bigger house to justify my bigger house.
 I have a daughter and a business, the college.

"If I ever really decide the outcome is a foregone conclusion, you'd better start watching out for your people.
 You'd be surprised just how many of them could disappear if I no longer worried about the consequences of my actions."
 The tingle of Alec's power lessened slightly once we were out of sight, but it still hadn't dropped off completely by the time we were standing in front of Mrs. Tiggs' classroom.
 I could still feel the faintest traces of his power long after he'd finally let my hand go with obvious reluctance and strode off, leaving Dominic and I to find our seats.
 ** The pack was more subdued than normal on the way home.
 Everyone splintered off into smaller component parts as soon as we passed the wrought-iron gate signaling the entrance to the Graves estate.
 Donovan was waiting patiently inside the door, but he took one look at the bristling bundle of energy that was Alec, and obviously revised his plans on the spot.
 "Shall I have dinner delayed, Master Alec, Mistress Rachel?"
 "I'll take mine later, Donovan, but please don't let that inconvenience the rest of the household.
 I'll be out in the garden if anyone needs me."

Seth gripped the handlebars and I knew he was losing his temper.
 “I was being cautious so we didn’t have to worry last night,” He said through gritted teeth.
 He was lying and both of us knew that.
 I glared at him, “Nice story Seth, now what really happened?” He didn’t say anything and he rode ahead to get beside Jason, who was in the lead.
 The park slowly came in view.
 It was a huge grass circle with a small play set in the middle covered in kids.
 The woods surrounded it except for the side that faced the street.
 A fountain was near the entrance along with a bike rack.
 That’s where we parked our bikes.
 I clicked the lock together and grabbed my bag.

I was half worried he was going to spend the rest of his life so mired in responsibility, he'd never let himself notice anyone."
 I was flabbergasted, but my lack of response didn't faze her in the slightest.
 "I take it he finally realized you aren't a shape shifter then?"
 Apparently my astonishment leaked through to my expression, that or maybe she could just smell the shock on me.
 Whatever the reason, her smile took on new intensity, and she slowly reached out and clasped my hand again.
 "I'm sorry; I spend so much of my time alone with my thoughts that they develop well-worn grooves.
 I forget sometimes that other people haven't been privy to the endless hours of speculation that got me from one point to another."
 There was something about her touch that distracted me.
 Not in a bad way, almost like the tickle you get in the back of your mind when you know you're missing out on some key point of plot in a suspense novel.
 "You glow much more brightly than any human I've ever met, but you don't feel like a shape shifter, so you're either a very powerful Fir'shan, one strong enough to mask your nature from Alec, as well as me, or you're a very extraordinary human.

 Did some great stuff and then—poof!—they pulled a Pynchon.
 Whereabouts unknown, you know?
 I think I was credited there as Dead Byrd Rung.

Alec stood, and it wasn't until I went up at the same time that I realized he was carrying me.
 "I think she'll be fine, but maybe I should get her to the nurse.
 Just to be sure."
 Even as he was talking, Alec was moving towards the door.
 "There's really no need.
 I'm fine.
 I don't need to see the nurse."
 It was obvious he was going to ignore me.
 I tried to thrash around enough for him to put me down, but he restrained my arms with a couple of fingers.
 The motion was so casual I was pretty sure nobody even realized he'd pinned my arms to my stomach with surprising strength.

So, they’d go off and I’d pick up the guitar.
 That’s just the way I was then.
 All music all the time.

 CM:  	Who played with you around this time?
 BG:  	No one played with us, man.
 I mean, aside from Jim or Sid sitting in.
 CM:  	I meant, who opened for you, at the Shell, etc.
 BG: 	Oh, yeah.
 Well, there were a lot of groups around Memphis then.

“Never ever should have gotten myself screwed up like this.”
 But a part of him liked it, and that scared him even more.

 Harruq arrived at the clearing the next morning at the same time as always.
 Aurelia stepped out from behind a tree, her cold, emotionless face so different from the previous day.
 “We have sparred our two weeks, Harruq,” she said.
 “You have no need to come here.”
 “Yeah, well, you heard what I said yesterday,” Harruq said, his face red.
 “What was that?”

Rachel's face tried to take on her liar's mask, but didn't quite succeed.
 "You risked a lot to stop Cassie from hurting me.
 The least I can do is tell you anything I know that could save you from getting hurt in return."
 She was telling the truth.
 Not all of it, but at least some of it.
 I wanted to tell her she didn't owe me anything, but there were so many questions I needed answered still.
 There was some kind of weird power struggle going on, and her brother was right in the middle of it all, but I couldn't ask her about any of it.
 She'd already said as much as she was going to.
 I nodded my thanks, and went to stand again, but she captured my arm before I could complete the motion.
 "There are a lot of things I can't tell you, but anything you want to know about me is fair game.

I assume it is not the Northern Kingdoms as you said to Audrian.
 For one thing that would be stupid, and for a second you seem to be climbing ever higher into the Arida Mountains and that is hardly the best way north.” Rodregas nodded.
 He hoped to make it to his hideaway by nightfall, so he decided it did not hurt to share his plan at this point.
 “You’re right; we are not going to the Northern Kingdoms.
 A few companions and I were hiding out in the Aridas and in one of the higher hollows I found an old farmhouse.
 It has been abandoned for a long time, but it is well made and there is water and lots of fruit trees and berry bushes that must be left over from an old orchard.” After a moment he added, “I always thought that if I ever needed a place to hide out that it was ideal.
 Of course it will be rough there.
 Outside of what we bring, there will not be much.
 But it will be a good place to rest and…” he said gently patting his stomach, “heal up.
 We should be there by nightfall.” “Not bad,” said Imeralda.

Which meant I spent the day getting shocked.
 I was grateful when we finally stopped to make camp.
 I was afraid they would resume training after dinner, so I found a place off by myself and pretended to rest as I went back to reading the diary.
 Today was exhilarating.
 For the first time in I don’t know how long, I was out of the castle.
 Free from practice, free from duties, free from walls.
 Though tricky to set up, the spell worked on Rune.
 I showed up at practice early and whispered the words in case something went wrong and he heard.
 I can’t imagine what my punishment would have been, though it might have been worth it.
 He fell asleep quickly and I ran as fast as I could, my pulse pounding with excitement.

 Eugene – I don’t see why he would hold me back, it’s not as if…
