“You are a scoutmaster for the Quellan elves, are you not?” he asked.
 “I am.
 And you have remained outside our village for several days yet vanish with the morning sun.”
 “Have I done something wrong?” Velixar asked.
 Dieredon frowned, noticing the subtle yet constant changes to the man’s facial features.
 His instincts cried out in warning.
 This man was dangerous.
 “Children have been dying in our forest, all found horribly butchered,” Dieredon said.
 “As you can plainly see, I am nowhere near the forest,” Velixar said.
 His voice was calm, disarming.

Jim – Yeah, I don’t really like Mayan art.
 Liz – That’s all?
 Jim – It’s also difficult to sleep on those hard desks.
 Liz – You’re never going to graduate.
 Jim – Sure I am, this spring.
 Liz – You finally talked to your councilor?
 Jim – Yep.
 Liz – What did he say?
 Jim – Well, the first thing out of his mouth was “who the hell are you?”
 Liz – I told you that you should have talked to him sooner.

"In two weeks.
 Marie and I are going to spend three weeks there, and Jefferson and John will drive out on the weekends.
 You could come with them."
 Marie had been looking forward to going to the Cape, but listening to her mother talk about it, she wasn't so sure she was up to going.
 She needed the familiarity of home.
 She went up to her room soon after Tom left.
 She hadn't bought a stuffed animal for Rick's t-shirt, so she spread the shirt over a pillow.
 After she'd changed into a nightgown, she clutched his handkerchief in her fist and sat down in the rocking chair by her bed.
 She wished she'd gone to the library today--she'd like to have something to occupy her mind.
 She-- There was a tap at her door.

Chapter 9: Times They Are a Changing Back in Sacramento, freebasing and disco were big.
 Before long, one of my roommates was busted with an abundance of cocaine and I narrowly missed the arrest.
 I was literally driving away from the house and saw cop cars coming down the street toward it.
 I watched in the rearview mirror as they surrounded the house and I knew he was inside high on free-base and well supplied with cocaine.
 Shortly thereafter I decided to move away and find a new environment.
 Sacramento seemed like it was now completely out of control!
 People were staying up for days on end freebasing, and it was not fun being around someone who is focused on his next fix or dolling out drugs to fellow addicts.
 I moved to Lake Tahoe because they still didn’t give a shit how anyone dressed and that was fine with me.
 No white polyester pants here!
 My best friend Pete and I opened a waterbed and hot tub store in North Lake Tahoe called Sierra Waterbeds and Hot Tubs— a venture his father funded.

"Do you-do you want me to-to rub some on you?"
 He glanced up, on the verge of asking her why, since it was only his arms, not his back, that needed the lotion.
 Instead, he silently handed her the bottle.
 Marie squeezed some lotion into her hand.
 Starting at his wrist, she rubbed his arm, working her way up.
 When she reached the tan line where his sleeve began, her hands glided up to the red spot just below his neck.
 "You-you must not have put sunscreen here.
 It's really red."
 He gazed at her averted face as she rubbed lotion on his chest.
 He was sure she could feel the pounding of his heart when her hands strayed from the sunburnt spot.

Judith Moore, a wise and benevolent editor at the San Diego Reader, sent me to Tijuana to report on the Missionaries of Charity seminary there.
 I spent a few glorious days talking to the brothers.
 I found them the kindest, most generous, least self-concerned group I have ever encountered.
 But they were also the happiest of people, which I couldn’t make sense of, until one afternoon when a mob of locals came to pick up groceries.
 These folks lived in a shantytown on the bank of an oily swamp I call the Black Lagoon.
 The neighborhood is so poor that when my cousin and I delivered a rusted tool shed to one of the families, they used it as a granny flat.
 I was helping the Brothers pass out vegetables when I got blessed with a feeling so profound, the recollection of it still uplifts me.
 These people I was helping, though not on my own but as a paid reporter, were blessing me.
 Like Curly did at Chapters Books.
 And like Mother Teresa blessed me.

Art – Who let you out this time.
 Eugene – Johnny did when he got back a couple minutes ago.
 He’s my current hero.
 Liz – I wonder how long that will last.
 Karen – From what I’ve seen, only until Art starts carving the turkey.
 Then whoever hands him his plate will take that place.
 Jim – I don’t think it will even last that long.
 Karen – Dinner is only a few minutes away.
 Jim – I know.

“Fine,” he said.
 “I promise.
 Happy?”
 “Far from it.”
 Aurelia crossed her legs, tossed back her hair, and then leaned her head on her hands as she stared into the fire.
 “I want you to listen to me, alright Harruq?”
 “Sure.”
 He glanced down, uncomfortable and saddened that Aurelia refused to look him in the eye.
 “Velixar is not who you think he is.
 He isn’t _what_ you think he is.

Jim – Eugene will be going back to school too, so hopefully Johnny will be easier to live with.
 Art – Maybe he will, and maybe the sun will fall from the sky and strike me dead.
 Jim – You can always hope.
 Art – I’m not that gullible.
 Jim – You play the lottery still don’t you?
 You’ve more chance of both having the sun fall on you, and Johnny becoming the ideal prodigy child than you have of winning the lottery.
 Art – Yes, but playing the lottery is my choice, I may not have a snow-ball’s chance in hell of winning, but I don’t have to play either.
 Now I don’t have very little control over Johnny, I wish I did, but I don’t.
 The only thing Johnny’s shaping up holds in common with winning the lottery is that the chances are slim and all I’ll ever be able to do is fantasize about it.
 Jim – If only you did win the lotto, then you could buy a nice tropical island somewhere and send Johnny to it.

"That's the surprise?"
 He laughed.
 "No.
 I have to work late because of the surprise.
 I have quite a bit of vacation time coming, and I thought I'd take some next week.
 Since I'm not giving much notice, I have a lot of things I have to take care of tomorrow."
 If a vacation was the surprise, it must include her, but she didn't want to make any assumptions.
 "What plans have you made for your vacation?"
 "I thought we'd spend Saturday shopping for whatever you may need, and we'll leave Sunday morning."
 "Leave for where?"

Junnie.
 She stared back at me for one brief moment before she turned to fight some invisible foe.
 The stunned moment took the last of the borrowed courage from me, and I drew in, afraid, as my body remained encaged in vine and thorns.
 My legs were wet with blood, arms deadened to the pain and cold.
 I became aware of an unbroken chant, a voice I didn’t recognize, and I turned, stunned again, as I saw Asher.
 He wasn’t in the battle.
 He stood back, seemingly a bystander as the words flowed from his barely moving lips.
 Then he ran.
 Confusion again as Junnie followed after him.
 Chased him.

She didn’t answer.
 The study was empty.
 I let out a shaky breath and glanced around.
 Nothing was out of place except for a thistle on the table.
 It was thriving, but unplanted.
 I examined it closer.
 It was rather large, and though the blooms looked healthy, the exposed roots were black, seemingly rotted.
 I didn’t understand how a plant could survive without soil and with those decayed roots.
 I scanned the table, but it was the only plant aside from Junnie’s potted ivies and flowers, hanging as they always had.
 At my touch, the thistle leaves crumbled.

My be-all and end-all.
 I realize outsiders can’t understand—they see, what, witchcraft or some kind of nefarious necromancy at work.
 Shit, man, it’s love.
 You know, LOVE?
 I wrote that song because Lorelei changed my life.
 It’s like “Julia”, you know, the Lennon song?
 Julia as all-women.
 That’s Lor.
 She’s the feminine principle, the earth-mother, female rain, Moon Goddess.
 It’s in the song.

I fished out my notes and desperately tried to remember how to calculate some of the stuff we'd need to know in order to successfully get our weight up the ramp, over the obstacles, and otherwise to the appropriate destination using the minimum number of pulleys, the shortest ramp, and the thinnest string possible.
 Alec hardly even looked up as Mrs. Alexander came by with our particular spool of thread, an array of metric weights, and a note card bearing the amount of weight we'd been assigned to move around.
 I was still leafing through my binder when Alec started testing the strength of our 'tow line.'
 I scooted my desk over and picked up a weight to hand to him, only to see the thread break as he successfully figured out the breaking point.
 Again and again it happened.
 I ran a calculation for how many pulleys we'd need to lift our weight up the thirty-degree incline on a string able to hold only a fourth as much, only to look over at his paper and see not only had he already arrived at the correct figure, he'd already thought to adjust for starting friction.
 Not used to being outclassed academically, I got flustered, which led to a misplaced decimal, and then an incorrect conversion from English to metric.
 Alec just continued on, never seeming to really hurry, never actually making a mistake, but still grinding through calculations with a speed I might have been able to match on a good day, but couldn't even approach today.
 It would've been much easier to just stop my efforts and watch him work, but I was too stubborn to give up.
 Alec finished up with the theoretical portion of the assignment, and started stringing the pulleys while most of the other groups were still arguing over whether or not they could afford to add a few extra grams for extra credit.

I could pay you twice the pittance you work for.”
 “Just shut up,” Harruq said, hurling Salvation across the room.
 Ahrqur leapt again.
 The sword punched through the couch and embedded in the wall.
 The half- orc gripped Condemnation in both hands, snarling as the elf launched his own offensive series.
 The elven blade glided through the air, repeatedly feinting and looping wide so that Harruq’s sword danced about for phantom blows.
 Ahrqur let out a mocking laugh, gave him an obvious feint, and then kicked high.
 The foot smashed the bottom of Harruq’s chin, the same sore part Dieredon had hit.
 Harruq staggered back, his sword swinging wildly.
 The elf charged in, knowing he outmatched the half-orc in speed and skill.

I was so happy I forgot how arrogant he was, and I smiled at him as he sat down.
 It was like he was looking at something that wasn't even human.
 My insides seemed to freeze and shrink.
 I couldn't even muster up my normal blush of embarrassment.
 I'd had plenty of people hate me since I'd arrived in Sanctuary, but he was the first person I'd met who I was convinced wouldn't have thrown me a life preserver if I was drowning.
 It wasn't even because saving me would be too much work.
 He was completely convinced the world would be a better place without me.
 I'd never been so unnerved in my life.
 As Mrs. Alexander took roll and then released us into our groups, I was still trying to pull myself back together.
 It didn't help when I realized we were being evaluated today.

What choice did I have?
 And then I laughed, because I couldn’t even trust myself.
 I expected him to look at me like I was mad.
 Instead, he looked like it was… endearing.
 He stood and walked over to me, taking my hand to help me up.
 When he touched me, I tried to fight the heat that ran up my neck.
 I couldn’t and embarrassment caused my cheeks to color as well.
 I peered up at him through my now-dark bangs and could have sworn it amused him.
 I laughed at myself.
 The silly romance I’d been reading in the diary must have been affecting me.

I stood and Dino directed me to approach him.
 He was obviously drunk and I could see the usual crazed look in his eyes.
 He started rambling something about how I didn’t like him or respect him and I quickly claimed I did.
 I was a lanky fifteen year old, probably about 5’8’, 140 pounds.
 He stepped towards me as I obeyed his wish for me to come to him.
 He hit me so fast I didn’t see it coming, and I flew backwards onto the desktop.
 All four legs of the desk broke beneath the impact of my body.
 I lay there stunned on my back.
 As Dino walked towards me I could see the crowd of guests rushing in behind him.
 He straddled me and I gathered my legs towards my chest with my arms crossed in front of my face to protect myself.

“Harruq, I need you.
 Where are you?”
 Then he heard talking and shut his mouth.
 “Are you alright, Dieredon?” an elf asked.
 The scoutmaster nodded, leaning heavily on his bow.
 “I will be fine.
 His magic left my body upon his death.”
 A neigh brought his attention upward.
 Sonowin landed next to him, her white hair stained red in places.
 She nuzzled the elf and snorted something.

“You murdered the children and gave them to your brother.
 You’re the Forest Butcher.
 Admit it so I may kill you.”
 “I will admit no such thing,” Harruq said, his jaw trembling.
 “You’re guessing.”
 “I have also seen your brother meeting the strange man in black of the ever- changing face.
 What is his name, Harruq?
 What is it he offers you?”
 “You’re out of your mind.”
 The tip buried in deeper.

I was afraid I wouldn’t be able to extinguish it before it hit me.
 My feet were frozen in place.
 I could only think of one thing: Fight fire with fire.
 I flung my arm toward the incoming stream of flames and a tongue of fire akin to a dragon’s shot out and collided with it.
 I was shocked.
 I’d only used my power to light candles and lanterns.
 I’d had no idea I could produce such a vicious plume of flames.
 I looked to Chevelle.
 “Yes,” he exalted.
 He raised his arms above his head to construct a massive circle of blazing heat.

For some reason, it infuriated me, and I nearly berated him right there.
 But I remembered I was on the run.
 I remembered this strange elf in front of me.
 I decided to keep my mouth shut before I dug a deeper hole.
 An arm wrapped around my shoulder and drew me forward.
 “Introduce us, buttercup.” I grimaced.
 My companion was certainly enjoying himself.
 Chevelle held his hand out in a formal greeting.
 “Chevelle Vattier.” “Vattier, eh?” I thought I heard the stranger mutter under his breath, “Well, you can call me Bonnie Bell.” Chevelle waited unmoved for his response.
 He finally held his hand out in return.

"What happened last night...it was for real, wasn't it?"
 Rachel didn't ask what I meant; she didn't even bat an eye.
 "I'm afraid so.
 Don't hate the others too much.
 Sometimes when you're that scared it's hard to keep things in perspective.
 Now that they've calmed down a little nobody would really trade you to Brandon on the tiny chance it might smooth things over.
 Not when we'll eventually end up in exactly the same spot."
 "It felt kind of like a game of capture the flag, with me as the flag."
 It wasn't the most flattering comparison ever invented, but at least it allowed me to try and convince myself I'd imagined the near-violence.
 Rachel's laugh was short and bitter.

 She smiled to herself, thinking about how sweet he was to her.
 Already she was feeling better about ending her betrothal to Davis.

 A man like Rick.
 Tears filled her eyes yet again, and she snatched up a tissue to dab at them to keep from ruining her make-up.
 Rick loved her.

My sister is out every day but I can never seem to find her.
 She keeps bringing back the strangest treasures.
 I have run for two days now.
 I think tomorrow I will follow her.
 She refuses to tell me where she goes, neither under threat nor for a bribe, so I’ll have to use stealth.
 ~ Today was brilliant.
 I left a sleeping Rune just in time to find my sister sneaking from the castle.
 I followed her all the way to her secret spot.
 It took us half the day to get there, but it was worth it.
 It’s so far away from any kind of traffic, I have no idea how she even discovered it.

How could she have been thinking about 2011 when she knew nothing about it?
 She picked up a book with a chapter on traveling through time by thought.
 Like most of the others, it was about traveling backwards, so it couldn’t explain how she got here, but now she was trying to travel backwards.
 It said you should surround yourself with objects from the period you wanted to go to and eliminate any evidence of the present and then think about a scene from the period.
 That was pretty much what she’d been doing .
 .
 .
 but she’d worn her new underwear most days.
 And she’d had a hard time keeping her mind on 1927.
 She needed to wear her old underwear and lose herself in thoughts of home.

I didn't necessarily mind the fact that I spent hours more on homework than any of my peers, but being praised for it always felt like a backhanded insult.
 "It's okay, I'm not going to slack off.
 I want to be done with extra assignments as badly as you want to be finished with having to grade them."
 My feeble joke evoked a smile, but I wasn't quite free to go.
 "Well, your homework is easier to grade than most.
 I also wanted to let you know that I'm happy with what you've been doing at the lab, and to give you this."
 As unbelievable as it was considering that most of my classmates seemed more concerned with working their fast-food jobs than with doing homework, the plain envelope she handed me contained my very first paycheck.
 Ever.
 I all but skipped out of the classroom.
 Later I'd probably complain about how small it was and wish I had enough to go shoe shopping, but for now it was just nice to know I had some discretionary money.

“Who is he?”
 The half-orc chuckled.
 “She, not he.
 She saved my life, and she’s also been teaching me to read.”
 “How did she save your life?” Qurrah asked.
 “Remember a few months back when I came home beaten, bloody, and blue?” he asked.
 “Guards caught me trying to sneak inside Maggie’s Tavern.
 They attacked me, said they were going to arrest me as the Forest Butcher.
 Aurelia stopped them.”
 Qurrah rubbed his chin, lost in thought.

"I'm sorry having dinner with me is such a burden on you," she snapped, turning to leave.
 Davis grabbed her arm, pulling her around to face him.
 "Don't talk to me like that!"
 "You shouted at me!"
 "You deserved it."
 She glared at him, trying to wrench her arm free.
 "You're hurting me."
 "Maybe that will remind you not to talk back to me."
 He released her with a slight shove and turned to stalk off.
 Marie's anger dissolved into pain, and she hurried to her room to hide her tears.

Antonil closed the scroll and then nodded for his soldiers to return to their post.
 Holding in a curse, he headed to the royal stables.
 He needed to speak with Dieredon and personally break the terrible news.

 Qurrah smirked as the guard captain hurried away.
 “Elves banned,” he said to his brother.
 “Amusing, though unnecessary.
 Only handfuls live within these walls, and they are just diplomats and messengers.

She'd known how it would impact me, but hadn't cared.
 I finally gave up on trying to immerse myself in nineteenth-century France, and cried myself to sleep.
 ** It was all I could do to drag myself out of bed Monday morning.
 A part of me knew this was all stupid, but I couldn't shake the depression.
 I was just aware enough to register Brandon's concerned glances as he drove me into school.
 Mrs. Sorenson shot me a nasty look as I stumbled into class.
 "Well isn't it nice of you to come to class today.
 And here we all thought you were doing so well you didn't need to bother with the test."
 I took the proffered test and made my unsteady way back to my desk.
 The class passed in a blur as I made a half-hearted attempt to focus on the questions and remember all kinds of facts about photosynthesis that I'd known just a few days before.

She rose just as Davis appeared in the living room.
 "Darling!"
 He crossed the room to draw her into his arms, kissing her cheek.
 "What happened to you?"
 "We're not discussing that right now, Davis," Mrs. Tranton said.
 "We're just enjoying having her back."
 "Of course."
 Davis took her hand, and they sat on the sofa.
 "How have you been, darling?"
 Marie gaped at him.

I mean, fuck, she didn’t even open her mouth.
 Don’t you hate that shit?
 So, I’m standing there, I might as well have had my dick out, and she looked at me like I was a piece of modern art that she couldn’t figure out.
 And, finally, after I had already turned back into an awkward 12 year old, she said, sorry, I can’t be doing that.
 That was it.
 That was her explanation.
 I never saw that chick again, I can tell you.
 I mean, I got out of there fast and tried to restabilize my pride, and I just thought, well, fuck it, I don’t know what that was all about, I don’t pretend to understand what that was all about.
 So, anyway, that inspired this song—actually, Lor and I talking about that incident inspired that song.
 The line “she was going through her midtown period/there was blood in the air” is mostly Lor’s.

Only a tiny part hit his shoulder, immediately encasing it in ice.
 Then Harruq was upon him, slashing recklessly.
 Ahrqur batted his sword left and right, then jumped as Harruq swung back in a scissor-cut that should have shredded his waist.
 The elf landed atop one of his couches, balancing with ease.
 “What reason do you have to kill me?” the elf asked.
 “Are you here for money?
 I could pay you twice the pittance you work for.”
 “Just shut up,” Harruq said, hurling Salvation across the room.
 Ahrqur leapt again.
 The sword punched through the couch and embedded in the wall.

Employment is a sine qua non for meeting these challenges.
 A thorough examination of facts and a dispassionate analysis reveal grounds for hope and opportunities for action.
 The possibility of more rapid economic growth and rising incomes in both developed and developing countries – spurred by further substantial reduction in defence spending, the diffusion and application of new technologies, economic liberalization leading to growth of international trade, the globalization of financial markets, and the emergence of new engines for global expansion among developing countries – indicates that our apprehensions need not prove justified, provided society acts courageously and decisively to meet the challenge.
 A global overview of employment cannot do full justice to the special circumstances, problems and potentials of specific regions and countries, but it can dispel the growing concern that employment has become a problem beyond the means of governments or the global economy to eradicate or even contain.
 In the final analysis, creation of jobs for all is not a question of possibility.
 It is a question of necessity.
 Neither logic nor self-interest justify a detached attitude or a half-hearted effort to address this issue.
 As in the case of the recent global response to the threat of global warming from depletion of the ozone layer, it simply is not acceptable for us to remain indifferent or claim that we are powerless to act where the entire world’s vital self-interests are at stake.
 When war threatens a nation’s borders, technology threatens its environment or unemployment threatens the livelihood of its people and the fabric of its social existence, there is only one acceptable response – that is, action.
 The greatest achievement of this century has not been technological, economic or political, but rather the growing concern and intolerance for the slaughter, persecution or impoverishment of other human beings.

 "Mmm.

 But her attention was completely on her chowder.
 Relaxing again, he asked casually, "What do you do for fun in 1927?"

Imeralda smiled back at the complement and the three got back and continued their walk to the Chamber of Sigils.
 CHAPTER 16 TO RAISE A SWORD
 Rodregas was careful to walk with the confidence due of a new knight eager for his awards.
 Doi’van and Imeralda followed two steps behind, both playing the role of faithful servants to the hilt.
 He saw the double, engraved doors ahead of them, a pair of knights on each side of the door.
 The doors were large enough that the three of them could have entered abreast through the threshold and the doors were solid enough, looking as if they were made out of whole trees.
 Bound in iron, they looked like they could handle a battering ram better than even the front gates.
 A group of knights stood tall next to the doors, but their heads tracked the presence of Rodregas and his two companions.
 Rodregas vaguely remembered one as Gorin, an older man who under more prosperous times for the knighthood would now be enjoying his retirement.
 “Gorin!” Rodregas yelled boastfully, “Open the doors, the Grand Marshal says that I may review the choice I must make.” Rodregas walked over and slapped the knight in the arm, laying it on heavy.

“For the head,” the closest elf shouted in his native tongue.
 He managed one last shot before Harruq closed the distance.
 The half-orc batted the arrow away without thinking.
 “You bastard!” he shouted, slamming into the elf without pausing.
 He buried his swords deep into the elf’s chest as he plowed forward.
 “You hurt my brother!
 You spineless cowards!” The other two abandoned their bows and drew their blades.
 “Your brother is dead,” one elf said.
 “Gaelwren waited for your departure.
 He will not find it difficult killing a wounded dog.”

I could make an electric guitar sing, talk, chant, name your baby.
 It was just natural.
 So, yeah, I got a reputation—they started mentioning my name alongside Beck and Page and you know the list.
 I was airborne, man.
 CM: 	Just for the record here, no pun intended, lemme run down the listings on Turntable Poison.
 Side One: “Blues for Wendy Ward,”  “Mr.
 Handy and Hakel-Bärend.”  Side Two: “In Real Time Nothing Happens,”  “A Marriage of Rue,” “Hayley Mills’ Underpants,”  “For Kim Because it Went by so Fast,”
 BG:  	Had one more song we cut—remember we did this whole thing in, what, 3 days, non-stop, popping uppers, getting patty melts at 3 a.m. from Steak and Egg, so it was kind of a blur.
 And Jim could work like that—he was amazing, a guru, a conductor, a lightning rod.
 But, in that session, we cut “Gogy Goodfriend,” which never ended up on any of our records.

What a time that was.
 Anyway, Carol was suddenly there.
 When I stepped off the stage between gigs there was Debbie with this blond young woman I’d never even noticed in the halls of Central High, so tuned out I was, so really out of the swim as far as high school was concerned.
 I mean, if I’d been paying attention I would never have missed Carol Warner.
 We even had a class together.
 (laughs)  Here’s this blond chick, in a loose shirt that I couldn’t help but look down at two lovely mounds of white white flesh, and a little jean skirt that showed off legs as thick as bedposts, strong, muscular legs—she was on the track team, imagine that—and sweet Debbie, my first love, didn’t know what she was doing, introducing us.
 I mean she put the match to the fireworks and I think regretted it immediately.
 Apparently, Carol asked to meet me.
 Like a fan thing.
 But, man, it was love, lust, whatever, at first sight.

I like her."
 It was nearly midnight when they left.
 "Thank you for the little fountain," Marie told Rick as he unlocked her car door.
 "I haven't bought it for you yet."
 "But you want to.
 You decided to as soon as I admired it.
 Thank you."
 She linked her arms around his neck, smiling into his eyes and then raising her face to kiss him.
 His hands wandered over her back as he returned her kiss.
 "Wow," he murmured, resting his forehead against hers.

Aurelia held him as he lay sobbing in pain.
 She did her best to comfort him, stroking his hair until all his dark strength drained away.
 Exhaustion came soon after, and for an agonizing time Harruq lay there, mumbling incoherently and waiting for the pain to fade.
 At last, he looked up to Aurelia, his eyes a calm brown, the whites bloodshot.
 “I love you,” he said.
 Sleep took him, and relieved, Aurelia let her own eyes close and her hair drape across his face.

He reached out and placed a hand under my chin, bringing my face up to meet his.
 The flush that followed was not from embarrassment.
 Heat flooded my neck, and I felt it might engulf me as he spoke my name.
 “Frey.” “Yes.” It was all I could manage.
 His eyes held mine and I could swear he was searching for something.
 He opened his mouth to speak, but the door of the wardrobe flew open.
 “Oh.” Ruby giggled the tiniest bit.
 “Excuse me.
 I didn’t mean to interrupt.” She seemed pleased she had.
 Chevelle’s hand dropped and I could see out of the corner of my eye his face was hard.

My shoes had never been intended to allow ankles to withstand that kind of punishment.
 Even just walking had been risky, so it wasn't a surprise when my right foot slipped, and a sharp knife of pain shot through that ankle as it collapsed under me.
 Dealing with blinding agony hadn't ever been my strong point.
 I opened my mouth to scream, only to find that no sound would come out.
 The world was still spinning, but I was oriented just enough to realize that Dominic had her hand over my mouth and nose.
 I pulled at her arm, but the effort was completely futile.
 Rising panic over not being able to breathe made me hammer at the iron bar pressing me against her, but she never looked away from whatever had captured her concentration.
 Rachel suddenly appeared off to my right, and she put her finger to her lips, and then sank all ten fingernails into Dominic's arm.
 The sudden absence of the support I'd been unconsciously using to keep weight off of my right foot resulted in tear-jerking pain as the damaged appendage touched down, but I gritted my teeth and managed to keep it down to a hiss.
 Rachel draped my arm over her shoulders, and then dragged me forward a couple of awkward, hopping steps.

The international community should commit itself to a minimum goal of reducing global military expenditure to $400 billion (in 1992 constant dollars) by 2000 AD.
 Military expenditure mitigates but does not resolve the underlying problem of security.
 Today, the most pressing security threats are social, not military.
 The appropriate response to them is greater investment in sustainable human development, not more arms.
 However, preservation of physical security against external aggression is a primal instinct of nation states that cannot be rationalized away.
 Nations will continue to arm themselves as long as that is the only effective means to ensure their security.
 What is needed is a quantum shift from the competitive security paradigm to a cooperative security system in which countries mutually and collectively agree to refrain from acts of aggression and to protect each other from such acts by any nation.
 This principle served to protect the NATO and Warsaw Pact countries in the past, but on an exclusive basis which promoted a polarization of alliances into military blocs and, most importantly, left more than one hundred countries outside the security orbit and vulnerable to proxy wars.
 It should now be restructured on a global basis as a collective security system that offers protection to all nations from external aggression.
 A whole range of new security challenges is rising to confront the global society.

The guards who had brought me here were standing behind me, within arm’s reach on either side.
 Left of them were council members and, as I glanced right, Chevelle walked in to stand at attention, facing the council table.
 I could hear others enter behind us, presumably witnesses, and I wondered if Junnie was among them.
 “Elfreda Georgiana Suzetta Glaforia stands before High Council…” The formal tone of the speaker severed my rambling thoughts, dragging me back to a frightening reality.
 What would they do to me?
 How bad could the punishment be for sneaking into a library?
 And stealing a book.
 Maybe it wasn’t even about that, maybe Fannie had told them I broke into the vault.
 But they were my family’s things too, it couldn’t be that bad.

A comprehensive approach will enable us to anticipate the imbalances and side-effects generated by partial initiatives and to evolve total strategies to avoid them.
 The comprehensive conceptual model needs to be complemented by the development of models for employment, food, education, trade and other fields that go beyond the national or sectoral approach to show the impact of the complex interactions that are key determinants of the development process – for instance, the impact of democracy on agriculture and of increasing agricultural productivity on employment, industrialization and trade, the impact of rising education on democratization, social tolerance for diversity, personal expectations and social stability.
 Once formulated, these conceptual models need to be applied under a variety of conditions to test their validity and demonstrate the value of a comprehensive approach to development.
 Therefore, we have proposed that the UN adopt a number of districts in different regions of the world, including crime-ridden inner cities or impoverished rural areas in industrial countries, to evolve and apply strategies for their rapid transition to a higher level of development.
 Six Goals in Education
 Once formulated, this knowledge needs to be imparted through education.
 Education is the greatest known civilizing force and the single most powerful lever for human development.
 Training imparts skills, but education increases the capacity of the individual at a more basic level, making the mind more active and alert, converting physical energy into mental energy, training us to see things from a wider perspective, to question and challenge the status quo, to think and imagine, to innovate and invent, to make decisions for ourselves and to act on our own initiative.
 Education is the process by which society passes on the accumulated knowledge and experience of countless centuries to new generations in a systematic, concentrated and abridged form, so that today’s young people can start their lives at the high point of knowledge and wisdom attained by preceding generations.
 Education replaces the slow, subconscious process of trial and error learning with a swift, conscious process.

Chevelle stopped on a ridge to allow us a better view.
 I didn’t think I would have called it a village—I couldn’t count the structures from our vantage point but it must have been ten times the size of home.
 The buildings were the dull stone of the mountain.
 None were trees.
 There was really no vegetation at all, no greens, no browns.
 The entire layout was dark, ashen stones and aged wood that seemed to melt right in to the blue-gray of the mountain.
 The cloudy mist filtered the sun.
 I decided it was beautiful.
 “Where are we?” I asked.
 Chevelle nodded toward my hands as he started down the path.

Harruq’s gut screamed against the idea, but in the end, he listened to his brother.
 He drew his swords and gave chase.
 Qurrah waited until Harruq was around the corner before taking out one of his small glass vials.
 Before he could pull the cork off the top, he heard a voice speak.
 “So many dead by your hands yet a single arrow nearly takes your life?”
 The half-orc froze, the vial clutched in his hands.
 An elf emerged from behind the building, his body decorated in a brilliant green cloak and silvery armor.
 It was the same elf who had fired the first warning shot to Antonil before the entire battle had begun.
 “I am but a poor outcast,” Qurrah said, hiding the handle of the whip underneath the palm of his hand.
 The coiled leather vibrated, hungering for blood.

 Gimme a Lou Reed kind of thing.
 Half talk the damn story.
 I’m gonna use that melody behind you.
 And he did, man, he played what I was singing on a plastic tonette—no shit, that’s that weird, unearthly descant in the background, Jim on this little toy.
 It’s not in the credits, so you’re getting it first, right?
 And I just did my best Lou Reed impersonation, intoning, Her glances could break arms.

He stood up when he saw her, and she walked into his arms.
 "What do I need to do to get ready for Hollywood?"
 she asked, rubbing her cheek against his shoulder.
 She spent the day washing and ironing and folding clothes and cleaning the house.
 While the lasagna she'd made for dinner baked, she made a list of what she wanted to buy the next day.
 They needed new beach towels and more sunscreen and aloe vera lotion.
 She wanted a nice dress to wear in the evening, but she hesitated about putting it on the list.
 She didn't want to ask Rick for anything frivolous, and she'd probably get to wear the dress only once or twice.
 But she didn't want him to be embarrassed by a companion who wasn't dressed appropriately.
 Well, she'd ask him where he planned to take her and what she should wear.

 “Grab my wrist,” Qurrah said as the dark cloud arrived that night.
 Harruq did so, and together they stepped inside.
 He felt an unseen hand grab his chest, and then they were running blind.
 The minutes crawled, their frantic breathing the only audible sound.
 Qurrah lagged further and further behind, unable to keep the pace.

They kept their weapons sheathed and hidden.
 The closer they got before the men panicked the better.
 “Halt, who goes there?” one of the guards shouted to them as they neared.
 They wore polished chainmail shining red in the firelight.
 The crest of Neldar adorned their tabards.
 Longswords hung from their belts.
 “Me be Harruq Tun!” the half-orc said as he stepped further into the light, grinning stupidly.
 “And this be me brother, Qurrah!”
 “Get back you smelly thing,” the other guard said.
 Both stood to face him as other guards stirred from their blankets and bedrolls.

 She rubbed it all over her exposed skin and then stretched out on her stomach.
 Rick took the bottle.
 "I'll rub some on your back."
 "Oh."
 She hadn't even thought about that.

“When did I say we would?”
 “When we first met,” Qurrah said.
 “You said the cooperation between the races needs to end.
 If we are to destroy our home, I must know when.”
 Then Velixar did something completely unexpected.
 He laughed.
 “It will not be our hands that destroy Woodhaven,” Velixar said.
 “King Vaelor will do so for us by starting a war that will give us the dead we need.”
 “How?” Qurrah asked.
 The fire burned in Velixar’s eyes, deep with anticipation.

He was fierce and wore a long scar across his brow that touched his cheek.
 He kept his hair cropped short, not wanting to hide any part of the damage.
 And my mother, though my dreams gave her two names.
 Dark hair, blowing in the wind, arms outstretched, the pendant hanging at her neck glowing fiercely.
 Fire, flames, burning.
 And then water.
 Drowning.
 Over and over and over.
 It almost made the cliff dreams more bearable, to be away from the repetitive drowning.
 I swam around in these impressions for what seemed like an eternity.

Just before I left elementary school someone had read us a newspaper article about some poor guy being pushed over a railing and falling to his death.
 I'd had nightmares for months.
 Dreams where the stairs had turned slick and I'd slid all the way down them.
 Dreams where the banister hadn't even been there and the stairs had become impossibly narrow, and nightmares where I'd somehow stumbled and started to fall over the edge of the railing.
 This was like all of those dreams put together, only happening to someone else.
 A couple of kids reached out, but the only people who could've really stopped him had already been bowled over.
 Time slowed down for me as he hit the railing and started over it.
 His feet came up and his torso was hanging in the void when someone reached over and grabbed his arm.
 I heard a grunt of effort, saw him stop moving, and only then realized it was Ben who'd nearly died.
 In the split second between Ben being gently placed back on the stairs, and everyone starting to breathe again, I followed the arm that'd saved him back to see who the hero was.

There are no serious conflicts in the world today that cannot be resolved through consultation, consensus and ‘win-win’ formulas.
 Full Employment
 The fading spectre of nuclear annihilation gave way in the 1990s to the rising spectre of chronic unemployment.
 The end of the Cold War brought with it some wrenching transitions, among them the break-up of the USSR and Comecom, the reunification of Germany, the downsizing of defence manufacturers in America as the result of reduced orders for war materiel, the collapse of Japanese financial markets and onset of a decade-long recession, and displacement of millions of migrant Asian workers following the invasion of Kuwait and the first war in Iraq.
 These events violently disrupted expansion of the world economy and creation of employment opportunities for an expanding labour force in both industrialized and developing countries.
 Near panic levels of concern rippled across the world during this period about rising levels of joblessness, prompting one doomsday author to prophesize the ‘end of work’.
 The situation became particularly acute in developing countries, because of their predominately young populations and high population growth rates.
 Trends and Prospects
 ICPF refused to side with the pessimists who viewed unemployment as a terminal illness spreading rapidly through the entire world economic system.
 Its report presented evidence to dispel the twin myths that technological development and trade were net job destroyers.

Each of the strains I had grown the day Evelyn choked was flourishing.
 Noxious weeds were taking over the meadow.
 As I stood there, frozen before this changed garden, I was overwhelmed by the scene, overtaken by emotion, and had to press my eyes closed.
 Light rain began to fall and I raised my head to the sky, drawing in a deep breath.
 The cool water trickled down my face, calming the heat of my pulse.
 But it didn’t clear my head.
 I still couldn’t understand.
 A painful fear shot through me, and I tilted my head forward to run through the growth.
 Vines, thorns and leaves turned to muddy ash as they touched my outstretched arms, wet with rain.
 When I reached the edge of the onetime garden, I stopped to kneel, digging my fingers deep into the soil to form a trench.

Of course, there can be and are temporary dislocations and disorientations, sometimes severe, resulting from the rapid speed of social transformation that makes existing attitudes and skills obsolescent within a lifetime or less and compels human beings to learn to adapt faster and further than ever before in human history.
 This is the challenge posed by the evolution of humanity from the physical to mental stage, the flip side of the process that has given birth to all the miraculous achievements of the past few hundred years.
 It is a challenge posed to all humanity to expand our minds and acquire more flexible attitudes, to learn and adapt faster, to convert the stress of change into the joy of higher accomplishment.
 The world that is emerging is one of unprecedented opportunity to tackle the problem of unemployment that emerged with the Industrial Revolution, the massive movement of people from the land into the cities, massive migrations from one country and continent to another in search of economic opportunities, and the lightning speed of technological development that has eradicated traditional occupations while spawning whole new types and fields of human activity.
 Thus, we are faced with the paradox: an employment problem of unprecedented dimension coupled with an opportunity of unprecedented magnitude; a problem that is not going to be eliminated any time soon by the force of market mechanisms alone, but one which can be dramatically diminished by the appropriate action of governments around the world.
 Opportunities, strategies, instruments and mechanisms are not lacking, provided there is a commitment and determination of commensurate strength, a commitment that is best formulated and enshrined by a recognition of employment as a fundamental human right supported by constitutional guarantees, a commitment that must be translated into a determination by all countries to implement a broad spectrum of available strategies to address the issue today.
 Among these strategies, the greatest necessity is for every country to continuously upgrade the quality, quantity and, most importantly, relevance of educational and vocational training programs to equip its citizens with the knowledge and skills needed for productive engagement in a rapidly evolving world.
 Food Security
 The world produces more than sufficient food to amply provide for all of humanity.
 Still, more than 800 million people spread throughout the developing world lack sufficient and secure access to nutritious food and clean drinking water.

Art – Yep, and she called evil-incarnate.
 Ignoring my family was one of the reasons she sited.
 If it hadn’t of happened to me, then the irony would have had me rolling on the floor laughing my ass off.
 Karen – Embarrassing things are so much funnier when they happen to strangers.
 It always hurts when they happen to you, and some other jerk finds it funny.
 Art – Isn’t life grand.
 I’m feeling a might thirsty, would you care to join me over some coffee?
 Karen – That is cliché.
 Art – Give me some time, it’s been a while since I asked a girl out.
 I’ve forgotten a lot of my old lines, besides I don’t really need to break the ice, we’ve been talking for a while now.

Singhelm had long since passed away, while Ceredon remained, two hundred years older, as the leader of the elven elite Ekreissar.
 It was in that clearing Antonil halted his army.
 The men shuffled around nervously, their eyes searching for enemies that always seemed to be hiding beyond their vision.
 The guard captain unrolled the edict, his gut sinking as he realized where he stood.
 Long ago, man and elf had agreed to live together in peace.
 Now, on that very same spot, he would rescind that agreement.
 Beyond the clearing loomed several palisades.
 All nearby windows were closed, and several boarded.
 A few humans stuck their heads out their doors to glimpse the armored men trampling through their city.
 Most kept themselves far from danger.

“We…‌Qurrah…‌I don’t know.”
 “No,” she said, leaning on her staff.
 “Why did you save me?”
 He kicked his toes into the dirt, unable to piece together the chaotic mess inside his head and heart.
 All he could think of was what his brother had told him to do.
 “Qurrah said to kill you if I didn’t love you…”
 “Yet you didn’t,” she said.
 Harruq nodded, but said nothing else.
 “ _Hana fael!_ ” a voice cried from far down the alley.
 Both turned to see an elf raise his bow and fire.

The ultimate determinant of the number and quality of jobs in future will not be physical or even financial constraints, but – ‘science, technology, values and social organization – in a word, the human imagination’.
 Trading Jobs
 Those in the West who do not blame rising unemployment on technological advancement, usually blame it on trade.
 Business and economic literature is replete with articles stating that the high-wage industrial nations will suffer rising levels of unemployment due to the growth of imported goods from low-wage developing countries.
 The completion of the Uruguay round of GATT trade negotiations was delayed for years because this view fostered protectionist sentiment in the bastion of free trade Western nations.
 This issue elicits heated emotional debate that often overlooks obvious facts.
 For instance, increasing trade with East Asia and with low-wage developing countries is cited as a major cause of the fall in the wages of unskilled workers in the United States.
 As in the case of technology, there is evidence that free trade destroys jobs in some industries, especially unskilled or low-skilled jobs in high-wage economies.
 In some instances the devastating impact of increasing imports may justify a gradual approach to removing trade barriers.
 However, the overall impact of manufactured exports from developing countries has been vastly exaggerated.

The newcomer whispered to him, and Chevelle’s eyes flicked my direction more than once.
 Curiosity burned through me.
 And then a delicate hand reached out to pass Chevelle a package.
 Her fingers lingered against his during the exchange and my chest felt like it was blistering inside.
 They were whispering about me.
 My watcher.
 This woman.
 Chevelle’s gaze brushed mine once more and I hungered to hear what they were saying.
 I was fixated on it, my mind spinning, convinced that if I were as invisible as everyone thought, if they truly couldn’t see me, at least I could get closer and finally know.
 As I shook my head at the idea, my eyes fell downward.

The bedroom doors had been kicked in, and broken bongs and stem pipes, empty cigarette packs, matchbooks, just trash littered every surface.
 I don’t know what the hell these people (my son!)
 did in here, but the carpet could not have been dirtier if they raised farm animals indoors.
 Pictures of Brandon and his friends holding automatic weapons were nearly the only things upright.
 Sex toys filled the drawers and around his bed.
 Apparently, it had been a real bohemian festival at some point, at least to the people who hung here.
 Everything was broken or ajar, apparently ransacked while Brandon was in jail.
 Nearly all of his belongings that were worth anything were stolen by the scumbags who had been his peers.
 We heard Brandon’s girlfriend, Tiffanie, was afraid to return to the house while our son was in jail and it was probably the smartest thing she had done in years.
 Brandon had accumulated flat screen TV’s, computers, stereo equipment, guns, you name it and it was all gone.

He didn't respond right away.
 "It won't be any easier tomorrow.
 And I can't promise I'll be able to stop myself if we start-start kissing again."
 He was right.
 And she didn't think she'd stop him even knowing that they would end up making love.
 Half an hour later Marie sat up.
 "I guess I'd better go get dressed."
 "OK." "I'm not going to take a shower.
 I've lain with you all night, and I want to have your scent on me as long as possible."
 He smiled a bit.

"Really?
 What do you do at all those garden parties?"
 He laid the chicken on the grill.
 "Gossip and eat little sandwiches and sip tea."
 "Sounds like fun."
 He rolled his eyes.
 She sat down in a lounge chair on the patio.
 "Life should be terribly exciting for me.
 Having fun is important in 1927--dancing, music, pictures--all kinds of merriment.
 And my father is wealthy.

Hundreds of soldiers stacked against it, their shields braced and ready.
 All along the walls, archers released arrow after arrow into the darkness.
 “How are we to get closer?” Qurrah asked.
 “Ignore them,” Harruq said.
 “I know what I’m doing.”
 He led them into an alley in between several worn buildings made of stone.
 He stopped just before the next set of homes, for he heard talking.
 Holding Qurrah back, he peered around the corner to find a soldier dressed in finely polished armor raising his sword in salute.
 At first Harruq did not see who he saluted, but an elf fell from the roof and landed before the soldier.
 “An elf,” Harruq whispered, managing to grab Qurrah’s attention.

 Jim – Not a good way to start a tradition.
 Art – Nope, it could be worse though.
 Jim – Yes it could, it could have karaoke as an integral part of the ceremony.
 Art – Dad has more taste then that, not by much, but enough.
 What do you plan to do about Liz?
 Jim – I don’t know.
 I mean, she’s my best friend, and she’s in love with me.
 Art – We’ve covered that.

I didn’t really have anything to assemble.
 There was only the pack I’d acquired months ago, nothing in it but that stupid white dress and the pouch… The pouch.
 I hurried from the room, explaining to Ruby I would be getting ready for the trip.
 “I already put your pack in the front room for Chevelle.” “I’ll just check it,” I said.
 “Thanks.” I found the pack with some of Chevelle’s things.
 As I started to open it, I knocked one of his bags over and went to pick it up.
 The flap was loose and a piece of familiar fabric hung out.
 I glanced over my shoulder to be sure Ruby wasn’t watching, and opened the bag to find the fabric-wrapped package she’d handed to Chevelle our first day here.
 The package he’d traded my stone for.
 I pulled the material back to reveal a leather-bound book.

When she didn't look away, simply continuing to gaze into his eyes, he slowly lowered his mouth to hers, brushing his lips over hers.
 She didn't pull away.
 Gathering her closer, he kissed her gently.
 Marie's pulse raced as Rick's lips moved over hers.
 This .
 .
 .
 this was nothing like Davis's kisses.
 Rick's kiss was making her tremble.
 She returned it briefly and then pulled away, hiding her face against his shoulder in confusion.

Marie could tell that something was in the air that day.
 Her father and Davis kept exchanging looks over lunch, and they didn't shoo her and her mother from the table right after lunch so that they could discuss business.
 She suspected that Davis had something special planned for that evening, and when she caught her mother's glance over their teacups, she knew right away that her mother shared her suspicions.
 He took her to a French restaurant in the Back Bay, not far from her house.
 "Is your veal good?"
 he asked her after sampling his own.
 "Delicious.
 And yours?"
 "Fine."
 He seemed preoccupied, so she just concentrated on enjoying her food, the candlelight, and the music.

Adriana, go ahead and get started on your homework.
 When you finish come find me and we'll get you situated."
 As always, Rachel was sitting at her table in the middle of no-man's-land.
 She looked up at me and smiled as I took my usual spot and started on my homework.
 For the first time all day I felt like I could relax.
 The few times I looked up, I saw Britney, who seemed determined not to give in and actually do her homework.
 I finished my two assignments about the time I normally did, and walked over to where Mrs. Campbell was trying to explain a story problem.
 The sophomore she was helping looked like he wanted to be anywhere other than trying to figure out how long it would take Sally to mow the lawn given a certain width of lawn mower moving at a given rate of speed.
 "Oh, Adriana.
 Go ahead and walk around looking for students who need help.

He smiled back and continued.
 “The faery could have easily stabbed me through the heart but he didn't because he wanted me alive; to give to Kojas.” Emily gasped and covered her face.
 “Why, what would he want with you?” Seth closed his eyes.
 “He's saying that I'm going to be his key to success, in taking over Igneeria and Earth.
 He wants to use me, I don't know how yet.
 They're going to do whatever they can to bring me to him; I'm going to have to be extra careful.
 I don't know-” “Seth,” Jason interrupted him.
 Seth looked up at his best friend.
 “Seth,” Jason repeated, “you aren't alone.
 Kojas isn't going to get a chance to use you because he's going to have to get through me first.” “And me,” Emily added.

I mean, unless it's bothering you.
 You know, keeping you from patrolling or something."
 That last bit hadn't really been planned.
 I'd wanted to come downstairs and talk to him, but wouldn't have dreamt of just saying it outright.
 Maybe it was the natural high I got simply from being around him.
 Alec's smile was brief, but it felt like the first one I'd seen since he'd been forced to save me.
 I couldn't blame him for being worried about how this was going to further strain already tense relations with Brandon's pack.
 Still, the transforming expression made me realize just how badly I'd missed his other face, the one that wasn't stern and serious all of the time.
 "No, you're not bothering me in the slightest.
 Jasmin or Isaac either one could easily keep watch.

We figured you wanted some privacy with Isaac, or we would've dragged you over here hours ago."
 The rest of us were quick to pipe in, but at least on my side, the sentiment was a little half-hearted.
 Unlike Jasmin, Jessica never had come around, never made her peace with the fact that because of me things were going to go downhill in a hurry after tonight.
 I'd tried to get both Rachel and Dominic to explain why she hated me so much, but neither would give me a real explanation.
 Rachel would always just get mad and say there was no excuse for how Jess was acting.
 Dominic always refused to say anything other than that Jessica had been through her own set of struggles, and had her reasons for her behavior.
 "I'll be done with Dom in just a moment, Jess, then I'll fix your hair while Rachel finishes up with Adri."
 The nickname should have hurt, but somehow it wasn't as bad when the pack used it.
 It was almost like having a new family, one without all of the grief-poisoned memories that popped up every time I really thought about Dad or Cindi.
 Faster than I would've believed possible, we were all in our dresses, and waiting in the living room for the boys to make their appearance.

“Stay safe, friend,” he said.
 “You as well, friend.”
 Before the elf took to the sky, however, he paused.
 “Antonil…‌something more is at work here.
 Be wary.
 I will not take sides in this conflict, and neither shall the Quellan elves, but if I find who caused this war, I will kill him.
 It is the least I can do.”
 A great beat of white wings and then the elf was in the air.
 Antonil watched him fly far south, watched until he was a tiny white dot among a blanket of stars.
 Before he stopped watching, however, he saw more than fifty similar white dots line the horizon.

“Never dis facts.
 They might save you later in life.” Seth just snorted.
 Jason punched him in the side.
 “Listen to Emily.
 She’s actually right sometimes.” “Thank you, Jason.” She said cheerfully, “Huh wait, sometimes?” She raised an eyebrow at him.
 Jason scowled at her.
 “I’m admitting you’re sometimes right so don’t push it.” “Point taken.” She tucked the paper in her drawstring bag.
 “You guys want to go to the park?” They both half nodded, half shrugged, which she took for a yes.
 So we got up and mounted our bikes.
 I threw the bike lock in my bag, clipped on my helmet, and followed the others.

Laura was the other first-period office monitor.
 They skipped down the halls, holding hands and laughing.
 Laura held classroom doors open.
 Eric swooped in with his arms extended like wings, softly humming the Hallelujah chorus from Handel’s Messiah.
 Sunday Kemper was Lane Campbell's new girl.
 She lived a block from our school.
 Her folks either enjoyed our company or preferred to have their daughter at home even if she brought the whole gang with her.
 Their family room had a pool table and a stereo.
 While most of us played eight-ball or listened to Sunday’s dad, Ivan, an engineer, explain how things worked, Eric listened to the Messiah.
 I knew he loved Christmas, which was near.

What I’m saying, in a song like “Love for Lorelei” or “The Golden Apples of the Song”—new stuff, you haven’t heard it yet-- is that, here are my words, man, here’s my life in words.
 What I’m saying is what I mean.
 If I sing “I love you” over and over, that’s truth, man, that’s where I’m coming from, because I mean it, because I’m singing to Lor, and I love her, there’s no secret to it, there’s no murkiness, no florid touches, it’s just raw, like art should be, raw, simple, full of emotion.
 “I Want to Hold Your Ass While You Move”—I wrote that after a particularly beautiful night of lovemaking.
 I don’t care, you know.
 I don’t care if people think it’s too personal, too open, too—what?—minimal or plain and straightforward.
 I mean, some people don’t like that in their art, they can’t take that.
 It’s like Pop Art, which Lor turned me on to.
 What these guys are saying is, it’s simple, man, art is all around you.
 It’s soup cans, it’s goats, it’s flags.

As much as my body had been through in the last few hours, I needed to find shelter before I got chilled.
 The next lightning strike was so close it lit the entire sky up.
 The telltale flash of glass up ahead was just enough to guide me to a door that was nearly hidden by the rampant foliage.
 I pulled the door open with less effort than expected, and slipped inside.
 The heady fragrance of flowers told me immediately what I'd stumbled across.
 "As if there wasn't enough greenery outside, he's got to have an entire greenhouse too."
 The abrupt lessening of the rain assaulting the glass roof brought back my sense of urgency.
 Nobody could possibly find me while the most intense rainstorm since Noah had sealed up the ark was going on, but I couldn't stay here once it stopped.
 I slipped my battered shoes onto my abused feet, and turned to leave just as the door opened of its own accord.
 I fell back in amazement as he stepped into the pool of light that'd materialized as the clouds parted.

How the heck did those people in movies make this look so easy?
 I exchanged a look with Seth, but he looked as clueless as I did.
 None of this felt real.
 I swear, the creature laughed at us.
 Or maybe my fear was making me see and hear things.
 Jason moved silently to stand beside us, one of his throwing knives in his hand.
 “What do we do?
 We’re dead so it can’t hurt us right?” I asked.
 “I don’t feel dead.” Jason whispered.
 I didn’t either.

“I trust little,” Velixar said, stepping through the line of his servants.
 “The truth is I do not take risks.
 If any survived you would have been identified and my plans ruined.”
 Both brothers bowed to their master.
 “What are the plans you speak of?” Harruq asked.
 “In time, my dear bone general, I will tell you both.
 For now though, I must deal with your brother.” Velixar brought his gaze to the young necromancer.
 “Let us return to the village.
 It is time we test your power.”

Ruby must have thought I was sleeping.
 I had no idea what in this journal could be of interest to Chevelle unless he knew the woman, and that kept me reading.
 It continued on—her father’s rigorous schedule, their distaste for her sister—and then the entries got more detailed and frequent.
 Mother has been too ill lately for guests.
 I have not been able to see her.
 The tedium of my duties is getting to me and Father has been relentless with my studies, pushing me harder and harder to strengthen my control.
 My sister has been exploring the mountains.
 I see her bring in all sorts of interesting finds, but she refuses to tell me where she got them.
 I wish there were a way to sneak out.
 I would follow her or force her to show me, but Father is keeping a close eye on me, making certain I stick to a strict schedule.

Amazingly, I walked right up to the one with an arrow on it.
 I looked to the left and saw a door with a sword on it.
 I sighed and pushed open my door.
 The small room also had glass ceilings but they were dimmer.
 The room was dark and cold, with dust in the air.
 “I was wondering when you would get here,” a familiar voice said.
 I jumped and looked into one of the corners.
 The girl from my dreams walked out, shimmering.
 She smiled and I then noticed the bow hanging on her back with a quiver of arrows.
 “You know how you asked for my name before?

It was like I couldn't win.
 If Britney drove all the way out here and I was already gone because I'd taken the bus, she was going to be really mad.
 On the other hand, if she didn't show, I had no other way to get to school, and Mom would freak out.
 Part of the reason she felt like she could be gone so much ever since the accident was the fact that I always did the responsible thing.
 If she started thinking I was cutting class, she was going be furious.
 It would be like I was behaving irresponsibly and taking away her ability to pursue her art, all at the same time.
 It was past time for the bus to arrive, and she still wasn't here.
 A car zipped around the corner driving way too fast, just like Britney always did, but it wasn't white.
 I looked past it, hoping to see another one following it.
 My mouth nearly hit the ground when I recognized the throaty roar and dark paint job of Brandon's Mustang.

Heck, I hardly knew the meaning of the word, but something about Brandon turned it all into a harmless game.
 A game with rules that were nearly comprehensible for a change.
 One where there was very little to lose and an undreamed-of potential for achieving amazing things.
 As soon as the door was shut I ran to the window and hid behind the blinds, watching as the black Mustang drove up our lane.
 Overcome by the sudden urge to giggle, I ran upstairs looking for my mom.
 I made it all the way to her door before remembering the Jeep hadn't been downstairs.
 Typical.
 The one time I had good news, and she wasn't around.
 I wandered back downstairs, more because it was cooler down there than because I had any real desire to work on homework.
 Once I was down there though, I grimly decided to open up my bag and make some progress before Mom got home.

I've already told Lucy where she stands with Ben.
 If you get in my way, if you approach him on her behalf, if you even think of acting on any of the hundred things going through your mind right now, I'll kill you too."
 My knees were weak, but I had to get out now.
 For all that I hated Cassie, there was no way this crazy chick would act on her threats when there were three of us to corroborate each other's stories.
 I quietly swung the stall door open and felt my eyes go wide as I saw Lucy curled up, sobbing, at Jasmin's feet.
 Neither of the other girls even bothered to look at me as I carefully moved to the door.
 Jasmin took half a step to the side, giving me room to get around her, but there wasn't even a slight drop in the level of menace she was radiating.
 It was like I didn't even exist.
 I was still shaking on my way down the hall.
 By the time I made it into Algebra, I thought I was going to throw up.

"Fine.
 I'm doing the laundry."
 "I have a blue shirt hanging on the bathroom doorknob--" "I found it.
 It's in the dryer."
 "Thanks--you're terrific.
 Listen, I called to tell you that I may be a little late tonight."
 "Why?"
 "I have a lot of things to wrap up before the weekend.
 But I have a surprise for you that'll make up for it."
 "It will have to be a really special surprise."

“Of course,” she responded.
 “But it will probably be harder and slower than if you were learning earlier in life.
 It requires relearning something that is almost an instinct at this point in your life.
 Part of the problem is that the spell to activate the magic in the bow is just very different than anything you have probably done before.” Rodregas knew she was speaking the truth.
 He had never thought he was going to be some powerful mage.
 The fact that Doi’van had so easily learned the spell just reminded him of how many times in his life he had failed to have the ability to succeed in things that he really wanted.
 Rodregas’ new body was very gifted, but it was still mortal and some things he would just not be able to do as well as others.
 In some ways this was reassuring, a connection to his past.
 “Can I ask you a question?” she asked.
 Rodregas smiled and said, “of course, what?” “Have you thought of trying to become a sigil warrior?

This was like before The Moratorium, right?
 Before we really all felt the power.
 The War was just this endless one-note playing over and over and driving us insane—me insane, sorry, driving me insane.
 And, like, I know that a song is just a song—yet, I have to believe there is something there, an element, a catalytically charged element.
 I didn’t want religion—who listens to priests, clergymen, even those who take to the streets?
 Ali has more power.
 Ali reaches more people.
 But a song, you know, a good song, well, it does tunnel deep into the consciousness.
 Did I think I could do anything with the right words, well-placed, well-played?
 No.

What do we say, oh sorry about that everyone, we just felt like leaving Earth to go to this magical place called Igneeria to do something that we don’t know about.” “Well of course, there will be some minor difficulties,” he said.
 “Minor?” I squeaked.
 “Seriously, did you not hear a word I just said?” He placed his pudgy hands on his small hips.
 “Miss don’t you think that Her Majesty would have this all planned out?
 You don’t have to worry.” Seth twirled his sword.
 “Why not, we have to tell our parents something.” “Sir, don’t worry about a thing.
 All you need to do is go home.
 Everything has been arranged.” “What do you mean, arranged?” Seth asked sharply.
 The dwarf seemed to bounce up and down.
 “It has sir, but I don’t know what her majesty did.

Early start today?” My voice was determined.
 “Yes, I want to practice growing.” She glanced at the pendant against my chest.
 She was silent for a moment as she looked into my eyes, almost searching.
 She was probably worried I was sad or missing my mother.
 “Not today.
 It seems I have business with the Council this morning.” Her mouth turned down in a grimace.
 “Oh.” All right, it wasn’t like I didn’t have plenty to do.
 I’d just head to the library and try to find the missing pages to the northern clan documents.
 “Well, I’ll see you then.” I smiled at her and headed around back again to cut through the village.
 I took my time to allow her to make her way to the Council building.

You can go to a Chinese buffet or a Mexican buffet or an American buffet.
 If it's American, there's usually a lot of salad items, chicken, potatoes, different kinds of meats and vegetables.
 Oh--and desserts.
 Tons of desserts--cake, pie, cookies, ice cream .

 "Mmm.
 I'm glad we're eating right now.

 "If you're around long enough, I'll take you to one."

She managed to doze a little but was wide awake before dawn.
 Deciding to do an aerobics tape until it was light enough to walk in the garden, she put on her workout clothes and went downstairs.
 She didn't know how she was going to be able to wait two entire days.
 She was so excited that she felt like she could run all the way to Hollywood.
 After 45 minutes of aerobics, she still wasn't tired!
 She wouldn't be able to sit still and watch TV today.
 She'd do all their laundry and clean the house from top to bottom and have dinner ready when Rick got home.
 She glanced at her watch and decided to get everything ready for breakfast so that it wouldn't take long to cook it for Rick as soon as they got back from her walk.
 She froze in place.
 What if she got back to 1927 today?

Most women can always tell a lie, especially in such a moment of connection as the talk after good sex.
 Luckily, even with far more normal women there is always something good you can say; with Imeralda he could have gone on for hours.
 Imeralda’s eyes lit up in pleasure and humor at his words but, of course, he was careful to say nothing of the future, nothing of love.
 Such talk would serve no purpose and would likely ruin the moment.
 To his surprise she also kept such thoughts to herself.
 The rest of the night, the two lovers spent quietly connected and at peace, but they shared few words.
 In the morning after meditation, Doi’van pulled forth two wooden staves that he had cut and said with a smile and an exaggerated wink, “Apparently you are healed up from your wound now, so I think it is time to stop with these making of shadows like children and time for some more physical training.” As he finished speaking he tossed Rodregas one of the staves.
 “With my people we teach our children to fight using the staff.
 It is hard to kill someone by accident with a staff, but you can still deliver pain.
 The avoidance of pain is a great way to teach someone to be nimble and quick.

I faded in and out of the various discussions, listening occasionally but never talking.
 Steed seemed very aware of me, watching me in a way no one ever had.
 It must have been obvious, because when he excused himself to check the herd, Chevelle studied me, sliding a strand of my now-black hair through his fingers.
 “It suits you.” It was a familiar gesture and it should have made me flinch.
 Maybe it was the wine, but as I looked at him, my anger was fading.
 The way he’d reacted when Fannie had struck me, the caress against my cheek, those were not the actions of a council elder.
 As we sat so near, it was hard to believe the concern wasn’t real.
 His eyes burned with intensity; they seemed even darker now.
 Dark… like mine.
 I looked away.

Finally he got to the top, which was broad and actually rather cup-like against the main trunk.
 Though he worried about Imeralda, he let himself rest for a moment to recover.
 After a few minutes Rodregas got up and looked around for Imeralda.
 He saw that she was actually far out on another impossibly think branch.
 By the Infernals he swore to himself.
 She was a Forest Nymph.
 He thought he should just leave her there.
 She could do this far easier than he.
 Rodregas had an urge to leap from his branch to the other like a cat.
 Maybe he could have made it, but if he missed it was at least a hundred feet down.

Living standards rise as consumers benefit from the availability of lower-priced imported consumer goods.
 One of the greatest barriers to solving the world’s employment problem is the perception that trade destroys jobs.
 As in the case of technology, the interactions are complex and must be viewed in their entirety, rather than in isolated industries.
 The global economy is not a zero sum game in which increased production by one country must necessarily result in reduced production by another.
 Trade opens up new opportunities.
 It permits each country to specialize in industries where it possesses a ‘comparative advantage’.
 This specialization enables it to evolve improved processes to achieve higher levels of quality and productivity, larger production volumes and lower costs.
 This results in higher incomes for its workers and makes their products more affordable in other countries, which in turn raises standards of living abroad.
 The resultant rise in real incomes domestically and overseas stimulates demand for more of these products as well as for other products that can be produced locally or imported from overseas.
 Trade also tends to raise the quality of jobs in an economy.

She could have breakfast ready for him, maybe even serve it to him in bed.
 Jumping up, she pulled on a pair of shorts and a t-shirt and ran downstairs.
 She didn't know how to make very much, but she could scramble some eggs, prepare bacon in the microwave, and make some toast.
 It didn't even take very long.
 She put a glass of juice and a cup of tea for Rick on the tray and a glass of milk for herself.
 Carefully she carried it upstairs.
 Rick was still asleep when she nudged the door open.
 She went in, set the tray on the floor, and then sat beside him.
 "Rick."
 She played with a curl on his forehead.

A flex of his muscles cracked bone, and the sword fell from a limp hand.
 Harruq let him go, bellowed at the first elf, and then hurled both his blades.
 They turned end over end through the air, one missing, one not.
 The one that missed sailed until it hit ground and bounced.
 The hilt of the one that did not smacked him hard in the forehead.
 The elf staggered back, swiping at Harruq as the half-orc charged.
 A thin line of blood appeared on the half-orc’s forehead, but he was oblivious to it.
 His hands were around his enemy’s throat and his strength at its greatest.
 The crunching flesh underneath his fingers was all that mattered.
 The elf behind him retrieved his sword and attacked, his right arm hanging useless, his left stabbing desperately.

Who is God.
 Revising
 While I’m writing all this from notes and memory, I decide to pick up my old hardback of Big Sur.
 I still get moved by Jack Kerouac’s honesty and his pictures of the raw and terrifying beauty of people and things.
 After reading about a drive from Big Sur into Monterrey, I go online and look up pictures of the two real people (to whom the book gives other names) on that drive, Kerouac and Neal Cassady.
 Both men were remarkably handsome, some of God’s finest art, I think.
 Then I remember a character from Ken Kesey’s Sometimes a Great Notion, and I realize that Kesey may have used Neal Cassady, a fellow of wild intellect and passion, and a legendary womanizer, as a prototype for his character Joe Ben.
 Only he revised, changed his life, and made Joe Ben a real hero.
 Remembering that Kesey and Cassady were friends, I look up some dates.
 Sure enough, they met while Kesey was writing that novel, two years before it came out.

Job Creation during the Twentieth Century
 A long-term, global perspective is needed to understand fully the employment problem and the prospects for eliminating it.
 Over the past four decades, the world economy has generated more than one billion jobs, more than were created during the previous four centuries.
 If past trends continue, it will create another 1.3 billion during the next 35 years.
 The current anxiety in the West is similar to that which the United States passed through in the 1890s when agricultural mechanization displaced 4.4 million farm workers, generating double digit unemployment and visions of a dismal future.
 Yet, since then, employment in the United States has expanded by nearly 100 million jobs or 400 per cent.
 Between 1990 and 2005, it is projected to increase by another 25 million.
 The same process of structural transition is repeating itself today and raising the same anxieties.
 Contrary to common belief, the US employment rate, the percentage of total population with jobs, has risen steadily throughout the century from 38 per cent to 46 per cent of the total population and is expected to reach 51 per cent by 2005.
 This trend is true for the industrial nations as a whole.

In some ways it was hard not having her around, but in other ways it was a relief.
 Sometimes she reminded me too much of Dad and Cindi.
 A surge of guilt splashed around inside me at the thought, but it was a realization I'd made weeks ago.
 By now some of the sharper edges to the emotion had worn away.
 I shrugged, dropping my book and binder on the floor next to my bed.
 Dwelling on the guilt would just make me think about why I felt guilty in the first place.
 I'd find myself on the floor with no memory of how I'd gotten there.
 By the time I'd brushed my teeth and finished the rest of my nightly ritual, my mind was wholly in the present, and I was starting to get a little depressed.
 I'd never particularly fit in back home, but there'd been enough other people in various fringe groups that I'd always felt like I had somewhere to go if I ever wanted more friends.
 I would've had to play a role to a certain extent, which was why I'd never made the effort, but the option had always been there.

He was scowling a little again, which almost made me get out without saying anything.
 My thanks received only a nod in return, and then Rachel was waving goodbye as they backed down the lane.
 The Jeep was gone, of course.
 I wiped away the beginnings of perspiration as I climbed our steps.
 It was still hot enough outside that I knew it was going to be miserable inside.
 By the time I reached the door I was contemplating just finding a decent tree and spending the afternoon outside.
 The sight of a white envelope, barely visible against the off-white door, was enough to drive those thoughts out of my head.
 It had my name on the side that'd been facing the door.
 I pulled it down as I walked inside the house.
 Mom was gone, there wasn't any reason I couldn't read whatever was in the envelope in the living room, but I found myself quickly climbing up our creaky stairs and closing my bedroom door behind me.

The process of sorting the books and then getting them to burn took several hours and he started to feel how long it had been since his new body had slept.
 The sound of the tower was changing, the first sounds of the kitchen crew getting ready for the morning.
 Still he kept at it, though there seemed to be nothing else of wealth in the room.
 He was determined to see the evil books burn.
 They held the secrets to the Immortalist art and other dark magic.
 Leaving them would only lead to another person rising in Ravenhurr’s place.
 Several of the foulest books seemed to refuse to burn but the flames eventually consumed all, just as they had consumed Ravenhurr.
 Finally, the last of the dark books of magic were burned, and the few remaining books that felt of magic but lacked the evil stench of the others were packed in the trunk.
 Only six volumes had been free of the stench, while over forty were burned.
 The sun was now streaming into the room and he was feeling the lack of sleep.

It was like my subconscious hadn't ever seen that part of the landscape.
 Only that didn't make sense.
 How could I not have seen part of whatever it was I was looking at?
 Unless it'd been blocked by something.
 But if so I would have drawn whatever it was that'd been in the foreground.
 I was even worse than normal when it came to drawing people or animals, but I had a good memory for everything else.
 I pushed the notepad away in frustration, and then started shaking as I finally recognized my drawing.
 It was the grotto from my dream, and the reason I hadn't filled in the center was that I'd never seen it.
 That was the spot where Alec had been standing.

Well, two towns really, Celed and Singhelm.
 They have since grown together and merged.
 It is an interesting place, Harruq, where elves and men live together, each in their respective parts of the city.
 Their tolerance of other races is, obviously, a necessity.
 I have thought to take us there.”
 “Why do we need to leave?”
 “Your work is almost done,” Qurrah said.
 “The walls are repaired, and half the men who worked with you have already been cut loose.
 I, however, have much to learn but cannot do so here because of prying eyes and attentive ears.
 I need privacy.

His eyes went back and forth from his own name and Qurrah’s.
 “You spelled my name wrong,” Harruq said.
 “What?
 How?”
 The half-orc reached over, erased the k in his name and drew a clumsy, capitalized Q at the end.
 He leaned back and smiled.
 The name in the dirt now read ‘HarruQ’.
 “Why did you change it?” she asked.
 “It’s a rather odd spelling.”
 “Look at my brother’s name,” he said.

“Where is everyone?” he asked Doi’van.
 Doi’van did not look up from the ground where he was trying to straighten out a shield without doing more damage and said, “I wondered that myself.
 Apparently most drop out by this point.
 A lot have been injured, especially during yesterday’s sword and shield competition, and many simply quit due to not having any points yet.
 If you are going into the most dangerous part of the competition to be injured or killed and you have only one or two points, why bother?” Doi’van said.
 “To be honest, I am surprised how many are left.
 There are still quite a few young fools out there.” “So how many are left now?” Rodregas asked.
 “Fifty-four, on my last count,” Doi’van said.
 Rodregas was a little worried about his shield and wondered if he should jump in and rescue it from the powerful grip of the Hellborn, but he held his tongue and let Doi’van handle the equipment.
 “I see you are employing the forces of the Infernal Realm to aid you in the joust,” said a voice behind Rodregas.

Such a force, if established, is likely to be relatively small, however, and unequal to the task of dealing with threats from a major army equipped with sophisticated weapons.
 In addition, its deployment would always be subject to veto by any of the five permanent members of the Council.
 For both these reasons, it cannot constitute a reliable mechanism for guaranteeing the security of UN member countries.
 Although a strengthening of the UN’s peace-keeping capabilities is highly desirable, it cannot serve as an adequate foundation for a cooperative security system unless the UN’s political structure is radically modified.
 Because it is essentially an addition to national forces rather than a substitute for them, funding will be a perennial difficulty and there will be strong resistance to its expansion on economic grounds.
 Furthermore, as recent events have demonstrated, nations contributing their forces will have a strong propensity to resist their active deployment in situations that involve significant risks.
 Even after the Security Council decided to send a peace-keeping force into Rwanda for strictly humanitarian purposes, none of the leading military powers, with the exception of France, were willing to contribute the modest amount of military equipment urgently needed to protect UN troops.
 Similar efforts are in various stages of maturity for establishing standing international forces at the regional level in Western Europe, Latin America and other places as part of collective security arrangements.
 The limitation of these proposals, like that of NATO and the erstwhile Warsaw Pact, is that they are fundamentally exclusive in nature and could easily become competitive with other forces as the East and West blocs have in the past.
 The strong resentment voiced by Russia at the proposal that some Eastern European nations would join NATO illustrates the danger of expanding exclusive military clubs.

I was just about to turn the handle when she said, “Jazell, don’t be scared to bring out your emotions.
 They make you stronger.” I looked over my shoulder to see June standing stiffly.
 “Thanks,” I whispered.
 “Thanks June.” “Good luck, Jazell.” I opened the door and saw that Emily and Jason were also coming out of their rooms.
 Emily looked a little shaken but she gave me a thumbs-up.
 Good luck, June’s voice whispered one more time.
 Yeah, I was going to need it.
 Big time.
 Seth, I’m coming, I thought, and I meant it.
 Hold on.

“For the King will rule all, with his cruelty and rage.
 I wouldn’t want to be that half-ling, that he spears through the head!” This time they were rolling on the floor, howling in laughter.
 Well, I didn’t think this was very funny at all.
 What was funny about getting speared through the head?
 I had a feeling the King they were talking about was Kojas, and I really didn’t want to be around to meet him, especially if it meant my head was going to become well acquainted with a weapon.
 That is, if I was even a half-ling like the dwarfs claimed I was.
 They laughed and sat in a tight circle mumbling things I didn’t catch.
 My hand slipped to my knife but Emily grabbed my hand to keep me from drawing it from its leather case.
 “No Jazell not yet, maybe we can learn a little more from them.” Her voice was a hoarse whisper.
 “But Emily, it’s awful to listen to.

"You're going to be an extra.
 You won't say anything, and it'll only be a couple of minutes.
 It's really not much, but it's hard to--" "I'm going to be in a movie!"
 She turned and threw her arms around him.
 She was in a party scene, one of six people that formed a group with the star.
 She wasn't supposed to do anything but smile and sip her drink, but when the star gave her a smoldering glance during rehearsal, the director decided he wanted to film it.
 The result was a split-second close-up of her face, and the star kissed her hand.
 Marie felt as if she were going to burst from excitement.
 They were allowed to watch filming until lunch, and then they were given a tour of the rest of the studio.
 Marie heard obscenities and shouting, and she saw two different actors storm off two different sets in the middle of their scenes.

"That's the best bite of sweet and sour chicken I've ever had."
 Chuckling, she took another piece and fed it to him.
 "This really is messy."
 Rick grabbed her wrist when she started to reach for a napkin.
 He leaned forward, taking her forefinger into his mouth and licking off the sweet and sour sauce.
 Heat flooded Marie's body.
 She watched, helpless, as Rick continued to suck on her finger, his tongue caressing it.
 He raised his eyes to hers as he freed her finger.
 "Better?"
 She felt paralyzed.

Only very sick, masochistic people buy calendars with this kind of crap on it.
 Sane people take pictures of furry little animals romping around green landscapes and sell those.
 That helped a little, my breathing was starting to slow back down, but that was too related to the other reasons we'd moved.
 I wasn't mentally back in safe territory still.
 I sought refuge in something even more mundane.
 Namely the fact that tomorrow I would have to go enroll in school and try to blend in with a bunch of small-town juniors who'd all probably known each other since they could walk.
 Going to a new school after missing the first month of classes was a prospect likely to generate anxiety in the most outgoing of teenagers, and I was far from that, but it was a different kind of worry.
 As I mapped out all of the things that could, and probably would, go wrong, I could feel my heart slowly settle back down out of my throat.
 If I were pretty or athletic I'd probably manage to fit right in.
 It always seemed like the kids who moved in partway through the year usually had some kind of instant in with the cool crowd, but that probably wouldn't happen for me.

It was not unusual for Dino’s associates to come to the house with weapons inside their jackets.
 When they played poker, stacks of hundred dollar bills spilled across the table, and one of the requirements to sit at the table was to put your gun in a pile of weapons across the room.
 I guess they didn’t want the loser to play his trump card with a pistol!
 My brother and I hustled drinks for them for small tips.
 After we were told to go to bed, we would hide behind the counter that blocked the table where they played cards.
 We could stay there late into the night and hear details of these shady lives.
 They all had odd nicknames.
 One man was called “The Painter” and I have no idea where the name came from but I did know that if they needed someone’s house “painted” that this man was going there to kill them.
 He was a hit man, plain and simple!
 Their conversations were graphic.

Qurrah walked over and put a hand on Harruq’s shoulder.
 “You may be with whoever you wish, my dear brother.
 Just do not try to deceive me.”
 Harruq nodded.
 “Alright, then you can come this morning.
 We’ve got to hurry though, or we’ll be late.”
 “I am ready,” Qurrah said.
 “When _you_ are ready, lead on.”
 The big half-orc flew about their home, grabbing his old swords and donning his faded leather armor.
 When ready, he nodded to Qurrah, who let out a rare laugh.

Presents, eggnog and the Christmas story.
 Usually Dad made us breakfast Christmas morning and then we'd drive out of the city later in the day and go sledding.
 I hadn't thought about what it would be like this year."
 Alec nodded like he'd just checked a box off on some kind of mental list.
 "So snow's always been a pretty key ingredient sounds like."
 "I guess.
 It hadn't really sunk in that we wouldn't be getting any of that this year.
 A month ago I would have thought that was a good thing, that it would be one less thing to remind me of Dad and Cindi.
 I think I might actually miss it this year though."
 I rested my head against Alec's shoulder.

It stretched out long enough that for a moment I didn't think he was going to answer, but then he nodded, a long deliberate motion that left no question but that it was a confirmation.
 I wanted to ask more, but didn't want to venture into the kinds of things that would get him in trouble with Alec.
 We walked for another minute or so before I was struck with the silliness of someone who was old enough to be my great grandfather calling me 'Mistress Paige.'
 "Donovan, you could just call me Adri if you want."
 "That would hardly be appropriate, mistress."
 "It just seems silly.
 I mean, I'm not really part of the family or anything, so there isn't really a need, is there?"
 Donovan's smile was incredibly gentle as he shook his head in disagreement.
 "You're very much a part of the family, and if I may be so bold, I'm quite delighted by your inclusion.
 I've not seen Mistress Rachel or Master Alec this content in more years than I like to think about.

My head was swirling with all that had happened, not simply my new tutor but the magic.
 On my way out I walked past the shelf that hid the body of the now-dead bird.
 I’d never been able to move objects, but it seemed I had done it without thinking.
 And it wasn’t just that, but the thistle.
 I needed to see Junnie.
 The door was partially open when I reached Junnie’s house, so I peeked my head in and called for her.
 When she didn’t answer, I slipped in to check the back room.
 As I walked through the sparsely decorated living area, I passed a carved mirror on the wall and noticed something off in my reflection.
 I knew I was flushed, I could feel the frustration and worry, but I stopped to get a closer look.
 There was something not right with my complexion, but what was really off was just above my face.

The wind picked up around me, as if a wind current had just appeared out of nowhere.
 5… My body started to feel hot, like I was being hugged by the sun.
 I hated this part.
 4… Power surged through me as I was freed from my human self.
 Shivers ran down my spine.
 3… I felt cold, like being dipped in ice water.
 The breeze picked up even harder.
 2… I was hollow and could probably see my own body if I opened my eyes.
 But I could never get the courage to do that.

 Doctor – (startled) I am writing notes on your fascinating case, it’s a thing that we doctors do you know.
 Ya, we doctors write notes all the time, in fact I am writing them now.
 Character 1- (reaches for the clipboard) May I see the notes?
 Doctor – (slaps the incoming hand, and clutches the clip-board to his chest) Nein!
 These are confidential, and, uhhhh, it would violate the doctor-patient relationship if I allowed you or anyone to see them.

 Doctor – yes, please do.

Our lecture essentially consisted of an extended review, which I quickly realized I didn't need.
 I broke out my book and started in on one of my catch-up assignments instead.
 At the rate I was going I'd be able to take my makeup exam way ahead of schedule.
 It was a pretty lame thing to be excited about, but just having something going well for a change helped compensate for the rest of my life.
 Amazingly enough, the satisfaction from having accomplished so much shielded me for most of the rest of the day.
 I withstood Britney's varied, mostly unsubtle, attempts to make me feel guilty for not spilling my guts about whatever big secret she thought I had, and even held up through the complete boredom that was Mr. Simms' class.
 It wasn't until I walked into Physics that I felt the cold hand of reality reach out and caress the back of my neck.
 Alec was uncharacteristically early, already sitting at his normal desk.
 He looked up and briefly met my eyes when I reached my desk, but there wasn't even a trace of acknowledgment in his gaze.
 Mrs. Alexander started class, reviewed a couple of points that other groups needed clarified, and then released us to work on our assignments.

I was a little surprised by how satisfying it was to have him, a demigod, on the run, but I didn't let it slow me down.
 "The fact that I, a little waif from out of town, could defuse the situation and save Rachel no doubt sticks in your craw, which explains why you're lurking around out here waiting to talk to me.
 Because only then can you fabricate some reason for why everything had to go down the way it did, and thereby save face!"
 He wasn't flinching now.
 Instead his face had gotten tight and remote.
 For a second it seemed like he was looking right through me.
 "You don't understand."
 Alec's expression should have scared me.
 It sent shivers down my spine, but I was too mad to back down over a little thing like my knees nearly shaking.
 "Of course.

Inadequate job/livelihood opportunities resulting in inadequate purchasing power have now become the most important cause of endemic and hidden hunger.
 Most regrettable has been the failure to enhance the powers and strengthen reliance on effective multilateral institutions.
 The emergence of the USA as the sole superpower has brought with it a reduction in the role and influence of the UN in international affairs, precisely at a time when the world should be striving to build a viable multilateral cooperative security system.
 The Unfinished Agenda
 The Commission’s report was never intended to predict what would happen in the years to come, but rather to project what could be made to happen by a concerted, determined effort of the world community.
 The report highlighted many of the opportunities that did emerge as well as some of the dangers that have grown in intensity in the absence of effective action.
 The events of the past 15 years may not have followed the course predicted by either the optimists or the pessimists, but they certainly confirm that this has been a period of unprecedented opportunity for rapid progress – what Sri Aurobindo termed an “Hour of God”.
 While the gains have been significant, all of us will acknowledge that we have not taken full advantage of this opportunity to build a better world.
 Though great dangers have receded, old and new threats still loom large, demanding courageous action.
 The door remains ajar.

It directs your magic and focuses it as the Tree of Life wants it, but not by binding it into a shape.
 It heals your spirit and makes you more…, well, more of a Nymph,” she said, her voice was a tone of sunlight and happiness.
 For reasons Rodregas did not understand he felt great.
 “So, why do you have to climb up a hundred feet to the end of a branch to get a blessing from a tree?” Imeralda laughed and then yelled down to Doi’van, “Take your boots off and your harness and your weapons and climb up on the top of one of the big roots.
 That should work, you have to be on the One Tree and then I will show you the blessing.” Doi’van looked like he wanted to argue but with Rodregas’ nod of encouragement he followed her request, and Imeralda stepped closer and she held three golden fruits.
 The fruits looked like giant acorns, but rounder and softer.
 She handed Rodregas one and then waited for Doi’van to follow her instructions.
 Then, warning him to be ready, she dropped down one of the fruits which he caught with his normal grace.
 “Stay on the root,” she warned him.
 “You cannot take one of the blessings off the tree; it will wither and die if you try.” She winked at Rodregas as she said this.

She watched as Harruq struggled through some sort of internal debate.
 His brown eyes finally rose to meet hers.
 “Qurrah’s like you, but not.

 “Well, he can too.
 But he…‌ he’s different.

 It was dead as dead can be.
 He closed his hands around it, just like this, and then whispered some words he learned from secretly watching Master.”
 “Master?” Aurelia asked, interrupting him again.

 Is that clear?”
 “Yeah,” Harruq said.
 “Now will you let me down?”
 For a moment, she said nothing, catching her breath and doing her best to calm the flood of adrenaline that still rushed through her.

 Blood continued to trickle down his chin.
 “I’m not blind,” she said, suddenly looking away.
 “Not stupid, either.

 He extended the bowl, and she touched the food.

 She looked at him in wonder.

I realized Chevelle was watching me, waiting for the stone.
 Shaking free of the thoughts, I removed the pouch from my pack to untie the lacing.
 I reached inside, wondering momentarily what else might be written in the ancient language on the scroll.
 I handed the dark red stone to Chevelle, who only nodded as he took it from me, not examining it before he slipped it into a pocket to hide it away.
 There was a sound at the door and his fingers slid over my lower back, urging me into my room.
 I was closed in just as the main door opened, giving me no more than a glimpse of deep red curls.
 I tried not to be annoyed about being closed in a room.
 I was a prisoner after all.
 Chevelle’s voice was barely audible as he spoke to his visitor in a formal tone.
 “Ruby.” Ruby?

 Well maybe girls who might one day marry a guy with the name Eugene.
 In fact I bet mom’s all over the country use that as a threat ‘eat yer peas or else maybe you’ll end up marrying a guy named Eugene.’  I bet it works too.

He was not held to the same rules as everyone else.
 So it goes with the great.
 And when Buddy started using drugs, mixing bennies, reds and laxatives in dangerous quantities, no one was there to question him.
 Of course, drugs were part of the scene then.
 They were everywhere.
 In the back of every minibus, in the bathroom of every nightclub, at practice sessions, in the homes of every groupie.
 And Buddy had his groupies.
 The twins used to joke that Buddy played for scrimption and blow jobs.
 This has some truth to it—the money wasn’t great in those days, asking for more money seen as bourgeois or worse—but the women were wonderful.
 Buddy, though, let it be said, played for one pure reason in those halcyon days.

 But then on top of that Johnny and Gene actually got along well.

 That’s not the weirdest thing, but you get the point.

 Jim – Yep
 Liz – Did we find anything or do anything interesting?
 Jim – The first thing we found was a closet full of old clothing.
 By the way, you look good in green.
 After that we wandered around and talked to a couple of ghosts.

And then I told Doi’van to throw me at Van’dret.” “That was a crazy chance, as an Immortalist he could have split you in two with his bare hands,” said Rodregas.
 “I know,” she said, her voice a little shaken.
 “But we were out of options and it was the only thing I could think of.” Then she added with more confidence, “Plus, while everyone knows a knight might learn a bit of magic, a sorcerer never learns to fight.
 They have servants for that.” The three shared a smile at that.
 Rodregas was very glad that he had insisted that she learn the fundamentals of blade work.
 “So what now?” he asked.
 “Now we go see if we can get some greater sigils,” said Doi’van.
 “We?” Rodregas asked.
 “And have you decided to take a greater sigil even it if cost you most of your magic?” Doi’van nodded and said, “Yes, I like to learn magic, but we are on a mission, one that is very important.
 The Immortalists, especially Taiga, must be stopped.

She'd wanted to see everything, experience everything they'd let her try.
 Everyone had treated her like an eager tourist, little realizing that she was seeing it all from the perspective of someone who'd seen debuts of Hollywood's earliest offerings.
 "Would you like to go dancing?"
 Rick asked as he paid the bill.
 "I don't think so.
 I'm rather tired, and I think I'd just like to relax and think about all that happened today."
 "And dream about your debut?"
 He smiled.
 "We'll go see the movie as soon as it comes out.
 And buy the video when it comes out."

For the next few seconds at least I was safe, could think about anything I wanted without fear of the repercussions.
 Only Rachel was talking, ruining my concentration, so the only thing I could focus on was her words.
 "The rumor revolves around the fact that you tragically lost your boyfriend in a vicious car wreck."
 The immunity meant I hadn't expected the words to hurt, hadn't expected the flash of surprise that spiraled up from my center.
 The words were close to the truth, but not right somehow.
 "He was someone special, some of the rumors put him as some kind of model or actor, or maybe a semi-pro athlete.
 You'd been dating for two years, and were in the car with him when it happened.
 It was so devastating that you've had a hard time dealing with certain things since the accident.
 Being in cars that are driven too fast, mention of the wreck, other assorted things, and sometimes things nobody would expect trigger an attack."
 The words were striking into my mind with such force I almost forgot Rachel was whispering.

Don’t you see that?
 My friends, my family, my home; they are all gone from me.
 Because of you.
 Don’t make it all for nothing.”
 Harruq’s anger and frustration simmered and swirled in a dying fire.
 He could not argue with her, not about that.
 Even he could see what she had sacrificed to save his life.
 “Where do we go?” he asked, his voice revealing his defeat.
 “We’ll figure it out in the morning.
 For now, we travel north.

There were only about twenty Ravenhurr guardsmen.
 If they were sent in every possible direction, especially in pairs, there was a good chance that he would come across no more than two of them at a time.
 If they were still confused about whether he was or was not Ravenhurr, he would have an excellent chance of overcoming them.
 On the other hand, if the forces of the guild came after him… The guardsmen of the Immortalist guild were known as the Immortal Guards and their reputation as the premier fighters of the realm was seldom questioned.
 If they found out what had happened at Raven Keep there was not much chance for Rodregas’ survival.
 After a simple meal, a good rub down for the horses and a few hours of rest, Rodregas got the wagon back on the road.
 If he could keep up this pace, up he could be well hidden before any forces could find him.
 At the end of the second day, before he had come to his last turn off, he realized that he would have to get some sleep.
 He was feeling exhausted.
 His body might be surprisingly strong and quick but apparently it still needed to sleep on a regular basis.

“You can't even hold a weapon.
 So how are you going to save your friends?” I didn't know what it was talking about until I looked over.
 Seth was stiff and frozen, his eyes following one of the snake creatures that was climbing its way up his leg.
 It twisted itself around his arm and brushed onto his neck.
 Seth swung his sword at the back of the snake but there was a flash and it sliced his arm instead.
 He winced and dropped his weapon.
 The snake had wrapped around his neck and was squeezing.
 I gripped my knife but stopped when the creature snickered from the ground.
 “I wouldn't do that if I were you,” it said.
 “That wouldn't be wise.” “Why?” I demanded.

No way to know for sure, but they did not rip him apart, so we will say he was very brave and not very stupid.” Then he added, “Of course, if you had asked me before hand, I would have said that taking food from a Dire Cat was a very stupid idea.” He finished with a smile full of sharp teeth almost a match for the lions and in a casual movement lowered his horned head in what Rodregas thought might be his equivalent of a shrug.
 The next morning they repeated the Morning Prayer and meditation ritual.
 This time while Doi’van joined in, Imeralda mostly watched.
 Afterwards Rodregas said to both, “I have been thinking that we are probably going to be here a few weeks while I finish healing up from the knife wound.
 I want to make the most of the time.” Doi’van said, “I have a feeling that you have some sort of training in mind.” Rodregas nodded and said, “I have developed some bad habits the last few years; I know my technique is rusty and now my timing is all off with my new body.
 I am not sure what your training backgrounds are, though.” He said, waving at Imeralda, who often of late was holding her Black Yew bow close with an intimacy that spoke more of a caress than holding a weapon, “Clearly, Imeralda likes the bow.” Rodregas continued, “Even though Imeralda plans to stay out of the middle of things, learning some basic hand-to-hand and sword fighting is a good idea.
 Doi’van and I can spar with each other, which will help us get used to fighting against the sigil warriors of The Immortal Guard.
 So, I think we should practice every morning until noon, then work to try to get the farm cleaned up during the rest of the day.
 At dusk we can work again on our fighting technique.” Doi’van nodded and said, “Before we battle a group of Immortalists or The Immortal Guards, we need to get some decent armor and weapons.
 They will have the finest equipment that the Guild sorcerers can make or buy.

“So let us dispense with the silly games and lies.
 Let me be clear about something.
 You killed Nordien who was a friend of mine.
 You all die this day.
 There is no need for you to use deceptions or exaggerations.
 You die today either way, so speak the truth and it will be a less interesting death.” Rodregas was furious at himself to be this close to gaining a greater sigil and having achieved knighthood, and then to be caught in a hallway this close to the chamber.
 That, of course, was life.
 There were no simple victories.
 “What do you want to know?” Rodregas asked.
 “An Immortalist sorcerer died recently and then this summer someone ambushed a caravan with fresh stock for the Menagerie.

 Alvrik laughed.
 He nudged the man next to him, who grabbed the quill.
 “Give me your name,” he asked, dabbing the tip into the ink.
 “Harruq,” he said.
 “Harruq Tun.”
 “Well, Harruq,” Alvrik said, slowly nodding his head.
 “I’ll see you right here at sunrise tomorrow.
 Got that?”
 Harruq grinned ear to ear, even his nervousness unable to diminish his excitement.

3.Economic strategy must be balanced: A market economy can be introduced gradually or step-wise, but it cannot be introduced in a fragmentary or piecemeal manner.
 Deregulation of prices was the most prominent feature of the strategy in most countries, because it was the easiest to implement.
 But under conditions of shortages in economies dominated by huge monopolistic enterprises, price deregulation led to skyrocketing prices and spiralling inflation.
 A market flourishes only when several essential conditions are met – freedom of pricing, freedom of entry and exit from industry, free flow of information, unrestricted movement of goods and services, competition between enterprises, control of monopolies, and private ownership of property.
 The entire package of free market practices must be implemented hand in hand, otherwise it does not work.
 Freeing pricing without first regulating or dismantling monopolies, promoting privatization of land and enterprises, ensuring free flow of goods, and establishing wholesale markets and multiple distribution out lets lead to speculation, soaring prices, hoarding and falling production.
 Historically, the free market evolved over centuries in conditions of surplus production and stable currency, neither of which exist in Eastern Europe today.
 Efforts to accelerate the development of the market will have first of all to meet the political, legal, social and economic conditions historically required for its creation.
 And these conditions must be met simultaneously.
 4.Macro-economic stability is a precondition for increasing production: It is extremely difficult to increase production in a context of general macro-economic instability and hyperinflation.

Rachel pulled her books together, and then followed me through the door, James two steps behind, and looking, amazingly enough, even more surly than he had a few seconds before.
 Rachel didn't seem to be one of those people who always had to be talking about something, but even so, two minutes of silence were enough to leave me scrambling for something to talk about.
 "Thanks for telling me about Les Misérables.
 I mean, I should have said thanks yesterday, but I really do appreciate you thinking of me.
 It was really nice."
 Rachel's eyes lit up brighter than I'd seen them in a while.
 "You're welcome.
 Does that mean we can go to Vegas?"
 It seemed like a crime to deny her, but I knew Mom didn't have the spare money to send me on a two-hour trip to an opera.
 I was working now, but by the time I could save up enough to pay for gas, food, and a ticket, the production would've moved on.

Filling in the missing links in the chain of processing and distribution, such as pre-cooling for fruit and vegetables, can enable small farmers to produce for national and export markets; it also results in higher at-farm prices and creates alternative forms of rural employment.
 Empowerment of women
 The vast majority of women living in rural areas are engaged in agriculture.
 Therefore, upgrading productivity, skills and incomes in this sector is the single most effective means of improving the livelihood of women in developing countries.
 Skill development programmes in areas such as hybrid seed production, floriculture, inland aquaculture, vegetables and poultry can be particularly beneficial.
 Promotion of micro-level credit institutions and savings programmes can generate capital for the establishment by women of small rural enterprises.
 FOOD SECURITY IN AFRICA
 The present prognosis for Africa resembles the pessimistic assessment of Asia in the 1960s that projected most Asians would face starvation in the 1970s.
 Over the past two decades, total food production in Africa has grown at exactly the same rate as for the world as a whole, but high levels of population growth have resulted in declining availability of food per capita in many countries, particularly in the sub-Saharan region.
 This suggests that a grim outcome is not inevitable, if concerted action is taken now.

She'd loved the pizza they'd had last night.
 It had been thick and gooey and messy.
 She'd found it both delicious and fun to eat.
 "Maybe tomorrow night.
 I think we need something a little less fattening tonight.
 Why don't I barbecue some chicken?"
 She wrapped potatoes and put them in the oven while he got the grill going.
 "Do you barbecue in 1927?"
 "My family doesn't.
 Other people do."

It doesn’t seem all that important to eat when your world is falling apart.
 How long did it take for Gene to finally snap?
 Jim  - He started spending a lot of time hanging out at their church doing bible lessons.
 He actually applied himself to it, and was pretty good at debating the bible and other religious topics in just a couple of months.
 Gene turned Conservative Christian, it was kind of scary for several months.
 After about three or four months of taking bible lessons they decided to baptize him.
 Art – Three months without offending the entire group and getting him-self kicked out?
 I am indeed impressed by Gene’s willpower, I didn’t know he even possessed that much.
 He didn’t last much longer did he?
 Jim – (shaking his head) No.

"Very well.
 I should send you away for your own protection, but I'm too selfish to do what's best for you.
 Maybe later I'll be able to do what's right, but not right now, not so soon."
 Chapter 22 Rachel met us at the door with a shy smile that let me know any hard feelings would evaporate instantly if I wanted to be friends again.
 Alec put me down with a slight start as soon as he saw his sister.
 I reluctantly let go of him, and covered the last few feet under my own power.
 I gave Rachel a hug as soon as she was within arm's reach.
 "I'm so sorry.
 I've been incredibly dumb."
 She waved the explanation away.

"No.
 That's Dominic's theory, I didn't say it was mine.
 I did what I did because when I close my eyes I still see you there."
 My heart jumped up to my throat, but in a good way.
 "I don't know why, not really.
 Your incredible, unearthly beauty helps, as does your stubborn determination to continue soldiering on, despite how badly you've been hurt.
 That doesn't explain it all though.
 Neither does the fact that you stepped in and saved Rachel from a beating I couldn't stop."
 He reached up and tucked a stray hair behind my left ear.
 "Whatever the reason, since your arrival here, I just feel like parts of me that were missing have come back home.

And there was Dylan with a copy of Teeth Mother Naked at Last.
 And we hugged and, man, it was like, I was set loose.
 I was exonerated for all past sins.
 Dylan knew the writers, you know, he and Ginsberg and the rest of them.
 He was meeting Ferlinghetti there at City Lights and Larry brought Michael and we all just kind of hit it off—you gotta know these guys, I mean, this is what’s real, you know, this, what you can hold in your hand, that’s the kind of guys these guys are.
 You take a book, you can hold it in your hand, and it’s like, it’s already communicating with you, before you even open it.
 And these guys, these poets, man, they are just so honorable.
 And City Lights is a halidom, right?
 You’ve been there?
 Ok, it’s ground zero, as far as I’m concerned.

If not love for your mother, I at least demand the respect that you would give a teacher.
 Are you at least adult enough to handle that Elizabeth?
 Or would you rather we go our separate ways from now on.
 Liz – All right mother, I am interested in hearing what you have to say, though I do question how valid and advice you have about men may be.
 Cleo – Very funny Elizabeth, now if you’re finished…?
 Liz – Yes mother, I’ve nothing else to say for the time being.
 I’m ready to listen to what you have to say.
 Cleo – I doubt that this is the ideal location for a proper mother to daughter talk, but we aren’t exactly the ideal mother and daughter.
 I should have done this a long time ago, but I was busy with other things then… Where to begin.
 With the basics I suppose, you already know about the mechanics of sex, but it’s up to me to fill you in on men themselves.

It’s his voice alright, but there’s an anger there, a tension, that surprised me.
 Buddy Gardner, when I knew him was a sweet, soft-spoken man, a man driven by ambition, sure, but, underneath that, there was a humility and a human heart .
 It’s all here in these tapes, so enough said.
 Three weeks after these interviews were concluded, Buddy Gardner was found dead in his home, with a needle in his arm.
 Lorelei had disappeared.
 These tapes somehow also disappeared until 1999, when they were found in a stockroom in an abandoned studio in Los Angeles by a technician there who, with some heaven-sent Extra Sensitive Perception, sent them to Camel Jeremy Eros, c/o City Lights Bookstore, where for a while I was taking my mail, while recovering from a broken relationship, one that emasculated me, silenced me, did me up a treat.
 These tapes were a godsend—they took me out of myself, out of the self-pity I was wallowing in.
 Many thanks to John Wender, editor extraordinaire, who recognized what we had here and ran them in his celebrated periodical.
 Hence, they ran first, almost in the form represented here, in three installments in Big City Magazine.

Population: In spite of the continued decline in birth rates, world population is expected to rise by nearly three billion people or 50 per cent over the next three decades, making the task of achieving food security, employment and education for all even more daunting than it is today.
 Poverty: The incidence of poverty continues to increase both in relative and absolute terms.
 Presently, 1.4 billion people, constituting 26 per cent of the total population of developing and developed nations, live in poverty.
 The poorest 20 per cent of the world’s population share a minuscule 1.4 per cent of the world’s income.
 According to current projections, 300 million people, representing nearly 50 per cent of the population of sub-Saharan Africa, will live below the poverty line at the turn of the century.
 Environment: Unsustainable lifestyles and consumption (in industrial countries) and population growth, along with rising levels of production and consumption (in developing countries), will place strenuous demands on the environment of the planet.
 Growing damage to the basic life support systems of soil, water, flora, fauna and the atmosphere is taking place in all parts of the world.
 Unemployment: In the West, rising levels of unemployment have increased resistance to free trade and immigration.
 Rising levels of long-term unemployment and youth unemployment in inner cities are associated with the increasing incidence of crime.
 In developing countries, rapid population growth continues to outpace job creation in most regions, resulting in high levels of unemployment, increasing social unrest and large scale migration from rural to urban areas and internationally.

People think they need to not only have lots of stuff, but to save or invest or buy some insurance so they’ll be sure they’ll always have lots of stuff.
 We need a bit more faith.
 I mean, I don’t have AAA or any kind of roadside service insurance because every time a car of mine has broken down, it’s been a block or so from my mechanic’s house.
 Except one time.
 “The one time my car broke down in an inconvenient place, a guy stopped to help me, and he happened to be the handsomest man I ever saw.
 Maybe he was an angel.
 I don’t know.
 But it sure was fun breaking down.”
 With the time Olga didn’t spend laboring for the sake of acquiring stuff or treating herself to luxuries, along with writing and prayer, she attended gatherings of all kinds where she could meet folks who needed her to teach, or console, or pray with them.
 She chose to live much like Jesus, who passed through the world keeping a lookout for people he could help.

They stood across from each other and readied themselves.
 Both tensed but neither took the low, wide stance previously used.
 As their eyes fixed on one another, I felt myself, and Ruby beside me, lean forward in anticipation of action.
 Both men went taut, their muscles corded, jaws clenched tight, determined stares focusing only on each other.
 I saw nothing happen but knew there must be something, some unseen force causing them pain, draining them.
 I couldn’t look away but stammered to Ruby, “What’s happening?” “They are trying to overpower one another.” I could hear the pleasure in her voice.
 “No silly games, just power.” The way she said it had some part of my mind wondering whether her statement about not having her mother’s ambition was true.
 But I could only concentrate on the struggle in front of me.
 No visible action.
 I tried to judge by appearance who might be winning.

The next instant, we found ourselves surrounded by teachers, coaches, and a platoon of the ROTC.
 While the chatter of several witnesses turned it all into gibberish, and the gatekeeper shouted, “They’ve been drinking,” Kenny stood still, staring at his bloody fist as though wondering how it happened.
 Out of the crowd, a coach came striding.
 He shoved me aside and tried to grab Kenny.
 Kenny bolted, splitting the crowd.
 Down the steps and across the quad, his legs churned faster than the eye could register, like a propeller.
 The previous fall he had broken our school record for the 50-yard dash.
 The coach and a few ROTC kids gave chase.
 They all disappeared into a stand of eucalyptus.
 Most of the teachers and ROTC tailed behind.

 “Come,” she said.
 “We must go north where we are needed most.”
 The two ran through the town, listening for sounds of battle.
 The worst seemed to be about the middle of Celed and steadily working its way south.
 They encountered a few soldiers as they hurried there.
 All died before they had the chance to swing their blades.
 “At last!” Felewen cried, staring out from a side alley.
 They were behind a group of ten soldiers battling a pair of elven warriors who stood back to back.
 “Make haste, they need us!”

2.Coordination of macro-economic policies: The efforts of the industrial nations to achieve higher rates of economic growth and job creation are stymied by the need to maintain macro-economic stability at the same time.
 Due to the competition between OECD members to attract financial resources, rising interest rates or falling inflation rates in one country influence the inflow and outflow of financial resources from other members of the community.
 The efforts to curb inflation at the expense of slower economic growth and job creation need not be so rigorous, if OECD members more closely coordinated their policies to support macro-economic expansion.
 A modest, relatively uniform rise in inflation rates within the OECD would not then result in a significant movement of resources or fluctuation in exchange rates.
 3.Shift investment from defence to education and training: Reduce global defence spending by an additional 50 per cent before the end of the decade to below a maximum threshold of $400 billion.
 Invest at least 10 per cent of the global savings from defence cuts in education and training.
 4.Liberalize agricultural and textile exports: Utilize agriculture as an engine of industrialization, international trade and employment generation by reducing the barriers to a major expansion of agricultural production and exports from and between developing countries.
 More than two billion people in developing countries, representing about 35 per cent of the entire world's population, are dependent on agriculture as a primary source of livelihood.
 This compares with 45 million people in industrial countries, which represents less than 1 per cent of the world's population.
 Agriculture is the most heavily protected sector of world trade.

He didn’t last much longer did he?
 Jim – (shaking his head) No.
 At his baptism.
 Well I thought he was going through with it, he had me convinced.
 I thought he was for real and for true going to join that church.
 Art – That boy could make a fantastic actor one day.
 If he doesn’t wind up in prison.
 Or dead.
 Jim – I think God likes him.
 Which ever God is out there.

Jason, Seth and Emily saw it too because I was chasing after them as we all ran for the few trees ahead.
 In a few seconds I had a complete view of the culprit.
 And strange enough it was a frost beast.
 Frost beasts are the cutest monsters you’ll ever see.
 They’re the size of medium dogs and their pelts are a light, icy blue.
 They may be cute but if you don’t watch out, they could easily be the most dangerous monsters around.
 Don’t let them breath on you, or you’ll freeze to death.
 Literally.
 The frost beast whimpered at me, showing me the cutest eyes imaginable.
 I wanted to melt and hug him but I knew better not to fall victim to its trick.

I attempted every type of magic he could come up with, to no avail.
 I was beyond frustrated.
 Worse, I could tell he was being gentle on purpose, afraid I would break.
 I thought of what he’d said before, the dangers of messing with the bindings.
 He must have read it on my face.
 “That’s enough for now.
 Rest, Freya.” I didn’t argue.
 Ruby came in, as if on cue, and Chevelle excused himself.
 I laid down, but irritation kept me from sleep.
 I returned to the book.

When I set out to write Broken, I never expected that I was going to end up writing the same story from Alec's point of view, but I'm pleased with how both Broken and Torn have turned out, both individually and as a combined work.
 They are done in very different styles, but ultimately that was exactly what I was after.
 I think there is plenty of cross-over of guys reading paranormal romance, and girls picking up more action-packed stories.
 Ultimately I think most of us just want a compelling story, but sometimes the labels that get applied to books get in the way of us discovering them, rather than helping as they are meant to do.
 I think one of the things that made the Harry Potter books so successful was the fact that the whole family could share in the series.
 I remember as Twilight came out thinking that there were plenty of guys who would enjoy Twilight if they ever sat down and read it, but most of them wouldn't ever give it a try.
 My hope with Broken and Torn is that the two stories combine into something that both guys and girls can enjoy.
 The girls are likely to start out with Broken, while guys are likely to pick up Torn and enjoy the extra action there.
 Either way, my biggest hope would be that the guys can introduce their wives and girlfriends to Broken, and the girls can introduce their husbands and boyfriends to Torn.
 We've included excerpts for both Torn and Splintered (the sequel for Broken and Torn) below.

“Ah, well, I suppose just this once.” Grey sat, rough brown boots resting among the stone, and she leaned over him as if for a kiss.
 Her lips stopped just short of his, their eyes connecting as a glint of firelight caught the shimmer and Grey breathed it in.
 As she pulled away, his fingers trailed slowly off her arm and I felt I was intruding, so I averted my eyes.
 Steed, beside me, gave me a gentle smile.
 I like Steed.
 He’s a good guy.
 I shook my head to clear it.
 Cursed dust.
 Ruby joined us.
 “Do the effects last longer sometimes?” I asked.

What’s the difference?
 At some point, at some fulcrum point, I understood.
 Today, Bob Dylan remains a force in my life, though now, he’s also a pal.
 And I can go to him—to his songs--when I am blue, when I am feeling that the world is a place of malefaction and discommoded energy, when I am feeling that there is nothing to be said for the human race, and I can be readjusted.
 How this happens, why this happens, is secondary to the fact that it does.
 I can listen to “Frankie Lee and Judas Priest” or “Visions of Johanna” or “On the Road Again” or “Clothesline Saga” or “Watching the River Flow” and feel that there are angels within humankind.
 I can feel that we are not all lost in the caliginous wastes of our hopelessly chaotic lives.
 Art redeems us.
 This is the seed I’m seeking, the truth I’m trying in my clumsy way to impart.
 Dylan is art, for us anyway, for what we’re talking about.

I said, hey, it’s Buddy.
 I know, she said.
 I said, well, shit, you know, in the restaurant, I’m sorry, I didn’t remember who you were, and I thought, damn, this is embarrassing, but, I thought you were staring at me, you know, to get my attention, to get my heterosexual attention.
 And, well, then I remembered, of course, that I knew you through the Tickles.
 And she said, I wasn’t just looking at you because I expected you to remember me.
 You know, you’re not bad to look at.
 I could have looked all night, she said.
 Well, shit, I thought, ok, yeah.
 I can dig this chick, because I mean, she had this body, well, the kind you dream about.
 And she was this novelist’s daughter and so she was cool and kind of bohemian and had this apartment in Midtown, upper floor, with a nice view of Poplar.

“Aren’t you going to perform the death ceremony?” I worried as the other elves began walking away.
 Anvil spat on the mangled body.
 The corpse.
 “It’s done.” I stood staring at the crumpled mass as the others gathered, arguing.
 A council member.
 “It’s time to move,” someone said.
 Came for me.
 “No, not yet.” Someone else.
 They killed him.
 And I was glad.

In recent years, unemployment has emerged as a major cause of concern for governments around the world.
 In industrial countries, the subject evokes pessimistic prophecies of a fast-approaching future in which tens of millions of people will never find jobs, technology eliminates the need for human labour, cheap imports replace domestic jobs, welfare systems collapse under an unbearable burden, children have less economic opportunity than their parents, a widening abyss divides the rich and poor, and both markets and governments are powerless to do anything about it.
 In developing countries, it dashes hopes of ever conquering hunger, eradicating wide spread rural and urban poverty, and bridging the gap that separates these nations from the prosperous West.
 The very same deterministic mentality that until recently made us feel that a nuclear war was inevitable now leads many to conclude that rising unemployment, chronic poverty and social alienation are unavoidable.
 Yet the enormous gains of peace and democracy that we contemplate cannot be secured and brought to fruition if this other apprehension is allowed to become a settled reality, as war between nations has been during past millennia.
 The peace and security we seek internationally depend directly on our ability to promote and maintain domestic peace and tranquillity within nations, which in turn are dependent on the ability of countries to provide food and economic security to their people.
 Poverty and unemployment are closely linked to most instances of social unrest – tribal wars, civil wars, urban crime, drugs and violence.
 There is clear evidence from the US and UK that crime is economically related to lack of job opportunities.
 Unemployment is also a major cause of massive migrations, both to urban areas within countries and across borders, which has become a highly destabilizing factor in many regions.
 Without sufficient purchasing power for food and other material essentials and non-essentials, there can be no assurances of lasting social peace and political stability.

“Where will we meet you?”
 “Listen for where the screams are at their worst,” Velixar said as his shadow began to fade.
 “There shall I be.”
 A pale hand reached inside his robes and pulled out five glass vials.
 Qurrah knelt and accepted the gifts.
 “The vials contain powerful healing elixirs.
 If either of you are injured tomorrow, drink from them and resume the slaughter anew.”
 “Thank you master,” Harruq said, accepting three from his brother before kneeling as well.
 “We will await you in the chaos,” Qurrah said.
 Then the man was gone, vanishing into the shadows of the room.

I need silence.”
 “What for?” Harruq asked.
 “No,” Qurrah said.
 “Don’t ask when you full well know the answer.”
 At this Harruq nodded.
 Yes, he did know.
 Over the past few months, he had killed seven men and carried their bodies to his brother.
 “I still have at least a week,” Harruq said.
 “Give me until then, alright?
 We could use the money.”

Hour after hour passed in silent misery, until finally the rest of the kids wore themselves out and it quieted down enough for me to lapse into a fitful sleep.
 I was smack-dab in the middle of a dream about Rachel and Britney when everything changed.
 Ever so slowly, the normal dreamscape took on a sharp-edged glow, and then morphed into the breathtaking colors that'd wormed their way even deeper into my heart than I'd realized.
 I didn't recognize my surroundings, but they were different than any of the places I'd been before.
 The new scents whipping past me on the breeze were sign enough even if I hadn't been able to detect the subtle differences in the light emanating off of the foliage paving the trail I was walking along.
 For the length of the dream I lost myself in the wonder of experiencing the world in all of its amazing depth.
 Still, even the pure delight in my surroundings wasn't enough to mute the feeling something was missing.
 Chapter 19 It seemed like the old karmic scale was still going strong and trying very hard to make up for how great Les Misérables had been.
 We finally arrived in town after way too many hours of driving and then I had to wait for Mom to come pick me up.
 The last chaperon had been about five minutes from throwing in the towel and just taking me home herself by the time Mom finally pulled into the school parking lot.

"Don't you remember what we talked about?
 About how-how passionate kissing can lead to lovemaking?"
 "But Rick, can't we kiss at all?"
 He raised her hand to nibble on one delicate fingertip, trying to resist the nearly irresistible impulses that the frustrated desire in her eyes and voice stirred in him.
 "Not like we were tonight.
 Don't you understand, Marie?
 When our kisses get that hot, it's hard for me to stop.
 I don't want to stop.
 I want to make love to you."
 Her face grew fiery, and she was silent for a few seconds, staring down at her hands.

We rode wordlessly on as I chewed over this new knowledge.
 As my watcher, Chevelle would have been involved in the binding by Council.
 Maybe Fannie should have been punished for whatever she had done, but how could they assume I would follow in her footsteps?
 So I’d killed a bird, stolen a few papers from the council library.
 My argument faltered, so I went back to anger, betrayal that he had lied to me.
 And not just him.
 The entire village must have known I was bound, known I couldn’t perform magic, as they sat and watched me try.
 Sending me to Junnie for lessons, allowing Evelyn to taunt me without recourse, giving me the blame for everything that happened.
 Because they expected me to turn.
 The horses slowed to a stop, irritating me further.

Again that greedy look.
 “You are extraordinary.
 I do not have to give you unearned power.
 I must simply guide and instruct.” Velixar stood, and when his power flared, Qurrah fell to his knees and worshipped his new master.
 “You are what I have searched for all these years.
 You and I will destroy this world side by side.
 We will lay waste to all life and put absolute order upon every last soul.”
 “Teach me,” Qurrah said, his mouth buried into the dirt.
 “Show me the power I have sought for so very long.”
 Velixar looked down at his thin, ragged apprentice.

“I guess if that's what you want to do.” Thankfully, there were no trees anywhere except one.
 The ground was mostly dirt and rock, easier to walk on.
 The mountains loomed ahead of us and something tingled down my spine.
 Something was going to happen in those mountains, I just knew.
 The sky was clearer here and also more windy.
 The wind tugged at my hair and clothes as I walked.
 I had to keep squinting to see through my hair.
 I felt a tap on my shoulder and I looked over.
 Emily held her hand out.
 “Here Jazell, use this to keep your hair out of your face,” she opened her hand and dropped something in my palm.

“Well,” Rodregas said, “I think we should just sleep here tonight.
 We can try the house in the morning.
 But I don’t want to disturb the Dire Cats during the night.” They both nodded.
 They had come to the same thought already.
 “Oh,” Rodregas said, “here.” He pulled out one of the extra short swords and its harness from where he had it stashed in the wagon and handed it to Doi’van.
 “If you guys promise not to stab me in the night, it makes sense for you two to be armed.
 Though, I do not think that harness is big enough to fit you without some work.” Rodregas held his last unclaimed short sword up and said, “And here is one for you, Imeralda.” She picked it up, but he could tell she did not know how to handle the weapon.
 Doi’van looked comfortable enough, but the handle was almost too small for his large hand and it looked more like a large dagger in his hand than a sword.
 “You don’t have a bow hidden in that wagon do you?
 I have no idea how to use one of these pig stickers, but I am very good with a bow,” said Imeralda.

The other mothers were threatened by our mother, as she was beautiful and divorced!
 I would later realize how poorly my mother was treated by other mothers, and how she endured many unwanted sexual advances and groping by their spouses and her employers.
 It was the sixties, and my mother was damaged goods in their eyes; she was vulnerable.
 We eventually moved out of my grandparents’ home to an apartment in Los Angeles and then to a small rental house in Burbank that backed up to a military plant.
 Barrels of who-knows-what lined the side of our back fence.
 I guess the rent is cheaper when you live next to a toxic dump!
 We had a yard for our dogs and new friends to meet and we settled into this little house.
 My brother and I still shared a room, as we always had, and we still had each other despite another change in schools and friends.
 At dinner sometimes, Mom wouldn’t eat.
 She would say she wasn’t hungry or offer some excuse.

Doi’van stretched his hands up and up to an impressive height, and a smile spread across his face, the first one Rodregas had seen on the Hellborn face.
 It was good to see, though it was also a little scary as his teeth were more pointed than Rodregas was used to seeing.
 His teeth had more in common with the Dire Cats than himself or Imeralda.
 “Of course, I know this first hand as it is the same for us Hellborn.
 We will not grow strong if we do not spend much of our childhood in a place that is rich in magic.
 This place feels very good.
 The last few years the only time I was in a place rich in magic, I was also a prisoner.
 It is good not to hunger for magic and be FREE!” Rodregas was, of course, curious about the Hellborn’s background but had been hesitant to ask.
 You do not want to piss off one of the Hellborn.
 Hellborn were not necessarily chaotic and sadistic beings, like actual daemons or Greater Daemons, at least unless they voluntarily chose to become one of Hell’s Chosen.

But if he were to try to incorporate a thousand ants, he would only gain the same connection as that single ant.
 So instead he might try a butterfly to gain the power of its greater life essence.” At this point Jordaan paused and he went from an expression of lecturing to one of fearfulness.
 Rodregas almost expected him to look around for an assassin.
 When next he spoke, his words were quiet and drawn out.
 “The Gods and Infernals have been at war from the beginning of time.
 They are opposites of the eternal balance of creation and destruction.
 But when mortals started to combine the various powers, the two eternal enemies agreed on one thing and this became ‘The One Law.’” “Mortals can work to become Gods through growing in Celestial Power, and they can even tap into the elemental powers.
 They also can become Infernals if they so wish, though I know of few who have tried.
 The chaotic and destructive nature of the infernal does not lead to the necessary discipline that is required to be an Immortalist.
 A mortal must choose only one path; Celestial or Infernal.

It’s an understatement to say all hell broke loose.
 In my opinion, it was way crazier than that.
 Kojas sidestepped my arrow and it disappeared somewhere in the trees.
 Emily raised her hands and roots twisted upward, trying to encase Kojas but he kept slashing them away.
 Jason attempted to distract him by running around throwing knives at him but I think Jason was too busy ducking the black stuff that shot out of Kojas’ hands.
 I ran right past all of them and towards Seth.
 I knelt down and smacked him across his good cheek.
 “Ow, what was that for?” he grunted.
 “I don’t have enough bruises for your liking?” “That’s for being a jerk and not telling us you were going to fight Kojas on your own,” I said angrily.
 “Hey in my defense, he found me first.” I opened my mouth to say something smart, but I hear Emily scream.

My head screamed.
 The sound of metal bands snapping echoed through a scraping, screeching noise inside my head.
 I pressed my palms against my temples.
 I didn’t know I was going down until my knees hit the hard rock.
 I held myself there, refusing to give in.
 They argued frantically.
 “Knock her out.
 Do something.
 She’s going to crack.” Yes, crack.
 That was a good word for it.

While the Commission’s report anticipated the importance of the information superhighway even before the World Wide Web radically transformed global communications, information exchange and commerce, ICPF did not foresee the dramatic impact that the Internet would have on the future export of service jobs to developing countries.
 The West has been exporting manufacturing jobs in large numbers for half a century, fuelling the growth of Japan, the East Asia tigers, and more recently China; but until the emergence of the information superhighway, the scope for export of service jobs was limited.
 Technological development has changed that.
 As a result, business process outsourcing has become one of the fastest growing sectors of the world economy.
 As growth of the labour force slows in high-income countries, there will be increasing pressure for export of service jobs.
 Public concern in the West over the rapid growth of outsourcing is fuelled by the common misconception that employment is a zero sum game.
 A recent authoritative study of the impact of IT outsourcing found that the direct gains to the US economy in the form of additional jobs in other fields, higher real wages, higher real GDP growth, contained inflation and expanded exports far outweigh the losses.
 While global IT software and service outsourcing displaces some IT workers, total employment increases as the benefits ripple through the economy.
 The net additional number of jobs in the USA added as a result of outsourcing is projected to exceed 300,000 by 2008.
 They will be generated across all sectors of the economy, most especially in construction, transportation and utilities, education and health services, wholesale trade, and financial services.

Of course it was black.
 I couldn't imagine Vincent in anything other than a black vehicle.
 Predictably, Vincent was rubbing down his vehicle, but the exercise seemed more targeted to giving him a chance to walk around with his shirt off than it did with cleaning up the already immaculate truck.
 Based on the way the cheerleader types by the garage were watching him, it was working.
 I much preferred Brandon's jeans and tee shirt, tight as it was, over the shorts and shirtless look, but apparently I was in the minority.
 I almost hyperventilated when Vincent casually walked out of the house with a pair of beer kegs and tied them down in the bed of his pickup.
 His house was more on the fringes of town, but it was still in town.
 What if his parents came home and saw them?
 For that matter, where had he been hiding them?
 It wasn't even remotely possible that all of the people who were going to be at the party were old enough to drink without getting arrested.

In many countries, the problem of hunger has less to do with insufficient food production than with distribution or entitlement.
 The poor lack remunerative employment opportunities to generate the purchasing power needed to obtain the minimum essential requirements of food.
 In 1990, the Commission undertook a study of alternative strategies to eradicate poverty among the 300 million extremely poor in India, representing about 25 per cent of the poor worldwide, by more extensive development of commercial agriculture and agro-based industries.
 Following ICPF's third plenary meeting in Madras in October 1991, ICPF's Prosperity 2000 plan for creating 100 million jobs in India was presented to the Indian government, which incorporated the strategy in its Eighth Five Year Plan.
 The findings of that study and the strategic recommendations that emerged from it convinced us that eradicating the spectres of hunger, unemployment and poverty was possible even though these problems are present on such a massive scale in many developing countries.
 Events continued to accelerate with the break-up of the USSR later that year, followed by the collapse of the Eastern European economies in 1992.
 Simultaneously, the slowdown in trade within this region and the high cost of Germany's reunification were having an unexpected and unwelcome impact on economic recovery in the industrial countries.
 Reduced military spending, large budget deficits and declining imports from Eastern Europe slowed growth and aggravated the already acute problem of unemployment in Europe and North America.
 Rising anxiety over prospects for employment in the 1990s posed a serious threat to global trade negotiations and to the prospects for growth in the developing world.
 Examination of the rising problem of unemployment in industrial nations led us to the formulation of a comprehensive strategy for full employment in the West.

Yes."
 He followed her outside.
 "When you think you've gone far enough, yell.
 If you're lost, I'll find you."
 She nodded and started to turn to go into the garden.
 But Rick caught her hand, stopping her.
 He gazed down at her.
 "I hope you get back, Marie.
 But if you do, I'll miss you."
 Her throat was suddenly sore.

"Then don't leave me."
 She looked up at him, her eyes filling with tears.
 "I have to.
 I-I just have to.
 I have to go home."
 They stayed locked in each other's arms, her tears soaking into his shirt, his tears dripping into her hair.
 At last, Rick, feeling weak and shaky, took Marie's hand and led her to the living room.
 They sat down on the sofa, and he drew her close.
 "I love you more than anything in the world," he whispered into her hair.
 "I love you too.

We killed her.” It sounded so matter-of-fact, my head bobbing along with the words.
 I couldn’t seem to stop.
 My mouth opened to speak once more but I was suddenly swept up, off Steed’s lap and into Chevelle’s arms.
 I managed fear for half a second but then lost the feeling to dizziness, followed quickly by only dull numbness.
 Chevelle was laying me on my bed.
 “Stay here.
 It will pass.” His words were gentle now, the anger gone.
 “I’m sorry,” I whispered.
 He didn’t respond.
 He leaned over me to straighten the bedding, his face close to mine.

The wall came at me again.
 “Okay, okay,” I shouted.
 “Let me up.” Chevelle’s camouflage dissipated and he stared down at me, disappointed.
 I smirked.
 “Where’s your horse?” He smiled as the beast nipped at the back of my head, yanking my hair.
 Grumbling, I swatted the horse away and ran my hand over my face, sure it was mottled with bruises and scratch marks.
 “Drink this.” Chevelle offered me a hide flagon and I took it, swallowing a mouthful before the taste hit me.
 “Gah, that tastes like cat pee smells.” Chevelle chuckled.
 “It will help with the healing.” Why bother?
 I wondered.

“What was that?”
 He kicked a rock.
 “It’s better to spar with another, remember?”
 Aurelia frowned.
 “You know I am a sorceress.
 My time should be spent studying my craft.
 I only wanted to be proficient with my staff, not a master.”
 A tiny bit of panic crept into Harruq’s voice.
 “Yeah, but, but, it’s only an hour or two, and who said you were proficient anyway?
 I could beat you without trying, and so could anyone better than me.

The world would be better for his absence.
 I could hear the other pack now, panting with exertion, our friends hot on their heels.
 Vincent overreached in his effort to claim the kill, and I sunk my teeth into the muscled flesh of his shoulder as I finally made it around behind him.
 My claws sank into his arms and legs as I repositioned to snap his neck, and then a hammer blow of weight struck me across the shoulders.
 Knocked loose from Vincent, I spun around in time to tear Simon from the air as he leaped at me again.
 It was the perfect opportunity to end a life nearly as evil as Vincent's, but one of the recent arrivals had bowled Jasmin over.
 Leveraging a frame that was more than capable of picking up a small car, I threw Simon into the whirling ball of flesh and fangs.
 He didn't hit hard enough to snap his neck, but he knocked the other wolf off of Jasmin, and then Vincent was back on his feet.
 The rest of the rival pack, save for Brandon their leader, came streaming past, but they didn't help their fellows swarm Jasmin and me over.
 None of them even slowed.

"When I'm missing my family, thinking about seeing them again and thinking how ecstatic they'll be is the only thing that keeps me from complete despair."
 She opened the hand clenching the diamond and held it out to him.
 "I'm sorry, Rick.
 I love you, but I can't marry you."
 Reluctantly he took the ring, pocketing it as he watched her rise and head for the bathroom.
 She didn't know what he did—that she could go home tomorrow.
 She'd calm down, and then things would go back to normal.
 Eventually she'd accept that her life was here now.
 She'd have to accept it.

People in those northern states drink beer, watch obsessive amounts of hockey and say Eh.
 All three of those states border Canada.
 Those states have obviously been slowly taken over by advanced Canadian forces.
 Johnny – I suppose that all the famous movie stars born in Canada are really advance scouts for the rest of the army then.
 Spreading their evil propaganda and brain-washing the masses hmmmm?
 Jim – Damn strait, those Canadians are sneaky bastards.
 They spread like a virus, but they do it slowly so nobody notices.
 But I’m on to them.
 They won’t get away with this!
 Liz – Bwa ha ha ha!

“What are you doing?” It would have been a yell it if wasn’t hissed.
 The tone was harsh and I recognized it at once.
 “Oh,” I managed.
 Part of me was saying calm down, but the other was screaming I was still in danger.
 “Chevelle… I…” I didn’t have an answer.
 What was I doing?
 He released his grip just a fraction.
 “I went to your room and you were gone.” He shook his head.
 “I thought I had to come out here to get a search party.” “I, uh… you were in my room?” He straightened, his expression making it clear he hadn’t expected that response.
 I pressed, taking the chance.

Then we stepped out into the sunlight.
 While I gave them the news, Cliff kicked gravel with both feet.
 Billy stared at the sky.
 His chin trembled.
 A college boy guarded the parking lot.
 We had to get a note from the office before he would unlock the gate and let us out.
 My gas gauge read empty, and between us we hadn’t enough change to finance the trip to the hospital, which was almost to the mountains, a dozen miles or more.
 So we drove to Cliff and Billy’s house to bum gas money.
 Their mom, Evelyn, called the hospital and learned that Eric was in the operating room, and that no visitors could see him that day.
 She tried to feed and comfort us.

Its skin and mane were sparkling white.
 Dieredon bowed one last time and then leapt into the air, using the ledge of a window to swing himself onto the roof.
 He mounted his horse, patted her side, and then took off into the night.
 “Damn it all!” Antonil shouted, slamming his mailed fist into the wall.
 Still shaking his head, he stormed back to the gate, muttering curses.
 “What was that all about?” Harruq asked.
 “King Vaelor asked for aid and the elves declined,” Qurrah answered, chuckling.
 “The King’s pride will not take too kindly to that.”
 “He and his pride can suck a rotten egg,” Harruq said.
 “Hurry or we’ll miss the battle.”

I examined the shelves in front of me, looking for a match to the symbols, and found the sections to be arranged by groups, each shelf divided by categories within.
 I walked the library in search of the section marked for either of the characters listed on my documents, and was about to give up when I noticed some encased racks in the center of the room.
 I checked the small section, seeing immediately the symbols fit.
 I smiled, thinking how easy it had been as I slid my fingertips across the volumes on that shelf.
 My fingers tingled as they crossed a thin section of pages bound together.
 I slid them out just as I became aware of some sort of commotion… that sounded like it was getting closer.
 No, not a tingle indicating what I was looking for.
 It was a protection spell.
 I ran.
 As I shot through the rooms, all I could think of was not getting caught.

When the snore rang clearly through the house, I breathed a sigh of relief.
 We threw on our sneakers and snuck out the door.
 The summer night air was cool but a little sticky and clammy, making our bodies feel damp.
 I followed Emily down to the back of the garage, where we sat down and entered the monsters’ world.
 I pushed my green hair back and hid behind a tree beside Emily to watch the dwarfs.
 There must have been more than ten of them gathered together.
 They were parading around a blazing camp fire, mumbling and talking about things I couldn’t hear over the flames.
 Some more emerged from the woods and joined them, their shadows dancing behind them.
 Then all of them suddenly broke out into an ominous song: “He will rise to the heavens, from the very pits of hell.
 To take control of our world, and the gift- less ones as well.

“We need to hurry, though.”
 He looped his arm through Qurrah’s and then hurried down the alley.
 As a soldier’s body collapsed at the end, the two stopped, and Harruq swore.
 “The orcs made it through,” he said, to which Qurrah nodded.
 “This could be bad.”
 An orc stepped into the alley, blood splashed across his gray skin.
 He held a sword in each hand, dripping gore coating both.
 Shouting something in a guttural language neither understood, the orc charged.
 “Get back,” Harruq ordered as he shoved Qurrah to one side.
 He slammed himself against a house, barely dodging a downward chop of the blades.

I’ll be here alone, except for Rune.
 He’s to continue my practice.
 Chevelle approached during his pacing and I slid the book into my pack, pretending to examine the beading on the material of the dress.
 This seemed to disturb him.
 He avoided pacing near me the rest of the evening, throwing me odd glances now and again.
 I shrugged it off and went back to reading.
 Father has been gone for weeks.
 Rumor is he’s searching for a new mate.
 Someone unique, someone powerful, I’m sure.
 I can’t stand it anymore.

_Hands of ice_.
 The half-orc lunged forward, grabbing the old man by the wrist.
 Blue light swirled around the contact of their flesh, causing the water and blood inside his arm to freeze.
 Qurrah’s smile broadened as the man collapsed and died while still within his grasp.
 When he let go, the icy flesh hit the dirt hard enough to crack the arm at the shoulder.
 Blood poured out from the body but not the arm.
 “A marvelous spell,” the half-orc gasped, fighting away a momentary wave of dizziness.
 He closed his eyes and attuned his mind to the village.
 A stench of fear trailed west.
 Women and children, all of them panicked and confused.

The problem can only be banished by an all-out commitment of every national government to eliminate the huge backlog of illiteracy, while at the same time insuring that every child is taught to read and write.
 National youth service corps and military personnel can be utilized to help provide the necessary manpower.
 Second, every possible step must be taken to provide education for female children, an essential requirement for social equity and quality of life improvement.
 Nearly two-thirds of the world’s illiterate are women.
 In the poorest developing countries, literacy rates among females are 40 per cent below rates for males and the average number of years of schooling for females is 60 per cent lower.
 But perceptible progress has been made.
 Between 1980 and 1990, female primary school enrolment rose from 44 per cent to 47 per cent of total enrolment, although it actually declined in the Arab states and remained virtually unchanged in South Asia.
 Uneducated females represent a huge reservoir of untapped human potential that must be given every opportunity and full assistance to develop their innate capacities.
 This will call for accelerated efforts to establish crèche and child-care facilities, abolish child labour, and remove gender bias from text books and educational institutions.
 The cost of raising female educational levels up to that of males worldwide has been estimated at $2.5 billion, a small amount for an initiative that could have such wide-ranging benefits.

Davis thought they were a waste of time.
 Marie climbed into bed with a frown.
 She and Davis were going to have to have a serious discussion.
 She didn't intend to have a husband whom she saw only at meals and at bedtime.
 CHAPTER SIX
 Marie awoke at dawn the next morning and jumped into her clothes.
 She was halfway down the stairs when she remembered she'd promised Rick that she'd wake him up so that he could stay within earshot of her.
 "Rick," she called, tapping on his door.
 "Rick."
 "Just a minute."

Lisa stood there pale and exhausted, frightened like the night of his intervention.
 As I remember it, she resembled my mother, so many years before, when we visited Thomas in prison.
 Lisa could not add even a word.
 Brandon left our home with little in his hands and got into what was once a nice little car, but was now something appropriate for a salvage yard with body damage, a driver’s door that wouldn’t open, and water leaking through missing door seals.
 Brandon had to get in from the passenger side of this wreck of a car, symbolic of his wreck of a life.
 My wife and I held each other as we watched him back out of the driveway.
 He couldn’t even look at us as he drove away to God knows where.
 We were numb.
 Our son was 6’2” about 135 pounds and addicted to one of the most powerful drugs on the street: Oxycontin.
 What would happen to him?

Any attempts at tracking his passage would be utterly futile, for not a single blade of grass remained bent when his foot stepped away.
 He was Dieredon, Scoutmaster of the Quellan elves, and few souls could match his silence, speed, or skills with blade and bow.
 When the village came into view of his eagle-like eyes, his gut sank.
 Not a single sign of life decorated the streets or moved in the fields.
 He prayed to Celestia he was wrong, but his heart knew he wasn’t.
 He found nothing to convince him otherwise as he quickly scanned the village.
 He found many homes left wide open, yet none answered him when he called inside.
 Everywhere, staining the earth a dark crimson, there was blood.
 “It is as I feared,” he whispered to the night.
 He stood, took his bow off his shoulder, and then thoroughly searched the town.

 “Alvrik,” Harruq muttered as he approached the giant double doors leading into the castle, which were flanked on each side by two soldiers.
 “Avrik?
 Alrik?
 Avlerik?
 How the bloody abyss did he say his name?”
 He stopped when he realized the soldiers were staring at him with none-too- happy looks on their faces.
 “Oh, hello,” he said, doing his best to smile.
 “I was looking for, er, Alvrik.
 He was just in the center of town, and…”

Jill was nineteen.
 One Friday evening, she hosted a party.
 I drank several beers, then invited somebody who reminded me of Karen Flagstad to join me for a cruise up the coast road to La Jolla.
 Her name was Kris.
 She would go with me, she said, if not for a babysitting job she had that night.
 After she left, I drank more beer.
 Then I drove to a Jack in the Box on the coast road and found Kris there, in a Ford, hanging onto my cousin Jill’s boyfriend, Jimmy Dixon.
 Jimmy was one tough fellow.
 According to rumor, while fighting in the Golden Glove tournament, he had knocked another light-heavyweight into a coma.
 An equally tough surfer, Butch Van Artsdalen, rode shotgun.

Some still pass it by and cross themselves, hearken back to the days of divination, the days when music could save a dying nation, a nation bent on its own self-immolation.
 That was the sixties.
 Even in Memphis, an outpost planet.
 A tributary, if you will.
 That first session, so it is told, was as if energy itself had been created in that concrete empty shell, where grass pushed through the floor, straining to catch these new vibes, this new electrical Jubal.
 Buddy cut loose as if he had been formerly playing in a straightjacket.
 And Skippy and Crafty—later re-christened Castor and Pollux—created a bottom like a sheol torture chamber, like Thor and Loki at war.
 The crash and thunder coming out of that old Sinclair station was music from the beginning of time, the music the apes heard which made them men.
 Music, soul-deep.
 Collective unconscious-deep.

 Jim – …I only did that once, and I have been watching for those conditions ever since.
 Liz – Too bad you weren’t paying attention the first time it happened.
 But let’s keep moving.
 Jim – Well, I love the two, of first, Jesus shaking hands with Elvis, and then of them fighting a gaggle of ninjas.
 It isn’t about your parents is it?
 I just thought it was about Jesus and Elvis fighting ninjas.

“How could you Jazell?
 You could have gotten seriously hurt.
 Plus I bet all of us want a shot at them too.” She huffed and shook her head.
 The light brown curls that framed her pretty face bounced around playfully.
 “I’m fine Emily, seriously.” Jason was silent.
 He never talked much like Emily, who was easily the most talkative, friendly person I knew.
 Jason was more of the silent, watching type, who said little but noticed much.
 I traced in a puddle on the table, avoiding everyone’s eye contact as they stared at me.
 Emily patted my arm.
 “It’s okay.

"Do what?"
 "Those motorcycles.

 "They're jet skis.

 She watched as the actors climbed towers, rode hand trolleys on cables, jumped from shattered platforms into the water.
 And when the heroine shot the villain, causing his jacket to catch on fire, Marie screamed.
 It was so real, and she gripped the edge of her seat as she waited to see what would happen after he fell into the water.
 The villain jumped up on the platform to make his bows with the rest of the cast.
 Marie raised wide eyes to Rick's face as they stood to leave.

We went down to the nurse’s station and said, room 1324 checking out.
 (laughs)  It’s funny now.
 But, then, it was like we were doing something extraordinary and perhaps not entirely wholesome.
 We drove home in compete silence.
 And when we got home, we undressed as if it were all scripted, as if this was the end of that chapter.
 And when we were both naked, we fell together into the bed.
 And we fucked and cried and cried and fucked and it was all ok.
 If only for a little while.
 It was shortly after this that I left Memphis for good.

This analysis is likely to identify a wide gap between present and potential achievements, which can form the basis for creating an alternative district development plan.
 Government can seek the assistance of farmers' organizations, private enter prise, educational and research institutes, and voluntary agencies for gathering information, analysis and plan formulation.
 Implementation of the plan should be primarily through activities that facilitate more efficient operation of market forces, such as assisting farmers to identify and transfer improved technology, establishing commercial organizations of small farmers and linkages between farms and industry, disseminating in formation on markets and technology, demonstration, education, training and incentives to stimulate rapid multiplication.
 The UN development force can undertake to assist countries in the design and implementation of model district programmes in food deficit countries, and to transfer the expertise needed for replication in other parts of each country.
 5.World food model.
 The actual structure and dynamics of the development of global agriculture and its relationship to industrial ization, employment and trade needs to be fully understood in order to plan for, and achieve, a world free of hunger.
 Although national and international institutions maintain a variety of data bases and models to track the impact of production, trade and prices in agriculture, these models are too limited in scope and detail to construct a working global model of the agricultural sector, which could serve as a valuable tool in projecting the medium- and long-term interactions of changes in food production, consumption, employment, trade, productivity, technology and environmental factors.
 A world food model, which forms the essential basis for evolving a global strategic plan, can help eliminate both food deficits and surpluses.
 6.On-farm training.
 The massive demonstration programmes, conducted in farmers' own fields by countries such as India to propagate the Green Revolution technology, proved that even uneducated, traditional peasant farmers in developing countries will rush to adopt new technology when its application and benefits are clearly demonstrated.

He had learned he didn’t need “things” to prove anything to anybody.
 His ex-girlfriend, Tiffanie, met us at the storage unit to claim her belongings.
 She looked about twenty pounds heavier and it was good weight.
 Tiffanie had been clean and sober since her last relapse in the rehab center.
 They smiled at each other and commented on their vast physical changes.
 They knew their life as a couple was over and that they had both gone their separate ways, while both going in the same positive direction—off drugs—despite astronomical odds.
 The conversation they had was all about sobriety and how wonderful it was to be clean.
 They both had big smiles and clear eyes and they looked like a couple of healthy young people, and that is exactly what they were.
 I also took the opportunity to arrange a meeting at a Starbucks, a reunion of sorts.
 I had stayed in contact with Officer White by e-mailing him updates on Brandon’s progress as a courtesy to him and as a bit of a reward.

“Then it is a false kindness,” Dieredon said.
 He paused for a moment, grabbed his chest with his healthy arm, and then looked at her again.
 Pain was evident in his eyes.
 “That man has an army of undead.
 I barely managed to hide until daylight.
 Woodhaven is in danger, and so are you.”
 Aurelia stepped back, frowning.
 “Are you sure it was Harruq?”

Mickey Mouse hadn't been around in 1927, and she found the whole idea of a fantasy land for children exciting.
 And she loved Splash Mountain.
 "Are you sad to be leaving?"
 Rick asked that evening as he watched her pack.
 "Yes.
 This has been a dream-come-true, and I'd like to stay in the dream."
 With a sigh she folded her baja and put it in her suitcase.
 He stood, placing his hands on her shoulders from behind.
 "If we get a chance, we'll come back."
 She turned around, gazing up at him anxiously.

Greg: I was going to wear some makeup.
 Cindy:  it’s both, it’s a fantastic adrenaline rush, the bull and the crowds all watching you, it’s like being an action hero or a firefighter or something.
 Greg:  But I couldn’t find a lipstick that matches my complexion.
 Cindy:  really, what do you do?
 Greg:  Actually I did find a lipstick that matches my complexion, I just didn’t want to go that far yet.
 Cindy:  Really?
 Have you ever met him?
 Greg:  How do you stand to wear these clothes?
 Cindy:  the great one himself, Ronald McDonald!
 He is an inspiration to clowns everywhere.

Eric didn’t need absence slips.
 If he returned to school after an absence and told the attendance clerk he’d been out with the one-day variety of bubonic plague, she would have excused him rather than phone his mother to verify.
 When anyone from the school called Sylvia, she might hold the person on the phone for an hour, ranting about their misdeeds.
 I have two pictures of Eric.
 His senior picture, given a full page in our senior-year annual, a head shot of keen blue eyes with thick lashes, freckles, and sandy hair, a chin square as Dick Tracy’s, an easy grin that would have wrongly convinced you he was loaded with confidence.
 And the one Sylvia called the “Jesus body picture” a snapshot somebody took in the locker room.
 Eric in a jock strap, beaming, his legs and arms spread as though to greet a familiar angel.
 Eric was superman.
 Strong, handsome, understanding, considerate, creative, vital, and brilliant.
 It was Eric who brought home Bertrand Russell’s Why I Am Not a Christian.

The wind whipped at my hair, causing me to see the green strands in front of my eyes.
 The cold nipped at my cheeks and nose, which I tried to rub back to warmth.
 I stood at the edge of the cliff and gasped when I looked down.
 Underneath me, hundreds of monsters gathered around a fight.
 I couldn’t see who was fighting inside because a swamp troll blocked my view, but I knew it was brutal the way they whooped at a screech of pain.
 I wanted to close my eyes and look away, but I was so curious to see what was going on, that I couldn’t.
 The crowd parted to reveal the scariest and most hideous thing I’ve ever seen.
 It must have been some type of faery because I could see long, pointed ears sticking up from the sides of its head.
 Long, black hair was stuck out in all directions on top of its head looking slimy and dirty.
 Sharp, twisted horns sat on top of its head, gleaming in the dark.

He wanted to spill the story, but he did not really trust these men.
 He had spent hard years on the road and knew not to trust people that you have just met.
 You especially do not trust people who try to kill you while you sleep.
 And as long as people thought he might be Ravenhurr, maybe a little crazy from a spell gone wrong or something, the less likely the Guild of the Celestial Path would send the Immortal Guards against him.
 So Rodregas said, “Let’s just say I am trying to figure out who I am.
 You can call me…,” he thought for a minute, making it obvious he was making up a fake name.
 He did not want to use his real name.
 He thought to himself, “Who do I want to be?” “If I’m going to try to fight against the Immortalists, then some sort of name fit for a Celestial Paladin, or maybe one fit for an Infernal adversary was needed,” he thought with a smile.
 The only way he could have survived the ceremony would have been divine intervention, so he said the first thing that came to mind, “You can call me Sir Paladin, that will work for now,” he said it with a smile and a slight snicker at his own joke.
 “Just what kind of Paladin would you be?” Imeralda asked him.

How could he say he loved her and deliberately keep her here against her will?
 How could he put his wants above hers?
 Standing up, he raked his fingers through his hair.
 Marie looked up at him with concern.
 "Are you all right?"
 "No."
 He closed his eyes.
 "What would you say if I told you you could go home tomorrow?"
 "I'd jump for joy.
 Why?"

"When you think you've gone far enough, yell.
 If you're lost, I'll find you."
 She nodded and started to turn to go into the garden.
 But Rick caught her hand, stopping her.
 He gazed down at her.
 "I hope you get back, Marie.
 But if you do, I'll miss you."
 Her throat was suddenly sore.
 "I-I think you have some lint on your back."
 She embraced him, whispering, "Thank you for everything.

"I like your kisses."
 "I like yours too."
 He pressed his lips to hers.
 Marie nestled close to him, hoping he'd kiss her like he had last time.
 But then she hiccupped.
 Rick, startled, pulled back.
 "I've never kissed a girl with the hiccups before," he said, chuckling.
 "I'm sorry."
 She turned red and hiccupped again.
 He laughed.

Currently, there are nearly one billion self-employed and unpaid family workers in the world, most of them self-employed farmers in developing countries.
 The self-employed represent 48 per cent of the workforce in low-income economies (less than $500 per capita GDP).
 For any strategy to be successful, it must give central importance to self-employment and entrepreneurship, with emphasis on agriculture, agro-industry and small firms in the informal sector.
 While a single approach will not be applicable to countries and regions of the world in different stages of development, a number of common principles and strategies are widely applicable.
 Agriculture as an engine
 Slightly more than half the world’s workforce, of whom 30 per cent are women, are still engaged in agriculture.
 Agriculture will remain the largest single occupation for the foreseeable future.
 For too long this sector has been regarded by planners primarily as the source of essential food production.
 Historically, agriculture has also played a major role as an engine for economic growth and employment.
 The Industrial Revolution in nineteenth-century England was spawned by rising productivity and incomes in agriculture that increased demand for manufactured goods.

Unlike you, I can actually think for myself.
 I don't know what kind of sick hold Alec has over you, but until you do something about it, you'll never have any real friends.
 He won't ever let you have one."
 She wiped away a pair of tears before they could escape from the corner of her eyes.
 "You don't know what you're talking about, Adri.
 You really can't trust Brandon.
 He's not safe."
 "Whatever.
 Like your brother is any better."
 I turned and went out through the exterior door.

Liz – You’re making this up aren’t you.
 You’re just messing with me, very funny Jimbo, very funny.
 Saying those kind of things about your own mother.
 Its wrong…
 Jim – Do you remember Johnny’s tenth birthday where he got all the presents and stuff?
 That mound of gifts, and the huge party?
 Liz – Of course, I was sooooo jealous, my parents haven’t ever done that sort of thing for me…
 Jim - Well the party was paid for out of Johnny’s college savings account.
 He kind of made a nuisance of himself to get a party, so she made him spend his money to pay for it.
 Liz – That must have cost a fortune, did he have to pay for the gifts too?

The only answer I receive is a maybe.
 But all I need is to recognize the long shot possibility that the dearest person I have known gave his life for me and, despite the sorrow, my heart leaps with adoration.
 For a moment on Highway 101 in Pismo Beach, I feel sure that Eric was Jesus.
 Not in full, as in a Second Coming.
 But in a way so that Jesus entered him and took possession.
 While this thought grips me, both Eric and Jesus become so precious the word adore feels timid and weak.
 Cliff and Toni
 A semi cuts in front of me while we climb Cuesta grade, just north of San Luis Obispo.
 Surrounded by semis, I decide I had better return to the mundane world.
 The last dozen miles to Cliff’s home in Atascadero I spend wondering if I could possibly write something that might introduce Cliff, Billy, and Bob to God.

“We will not,” Qurrah said.
 “How will I know where this Ahrqur lives?”
 “I will show you, my disciple, but first I have a gift for my dearest bone general.”
 Velixar drew out his magical chest.
 He set it beside him and let it grow out to normal size.
 From within he pulled out a suit of armor stained a deep shade of black.
 He threw it to Harruq, who managed to catch it even though his mouth hung wide open.
 “The first Horde War was caused by a disciple of mine,” the man in black explained.
 “He blessed the armor of one of the leaders of the orcish clans.
 I claimed it when he fell on the battlefield.”

"It's safe; there's no trace of them."
 He held the door open for me, and then slipped outside.
 "You need to erase any evidence that you weren't here all night.
 Take a shower, change into some of your own clothes, and then go to sleep.
 We'll keep watch outside until your mom gets back."
 I opened my mouth to ask what would happen after that, but he was already gone, moving so quickly through the darkness that I wasn't even sure which direction he'd headed.
 I locked the door for the first time since we'd arrived in Sanctuary, turned on all the downstairs lights, and then slowly walked upstairs.
 It was crazy to be scared that Alec had somehow missed someone, but I couldn't shake the feeling I was being watched.
 Once I finally made it upstairs, I checked both rooms, and the bathroom, before finally relaxing a little.
 I showered quickly, carefully making sure the smell of alcohol and cigarette smoke was out of my hair, and then changed into clean clothes and collapsed onto my bed.

"Well, sort of.
 The programs aren't like movies--well, some of them are.
 Most programs are shorter--half an hour or an hour."
 He went to get the TV guide and found the listing for Saturday evening.
 A western had come on at 9:00.
 That would be a good place to begin, since it was set before 1927.
 "I think you'll like this western," he told her, turning on the TV with the remote.
 She stared at the little box in his hand.
 "Did that box make the picture appear?"
 "Yeah."

You remind me so much of your father.
 So serious and worried all the time.
 Oh, how I miss him."
 Alec let his mother take both of his hands in hers.
 "I know you do, Mother.
 Rachel and I miss him too."
 Alec's mom tossed her head.
 "You barely remember him.
 Rachel's a good girl, but she was so young when he died.
 She can't really miss him.

I didn’t share her enthusiasm, so I retired to my room and read more of the journal.
 There were many sad passages after the passing of the writer’s mother, though their bond didn’t seem traditional.
 It seemed more… formal.
 And there were many complaints about the additional workload, both with the castle duties—which were described in more detail—and her training.
 I couldn’t be sure how much time had passed without the entries being dated, but her mood had definitely shifted.
 Father has been merciless in my practice and testing with Rune.
 Unrelenting sessions are wearing on me.
 I can barely concentrate.
 I don’t have the energy for the simplest tasks, let alone the new and wild trials he’s created.
 He thinks he has to test every possible idea he has or else he won’t know what I might be capable of.

She shrank back, fearful again.
 "No."
 "It's the only way you'll believe me.
 Do you know what a television is?
 A blender?
 A microwave?"
 When her eyes grew larger with fear, he knelt beside her.
 "I won't hurt you, Marie.
 You don't know how to get back home, anyway.
 Just trust me a little."

In fact, he and his partner asked me if I had done this before because I was so stern with her and refused to bend.
 I guess they were accustomed to dealing with strung out drug addicts.
 I was still completely disappointed and I told them so.
 I just wanted this over and I had every expectation that it would be finished tonight and I could get on with my life and my son could get on with rehab and hopefully get healthy.
 Once I was un-wired I was able to call my wife who was a sobbing mess.
 Not hearing from me and the uncertainty of the night had taken its toll on her and my son.
 I headed home defeated and unsure if I would ever get the opportunity to complete the task that would free my son from a three to five year prison term.
 I was mentally exhausted and I didn’t know what my next move would be.
 All I knew is that the officers told me that if Ashley contacted me, I was to put her off until next week because they couldn’t put a crew together until the following Tuesday.
 Not only did I need to put humpty dumpty (the drug deal) back together again, I had to do it on a specific day at a specific time and in a county that the dealers clearly didn’t want anything to do with.

The gash of white cutting across his darkly tanned skin was uncomfortably similar to what I imagined his wound must have looked like just after Brandon had inflicted it.
 He sighed, but there wasn't any real frustration to the sound.
 "Our cases are hardly comparable.
 You know I heal more quickly than you do."
 An upraised finger cut me off before I could latch onto my last remaining point.
 "The fact that your injury was less severe is really quite immaterial.
 Even the fact that shape shifter-inflicted wounds don't heal as quickly as normal for me is really a small matter when compared to just how much blood you lost before we got the bleeding staunched."
 And there was the real rub.
 Alec was well on his way to being fully healed, while I still had fits of dizziness every time I tried to stand.
 I even had to have Jasmin or Dom help me to the bathroom.

When we came through the pass our path widened, but the horses didn’t separate as I had expected them to.
 I decided I’d had enough of that.
 “How do I control Steed?” I could see the humor in his eyes at my phrasing, but he kept a straight face.
 “Think of where you want him to go and lead his head so.” I concentrated on turning left and we were instantly spinning, the unexpected twirl throwing me half from my saddle.
 Chevelle caught my arm and righted me on my now-still horse.
 “Maybe not so severe next time.” My face heated, but I focused on the horse’s head again, turning him back to our course as I gave a small nudge with my heels.
 I was cautious after that but it became easier to control his movement as we rode.
 I practiced guiding him, eventually even maneuvering him back and forth between the misshapen rocks and spiky brush on our way.
 I was still afraid to have him kneel when we stopped for the evening, though, imagining him rolling on top of me if I tried.
 I slid down and stretched my legs, glad for a rest after the hours of tensing every time the horse changed direction.

"I'm sorry."
 Partly for him but mostly for herself.
 What would he say if he knew that she sometimes went to a speakeasy?
 He'd probably kill her.
 Davis, having missed the irony in her tone, took her hand.
 "Why don't we go back to your house and listen to the radio?"
 That idea appealed to her very much.
 Her parents were out, so she and Davis would be alone.
 Normally, she wouldn't dare be alone at home with a man--her father would be furious.
 But he trusted Davis with her.

The flaming whip appeared, charring grass as it touched the ground.
 “Then what do you want with me?” the man shrieked.
 “You’ll see,” Harruq whispered into his ear before backing away.
 The eyes of the nobleman grew wider, and panic gripped him entirely.
 “No, no you can’t.
 You wouldn’t!
 Please, I beg of you, don’t…”
 “Enough,” Qurrah said.
 His hand reached out, the tips of his fingers brushing the sides of the man’s face.
 Haunting words of magic flowed from the necromancer’s mouth.

For the collective, development involves establishment of more useful and productive institutions, systems, organizations and cultural values.
 The conventional view that development is essentially a function of scarce economic inputs must give way to the perception that the opportunities and potentials for rapid development far exceed actual achievements in every country.
 Looking back over the past few decades, we realize that the speed of social progress could certainly have been much greater than it was.
 The tremendous potential for accelerating development is most easily illustrated by in stances in which actual achievements substantially excelled expectations, such as the enormous leap in world agriculture during the 1960s and 1970s and the phenomenal growth of incomes, employment and exports in East Asia during the last ten years.
 These unforeseen accomplishments reflect the magnitude of potentials that these countries possessed but had not previously utilized.
 The untapped resources of the society can be categorized under several headings:
 Knowledge of the process of development and the factors that stimulate it.
 Education that imparts progressive social values and practically useful perspectives.
 Information that creates awareness of opportunities.
 Values that foster productivity, organization and social cohesion.

Having rejected the inadequacies and abuses of authoritarian socialism as a solution, we are compelled to find other methods to achieve social equity.
 In the present context, employment is the most effective way to distribute the fruits of development among people.
 The world is now capable of producing sufficient food and other basic necessities to feed, clothe and house everyone; but without opportunities for employment, people lack the purchasing power needed to buy them.
 Economic entitlement, rather than a shortage of food or food production capacity, is the key to global food security.
 Lack of employment opportunities is also directly linked to destruction of the environment, both rural and urban.
 The destruction of tropical rain forests has been one result.
 The greatest security challenges of the twenty-first century are economic, not military or political.
 Employment is a sine qua non for meeting these challenges.
 A thorough examination of facts and a dispassionate analysis reveal grounds for hope and opportunities for action.
 The possibility of more rapid economic growth and rising incomes in both developed and developing countries – spurred by further substantial reduction in defence spending, the diffusion and application of new technologies, economic liberalization leading to growth of international trade, the globalization of financial markets, and the emergence of new engines for global expansion among developing countries – indicates that our apprehensions need not prove justified, provided society acts courageously and decisively to meet the challenge.

The worst seemed to be about the middle of Celed and steadily working its way south.
 They encountered a few soldiers as they hurried there.
 All died before they had the chance to swing their blades.
 “At last!” Felewen cried, staring out from a side alley.
 They were behind a group of ten soldiers battling a pair of elven warriors who stood back to back.
 “Make haste, they need us!”
 Felewen charged, desperate to arrive before her brethren were overwhelmed.
 Aurelia stepped into the street and summoned her magic.
 Frost surrounded her hands, and a thin sheet of ice spread beneath the human soldiers.
 Many of them stumbled, unable to balance the sword and shield in their hands and the heavy chainmail on their bodies.

That God likes Eugene.
 Art – At that I can only wonder why.
 Jim – I think it’s because Gene just doesn’t give up.
 Either that or he just keeps God amused with his foolishness.
 Art – Jim, that’s not true.
 He gives up all the time.
 When was the last time he actually saw one of his schemes through to the end?
 Jim – His little plans are nothing.
 If one fails he tries something else.
 The schemes are just a part of his bigger goal of making a huge nuisance of himself and not getting killed while doing it.

 Just excuse yourself and leave.
 No mess, no pain, and no hurt feelings.

 Jim – Tried that too, did you know that your mother carries around a bottle of stomach tonic with he in her purse?

The Council library was overwhelming.
 It housed copies of all the books in the village library as well as hundreds more that were too delicate or important for public use.
 And if you believed Fannie’s theories, they held secret documents here as well, things they didn’t want commonly known.
 The walls were stark white, like carved marble, and the room felt cold and empty, despite the abundance inside.
 I found a shelf to hide behind and placed my pilfered documents on the floor.
 I examined the shelves in front of me, looking for a match to the symbols, and found the sections to be arranged by groups, each shelf divided by categories within.
 I walked the library in search of the section marked for either of the characters listed on my documents, and was about to give up when I noticed some encased racks in the center of the room.
 I checked the small section, seeing immediately the symbols fit.
 I smiled, thinking how easy it had been as I slid my fingertips across the volumes on that shelf.
 My fingers tingled as they crossed a thin section of pages bound together.

“We can’t just leave them out there.” I knew Chevelle’s voice, interlaced between the other comments.
 “She’s not ready… we can’t… too soon.” And a voice I couldn’t place.
 “… another setback…” They seemed to be in disagreement but I couldn’t find the interest to stay with them.
 I faded back into sleep.
 These dreams took me farther.
 My sight was off, not as clear, distorted.
 But as I lingered there, I knew the cause.
 I was seeing from a horse.
 We were outside the stone walls of the fortress finding sparse greens to eat, which bored me even in a dream.
 I encouraged the horse to run and he responded immediately, taking flight down the mountainside.

I jumped to my feet and almost ran for Alec, but she grabbed my hand with more of that fragile strength, and pulled me back down.
 "There isn't anything he can do for me, child, and unless I'm very much mistaken he's more than normally worried right now.
 He's in no kind of way needing yet more to fret about.
 Just let me catch my breath and I'll be as right as ever."
 Several minutes later, once the renewed bout of coughing had subsided, Mallory looked back up at me with wan features.
 "How did it happen?
 What brought things between Brandon and our Alec to a head?"
 "It was my fault.
 I'd been dating Brandon, and we went to a party.
 Only while we were there he tried to do things I wasn't comfortable with.

She cracked her staff across his back.
 Harruq stumbled into the portal and vanished.
 Aurelia stepped in after, arrows landing all around her.

 Qurrah watched the blue portal close, leaving him alone and hunted in a town full of enemies.
 “Brother, how could you?” he asked, dread clutching his throat.
 Elves were running down the alley, yelling in their language.
 Qurrah ducked back around, cursed his brother, and then darted to the nearest home.
 The first one had locks, as did the second, but the third was unbarred.

And, what for a Memphis musician is worse, so soulless.
 Buddy had gone to hell, many in Memphis thought, though no one said so.
 There was, for a homegrown prodigy, still respect, pride, a sort of sweetly sad valediction.
 When Buddy was buried in L.A. that was the final blow.
 His parents flew out for the interment but no one else from Memphis went.
 It is said there were many celebrities there.
 I hope so.
 I hope he drew a crowd at the end, a healthy gate-count.
 Jack Nicholson was there.
 Debbie Anspach, Donald Sutherland, Larry Hagman, Candice Bergen, Dennis Hopper, Jagger, Ringo.

True communism has never existed.
 What lived and has finally died in Eastern Europe is not communism, but statism, the domination of the state and use of state authority to govern the life of the nation, in practice reducing people to forced labour.
 True capitalism, which regards people as a factor of production, passed away more than half a century ago, when the challenge of communism prompted Western societies to incorporate socialist principles and measures to mitigate the blind justice of the free market.
 There are no true capitalist societies in the world.
 There are no free markets.
 The free market system is highly regulated and controlled by the very state over which it claims victory.
 But although in reality both systems are dead, the ideology of the capitalist system lives on and casts an illusory impression of supremacy.
 Rather than searching for a victor and vanquished, the urgent need is to find a successor that combines and synthesizes the enlightened values of both systems – freedom and equality, liberty and security.
 It has been amply proved that the authoritarian state is incapable of exerting a benevolent authority over the people without imposing severe restrictions on freedom, stifling human energy and creativity, leading sooner or later to rising discontent and a loss of social vitality.
 It is also abundantly clear that money as an institution operating through the free pricing mechanism of the market system – although it does succeed in generating high levels of energy, creativity and productivity – regards people as a purchasable commodity or a potential market, but is otherwise indifferent to human values and welfare.

Cindi and I looked nothing like Mom.
 She was all dark, wavy hair, olive skin and at five-three hadn't been able to kiss Dad unless he bent down.
 Dad was the one who gave us the blond hair and a shot at maybe hitting an average height.
 I could see his handsome face smiling at me now, trying to coax me up into the tree with Cindi.
 The vision lasted only as long as it took me to hit the floor.
 I could always judge how long I'd been out by my mom's expression when I came to.
 That and whether or not I'd seriously injured myself on the way down.
 She looked concerned, but not desperate yet.
 Her cell phone was in her hand, but not yet flipped open.
 It probably hadn't been more than eight or nine minutes.

And then the questions.
 Had the Council known she’d gone running because I laughed at her?
 Had the thistle grown as she stood beside me?
 Was that what had caused the sneezing?
 Evelyn would tell them I was there.
 They would come for me.
 There would be another inquisition.
 What had the Council member told Fannie?
 He must have known I was a witness, why else would he have been there?
 I could still see the anger on her face.

Conduct a comprehensive study of successful management practices, systems and institutions from both developing and developed countries that can be transferred and adapted to local conditions in or der to accelerate development in each field of activity.
 Evolve new organizational patterns for existing industries based on adaptation of new technologies in small, geographically decentralized, labour-intensive production units in order to make these industries more responsive, flexible, efficient and competitive.
 8.Extend basic education: A distinguishing feature of the East Asian countries has been their emphasis during the early stage of industrialization on primary and secondary education, especially in rural areas.
 This strategy increases the productivity of the mass of the workforce, helps promote income equality, consumer spending power and broad support for high growth and pro-business policies.
 Raise the educational qualifications of the workforce to the level pertaining in more economically advanced nations.
 Place particular emphasis on primary and secondary education, rural education and education of young girls.
 9.Disseminate information: Encourage the establishment of new institutions, programmes and systems to speed and extend the dissemination of practically useful information as a powerful catalyst for more rapid social progress.
 Encourage a national climate of open-mindedness to foreign ideas, influences and success stories.
 10.Increase the velocity of money and other transactions: Increase the speed of commercial transactions, especially money flows, in the economy by streamlining government and banking procedures, ensuring rapid utilization of funds by all government agencies, setting strict limits on the time taken for bank transfers, introducing agencies for credit verification and collection of unpaid bills, and improving the telecommunications infrastructure.
 11.Revamp higher education: Educational systems which 'manufacture graduates' compound the problem rather than alleviating it.

He looked about sixteen.
 His haircut might have come from a Marine base.
 He wore glasses and a smile I interpreted as phony.
 He passed out a Bible tract, a directory of churches, and a card with his name and phone number.
 I thought, call you for what?
 This kid, I believed, had spent more time in church than outside in the real world.
 He hadn’t attended a dozen funerals, known anyone like Eric, read Nietzsche or Dostoyevski.
 Most of all, he wasn’t Billy Graham.
 Besides, I glanced to the right of the kid and saw the babe with auburn curls.
 She stood with hands folded at her waist and creamy white legs quivering below the hem of her flowered sundress.

“A horse is at the door.” Chevelle glanced at me, I hoped he didn’t see my smile.
 I knew it was my Steed.
 Grey waited.
 “Well, should I let him in?” Chevelle nodded once and Grey left as quickly as he’d entered.
 And then I realized he’d walked through a door.
 I glanced around, confused about where I was.
 Gray stone walls surrounded us, but I’d been staring at an open sky, nothing but the cloak between my prone form and the cold earth.
 “Where are we?” “Fort Stone,” Steed answered.
 I snickered and Chevelle’s irritation resurfaced.
 I didn’t know if it was for me or Steed.

Had the greater sigils been gifts to mortals from the Gods themselves?
 Rodregas yearned to reach out and touch to see if they felt like flesh or stone.
 But, to do so would set his path for the rest of his life.
 If he was truly strong enough for two as Imeralda thought, then he could be a lion and what else?
 “Well, Doi’van, what do you think?” Rodregas asked.
 “I am going to choose lion, but it would be great to have a pride, or maybe the Moon Wolf or the Mountain Bear.” Doi’van nodded and walked over to the bear.
 It was a kind of bear that Rodregas had not heard of in the mortal world, even larger than ‘his’ lion.
 The bear actually had a thick tail and its teeth seemed far larger than any bear he had heard of.
 Doi’van stood there looking up at the great beast for a long moment.
 Then he cocked his head; his nose went up as if he smelled something.

I was so tired of it all.
 By the time English rolled around my natural embarrassment had given way to actual anger at Britney for starting it all.
 She tried to catch me at our lockers in between classes, but I pretended not to hear her, and made it safely into Mr. Whethers' class before she could catch up.
 Part of me acknowledged how petty it was, but I avoided her attempts at a whispered conversation during class.
 Mr. Whethers unknowingly helped my cause, when he crossly silenced a couple of girls on the far side of the classroom.
 He was normally so even-tempered that even his moderate rebuke instantly shut them up.
 I probably shouldn't have felt quite so happy about it, but I was pretty sure from the way they'd been looking at me that I'd been the source of their gossip.
 When the bell finally released us, I couldn't avoid Britney any longer.
 "Adri...ana, why didn't you tell me?"
 I didn't answer for several seconds, not sure I'd actually heard her right.

Anything out of the ordinary is instantly gossip fodder.
 I'll bet half the town knew you and your mom had purchased the old Anderson house before the ink was dry on the mortgage.
 The other half learned about it at church the next day."
 I tried to smile, but I found it more than a little unnerving.
 Big city life hadn't been so intrusive.
 I hadn't even known my neighbors growing up.
 In Minneapolis the people you lived next to and the people you associated with were always kept properly segregated.
 I tuned back into what Britney was saying just in time to answer a question with something safely non-committal.
 She didn't seem to need much in the way of responses to keep her talking.
 Probably for hours if she could get away with it.

No doubt he could have told me the theme wasn’t much different from my dream of going off with Karen to a secluded cabin, or from my quitting the baseball team so I could spend afternoons alone smashing golf balls.
 But Eric rarely gave answers to questions we could solve on our own.
 In that, he was like God, who perhaps respects us more than we deserve.
 In The Brothers Karamazov, Fyodor Dostoyevski gives a story of Jesus coming to earth during the Spanish inquisition.
 He only heals a few of the suffering crowd before soldiers arrest and deliver him to the Grand Inquisitor.
 That old fellow commences to tell him where he went wrong.
 Jesus, says this astute theologian, attempted to give people freedom, when most of them want nothing to do with freedom.
 Their cravings are for food and other comforts, for easy answers to questions no matter how complex or perplexing, and for entertainment, to relieve them of the need to think.
 Eric, like Jesus, loved people too much to usurp their freedom by giving them what their lesser natures wanted.

surely he wasn't going to ask-- "Will you marry me, Marie?"
 She looked from the beautiful ring to his anxious face.
 Tears filled her eyes.
 "I can't, Rick.

 I-I just—I have to go home."
 He swallowed, looking down at the ring.
 "I thought maybe you loved me too.
 I thought--" "I do love you."

Brandon was still smiling, but I got the feeling that it was a little more forced.
 "Perfect.

 Mrs. Campbell looked up from the plant she was watering as we walked into the tutoring room.
 "Ah, there you two are.
 Britney, you'll be sitting over there from now on.
 Adriana, go ahead and get started on your homework.
 When you finish come find me and we'll get you situated."
 As always, Rachel was sitting at her table in the middle of no-man's-land.
 She looked up at me and smiled as I took my usual spot and started on my homework.

Her last words confirmed it.
 “No one knew to check.
 How would they?
 I mean, a new species.
 A new breed.
 And lethal.
 Poison to her mother.
 They couldn’t even know that was what had happened until the others.
 Until the pattern became patent and they found the source.” I stared at Ruby, imagining the nameless “others” who’d been taken by her venom before they discovered its root.
 But it was not the idea of those strangers that tightened my chest.

 She frowned for a minute, trying to see all this from his point of view.
 It must be as strange for him as it was for her--a woman from the past had walked into his garden.
 He didn't believe in such things any more than she did, but he'd done his best to help her get back.
 And he'd been so kind and considerate, introducing her to the marvels of his time, seeing to her comfort, holding her when she was frightened .
 .

 He really was very handsome, she mused, sinking deeper into the water.

 I must leave and go back to her...” “Wait a minute!” Seth exclaimed, jumping up.
 “You're leaving us?
 You little...” “Seth!” I protested and stepped in front of him.
 “Don't you dare think about killing him.
 He got us here-” “And he's leaving us here in some random place when we have no clue what to do or where we're going,” Seth interrupted me.
 The dwarf shook his head.
 “I'm very sorry, sir, but her majesty told me to bring you here and then to report back.
 I must tell her about the ambush, someone knew I was bringing you here.” “Don't you have to bring us to her?” Seth asked.
 The dwarf cocked his head.

I didn’t want to make it worse by revealing what I knew.
 When I didn’t reply, she covered her mouth with her hand to try to cover her chuckles.
 “Oh then,” she giggled, “I hope you two had a nice chat.” “Stop it Emily!” I snapped and felt my face burn.
 She snickered.
 “Okay whatever you say, Jazell.” “We have to tell you guys something,” I told her and Jason about how the dwarf had showed up and what he said about Igneeria.
 Emily listened quietly but when I got to the part that we were supposed to go there, her mouth fell open.
 “That’s completely crazy!” Emily gasped.
 “We’re supposed to just leave and go there?
 What about our parents?” “He told me, and I quote, ‘Miss did you not think that her majesty would have this all planned out?
 You don’t have to worry.’ I personally think it’s all a little skeptical, don’t you?” “Yes,” she said, digging for a pencil and paper from my bag, “I do.

Its calls for a standing world army, for the recognition of full employment as a fundamental right and for the elimination of protectionist trade policies to mention but a few examples will cause some sharp intakes of breath among world leaders.
 Indeed, the report contains many ideas that merit and should stimulate further reflection.
 The situation of the countries in transition in Eastern Europe, high lighted in this report, illustrates perfectly the need for an integrated approach to development considered as a total human process.
 The Commission's report contains specific proposals in this regard as well as an overview pointing to existing domestic assets of various kinds which could help the countries concerned.
 It addresses the topic of job creation with innovative ideas on the roles of technology and trade, and emphasizes the significance of the developing countries and agricul ture in the world economy.
 Its global education programme proposal placing appropriate emphasis on the key issue of girls' and women's education is one that particularly commends itself to UNESCO, which is already actively engaged in efforts along similar lines in conjunction with its UN partners.
 This timely report should help to promote the idea of human-centred development within a culture of peace as a way forward to a better world.
 We are gratified that ICPF should have assigned UNESCO, as the intellectual arm of the United Nations, a prominent role in its recommended agenda for action, and we reaffirm our commit ment to working with all possible partners in pursuit of the goal of global peace and sustainable human development.
 Federico Mayor Director General UNESCO
 The International Commission on Peace and Food began its work at a time of uncommon opportunities for rapid transition on a global scale to democratic ways of life, freedom of the media, and an independent judiciary; food, literacy, health and jobs for all; and sustainable life styles based on harmony between humankind and nature.

One of the most serious consequences of this trend is the linkage between small arms proliferation and the drugs trade.
 The use of and trade in narcotics represents a menace not only to the health and well-being of individuals and societies, but also to international security.
 The scale of the problem can be judged by the reported fact that Americans, who represent five per cent of the world’s population, consume fifty per cent of the world’s cocaine.
 In Pakistan, where there were virtually no drug addicts a decade ago, it has been reported that as many as 3 per cent of the population are addicted and thrice that number use drugs frequently.
 The CIS has now been added to the traditional drugs routes emanating from the Peru–Colombia–Panama, Pakistan–Afghanistan, and Myanmar–Thailand–Laos regions.
 The drugs menace is transnational in character with far-reaching implications for societal and international peace and security.
 The countries and regions which produce these drugs, and through which the trade flows, have been afflicted by endemic violence and social turbulence.
 A similar impact occurs at the point of concentrated consumption, especially in the inner cities of America, where crime and murder rates have soared due to drug-related violence.
 Inevitably, drug trafficking is linked with illicit arms, terrorist groups and the Mafia.
 Criminal elements are increasingly gaining control over the administrative and political structures of drug-producing states, where drug-related corruption permeates the military and government.

 Rick handed Marie his handkerchief.

 But I have to tell you that I'd give anything in this world to have you stay here with me.
 I love you so much."
 Fresh tears rolled down her cheeks, and she laid her head on his shoulder.
 She dabbed at her tears with Rick's handkerchief, noticing that it smelled like his cologne.

Once we had finished forsaking, we would metamorphose into lions and proceed to slay the dragon called "Thou Shalt".
 After burying the dragon, the lion would die and resurrect as a child, the infant superman, innocent and forgiving, a new beginning, a sacred Yes.
 Then, we could discover and assert our own wills, and use those wills to conquer and change the world.
 On a Sunday morning in January, a few days before my mom’s release from the hospital, a gang of us high school boys sat naked atop a giant flat boulder in a desert oasis called Palm Canyon, a few miles out of Borrego Springs and a two-mile trek past the end of a dirt road.
 We were a savage crew, six sunburnt white boys, all but one of us bald since we had shaved our heads in protest against a track coach who ordered Bill Torrey, Cliff’s younger brother, to get his shaggy hair mowed.
 We had been seven until Tom, whose last name I will keep to myself, disappeared on Friday night.
 Steve Havens had invited him along, because Tom was a lonely fellow and Steve was a churchgoing boy with an inclination toward good deeds.
 A half-hour into the trip we all, even Steve, regretted bringing Tom.
 All the way over the mountains, he had criticized us, for opening a window, calling for a pit stop, and choosing the wrong direction at a crossroads.
 In the desert he turned into a pyromaniac, pelted us with fiery sticks and blew one of our sleeping bags to shreds with cherry bombs.

How did you survive your mom?
 Jim – A good friend of mine, you may know him, saved me.
 Liz – oh?
 Who?
 Jim – Sumo Assa…
 Liz – Not that stupid comic book character.
 I thought you grew out of that.
 What is with you and those stupid comic books?
 You could have at least picked something good like Batman.
 Jim – Sumo has always been there for me in my times of need.

Do you need something?"
 "Donovan, Alec said I could go watch them work out.
 Will you take me to wherever they are?"
 He dried his hands on a blisteringly white towel, and nodded.
 "Of course.
 I believe they are in the north end of the valley.
 Right this way."
 We made good time, even with Donovan's jerky, oftentimes painful gait, but the estate was even bigger than I'd realized.
 We walked for several minutes before rounding a corner and finding the entrance to a hedge maze.
 "We're very nearly there.

I peered at the entrance of the cave to see that outside it was dark.
 I walked toward the entrance when something stopped me.
 “Don't go into the shadows, Jazell,” a familiar voice said.
 It was the voice from my last dream.
 I whirled around in a circle, looking for the source of the voice.
 There was nothing here.
 “Who are you?” I asked, trying to calm down.
 “Can I trust you?” “Trust me like your shadow,” the voice said again.
 “But you said to beware of shadows,” I said.
 “So does that mean I can't trust you?” “You know your shadow, there is a difference,” the voice said again.

She’d strolled through her garden countless times without walking into 2011, so who knew how many times she’d have to walk in the garden to get back to 1927?
 She wasn’t going to give up.
 Rick, still concerned about Marie, left work at 4:30, making a quick stop to pick up a surprise for her.
 To his dismay, he found her huddled in a corner of the sofa, still wearing her 1927 clothes.
 “Hi, sweetheart,” he greeted her, going to sit beside her.
 “Are you feeling better?” “I’m all right.” “I brought you something.”  He handed her a plastic bag.
 She took it and reached inside.
 “Wow!” she exclaimed as she withdrew the 16-ounce Hershey bar.
 “I’ve never seen a chocolate bar this big.” “Me either.
 It was part of a promotional display.” She tore it open, breaking off a chunk.

The hot air felt good, and it was making her hair fluffy.
 Unfortunately, she didn't have any curling tongs, and her too-long hair, now perfectly straight, hung past her shoulders.
 With a sigh, she parted her hair in the middle and went downstairs.
 "Hair all dry?"
 Rick asked.
 "Hey--your hair looks great!
 It looks longer now."
 "It was curled before--that makes it look shorter.
 I need to get it cut."
 "No!"

Rachel was nicer, but she was still a Graves.
 Maybe this was just a sign of things to come.
 Apparently I wasn't the only one put off by Alec's snobbishness.
 A couple of guys who looked like they were old enough to be in college were rolling their eyes at him.
 They were whispering and laughing, but positioned as they were closer to Alec than to me, I couldn't make out any of what they were saying.
 While I agreed completely with their sentiment, they were so loud they were disturbing at least twenty or thirty people.
 Hopefully they'd quiet down once the actual show started up.
 Judging by the orchestra, it was almost time.
 I looked back, intending to shoot the obnoxious pair a nasty glare in the hopes it would shut them up, and instead caught Alec's eye.
 The house lights were still bright enough for me to make out every detail of his perfect face, and yet I was still baffled by his expression.

 The broad range of topics examined by the International Commission on Peace and Food demonstrates the interrelated nature of the challenges of peace and development.
 Your collective endeavour illustrates the fact that no longer can global peace and security remain the preserve of political and military specialists.
 Without an adequate development effort, there can be no lasting peace and security.
 Conflicts over resources, ultra-nationalism exacerbated by the tensions of unemployment, poverty and despair at home will inevitably lead to resentment, and resentment turns only too easily into armed conflict.
 The establishment of secure foundations for peace will be aided by development and post-conflict peace building.

He even apologized the first time.
 And when I did let him kiss me, he said he'd rather die than ever hurt me."
 Mrs. Tranton reached out to play with a lock of her daughter's hair.
 "Is that why you think he's wonderful?"
 "That's just part of it.
 He spent every evening with me and all weekend.
 He even came home from work earlier than he had been just to be with me.
 And he took me--places."
 She'd started to say to Hollywood, but her mother might start asking questions about exactly where she'd been and why she hadn't been able to get home.
 "We-we went to the--we went shopping.

Alec seemed like the type who'd force a decision just because he could.
 I felt my heart go crazy at the same time tears started gathering at the corner of my eyes.
 It was stupid to have risked a panic attack when I was already borderline depressed, but that was what I was looking at now.
 I'd picked a seat that wasn't visible from the doorway, so I just put my head down and let the twin traumas run their course.
 By the time I was feeling steady enough to leave the classroom, I had just enough time to make it to the bathroom and try to clean myself up before lunch ended.
 The rest of the day went in starts and stutters.
 I went from answering a question about the economy of post-Civil War Georgia, to watching Alec start putting together rough plans for our next group project.
 I had just enough time to notice he seemed relieved I wasn't trying to get in his way, and then Spanish was finishing up and I was headed to the tutoring lab.
 Most Friday afternoon sessions were pretty sparsely attended.
 Today was no different, which was a good thing since I probably wouldn't have done a very good job of explaining anything.

And when I asked him why he wanted to be a knight…” she paused then added, “he said that some ‘Infernally damned knights’ have to stand up and fight.” “So you think he is a good man?” Rodregas asked.
 “I think Geriodon is a ‘holier than thou’ stick in the mud, who needs to learn to bathe and not mumble when he speaks.
 And yes, he is probably one of the only men here that actually deserves knighthood.” Rodregas nodded and said, “What about Nordien?” “Nordien is the polar opposite to Geriodon; smooth and friendly… and tried to have sex with me within our first conversation, which was also the only decent thing he said during our conversation.
 He seems to really dislike Geriodon and Karun.
 He comes from a strong blood line and rich family and feels he should already be a knight and not be forced to be in the tournament.” “So, why is Nordien in the tournament and not knighted?” Rodregas asked.
 “From what I can gather, Nordien is very friendly with the Immortalists, including the Ambassador Van’dret, and most people believe that he only wants to be knighted so that he can then leave the knighthood and join the Immortal Guard.” Rodregas nodded.
 That was not too surprising; since such ex-knights are usually made officers.
 Greater sigils were much more rare in the Guard than the knighthood, not to mention the officers of the Immortal Guard lived in much nicer style than the knighthood.
 “The Knight Commander might not be willing to stand up to the Immortalists, but he would be more than willing to skip over giving knighthood to someone who was planning to leave anyhow,” said Rodregas.
 They had made it to the stables and Doi’van started to put the saddle and tack onto Doom Hoof, the horse that Doi’van had been riding.

But you…”
 Again that greedy look.
 “You are extraordinary.
 I do not have to give you unearned power.
 I must simply guide and instruct.” Velixar stood, and when his power flared, Qurrah fell to his knees and worshipped his new master.
 “You are what I have searched for all these years.
 You and I will destroy this world side by side.
 We will lay waste to all life and put absolute order upon every last soul.”
 “Teach me,” Qurrah said, his mouth buried into the dirt.
 “Show me the power I have sought for so very long.”

“About what?” Shaking her hair out of her face, she looked up at him.
 “Why do you think this happened to me?
 I mean, we’ve tried to figure out how I can get back, but we don’t even know why it happened.” “I don’t know, Marie.
 I still can’t really believe it happened.
 If you hadn’t been scared half to death, I would have thought you were playing a joke on me.” She smiled a bit.
 “If you’re playing a joke on me, I want to take one of your televisions home with me.”  Returning her attention to the mushroom, she frowned.
 “And that’s another thing—why 84 years in the future?
 Why not five years?
 Or 100 years—at least that’s a round number.
 Why the year 2011?” Her questions made him reflect uncomfortably.

Britney caught me registering the fact she was driving under the speed limit for the first time I could remember, and broke off recounting Amy Stevens' supposed fling with one of the football players just long enough to blush.
 "I figured I should be more careful of how fast I drive.
 You know, my dad keeps threatening to take away my car if I get any more tickets.
 With everything else going on right now he just might do it."
 It was actually pretty plausible.
 I probably would've believed it if not for Rachel's description of the new rumor floating around school.
 Britney was trying to cater to my supposed fear of being in a speeding car.
 Only, my supposed fear was actually a very real fear, just not for the reasons Britney thought.
 Chapter 11 Brandon arrived just in time to pick me up before I got on the bus.
 As expected, he teased me about not waiting for him at my house, but it was a small price to pay for not having to worry about how I was going to get to school if he didn't show up.

A similar impact occurs at the point of concentrated consumption, especially in the inner cities of America, where crime and murder rates have soared due to drug-related violence.
 Inevitably, drug trafficking is linked with illicit arms, terrorist groups and the Mafia.
 Criminal elements are increasingly gaining control over the administrative and political structures of drug-producing states, where drug-related corruption permeates the military and government.
 Neither the proliferation of small arms, nor the proliferation of drugs, nor the growth of terrorist and criminal activity can be solved as isolated problems, or by the independent initiatives of individual states.
 No country is exempt from the danger, which will continue to multiply unless checked and eradicated by concerted international action.
 Urgent steps are needed to classify and register small arms production and trade, to monitor and control their manufacture and limit their export.
 Agreements are needed to reduce production and severely restrict sales.
 Strong sanctions must be instituted to discourage states from actively or passively aiding or abetting small arms proliferation.
 The scope of the UN Conventional Arms Register should be expanded to cover small arms, but at the same time its provisions must be greatly strengthened in order to make this an effective mechanism.
 Reporting must be made mandatory rather than voluntary, and an independent surveillance system should be established to monitor compliance.

 Johnny – I don’t watch Gene do anything.
 I just wish he’d get outta here.
 Jim – Maybe if you’re lucky, and ask nicely, he’ll teach you about Canada.
 Then my beloved brother, you can pretend to fit in, but secretly work for the resistance forces.
 Liz – That just may work.
 Jim – You’re our only hope Johnny boy.
 All our hopes for freedom ride on your capable shoulders!
 To victory!
 Johnny – Then you’re screwed jack-ass, I’d rather stand in front of a speeding train and try to stop it with just my psychic powers than to spend an extra minute around that moron.

 _The red eyes flared in laughter._ Can you trust anyone?
 _Qurrah crawled faster, knowing the dream was ending.
 But it couldn’t end.
 He had to know.
 He had to decide._

The use of and trade in narcotics represents a menace not only to the health and well-being of individuals and societies, but also to international security.
 The scale of the problem can be judged by the reported fact that Americans, who represent five per cent of the world’s population, consume fifty per cent of the world’s cocaine.
 In Pakistan, where there were virtually no drug addicts a decade ago, it has been reported that as many as 3 per cent of the population are addicted and thrice that number use drugs frequently.
 The CIS has now been added to the traditional drugs routes emanating from the Peru–Colombia–Panama, Pakistan–Afghanistan, and Myanmar–Thailand–Laos regions.
 The drugs menace is transnational in character with far-reaching implications for societal and international peace and security.
 The countries and regions which produce these drugs, and through which the trade flows, have been afflicted by endemic violence and social turbulence.
 A similar impact occurs at the point of concentrated consumption, especially in the inner cities of America, where crime and murder rates have soared due to drug-related violence.
 Inevitably, drug trafficking is linked with illicit arms, terrorist groups and the Mafia.
 Criminal elements are increasingly gaining control over the administrative and political structures of drug-producing states, where drug-related corruption permeates the military and government.

He was pretty much crazy.
 Johnny – And we’re related to him.
 Jim – Yes we are.
 Course it didn’t make him all that happy.
 That and he hated dad from the beginning because dad isn’t a religious person, and that dad had the audacity to question anything grandpa said.
 They didn’t get along at all.
 It’s amazing that mom and dad actually got married.
 He spent years trying to talk mom into out of dating dad, and finally he all but disowned her when they got married.
 Johnny – That’s news to me.
 Jim - They didn’t talk about it all that much.

All the guards had been confused as to why Ravenhurr had kept him, as it was against the Guild rules to use any of the Hellborn in the ceremony.
 The Immortalist was trying to become Celestial not a member of the Infernal realms.
 It was a very stringent rule that everyone knew not to break, not that any of the guards was going to mention it to the Guild.
 “Who are you?” asked the man that Rodregas had tagged as ‘the leader.’ “I am not sure who I am,” Rodregas responded.
 “And I think I will keep any answers that I figure out to myself for now.” “You are not Gerald though are you?” asked the AElf maiden.
 “Not to ask a dumb question,” Rodregas asked in a curious tone “but who is Gerald?”  Silence followed his query but finally he got an answer.
 “He is the man that you appear to be, whose body you now… have,” responded the maiden.
 “And what are you five named?” Rodregas asked.
 There was a pause at his question.
 He knew this was an important moment because once people say who they are they are much less likely to do violence.

Her fingers lingered against his during the exchange and my chest felt like it was blistering inside.
 They were whispering about me.
 My watcher.
 This woman.
 Chevelle’s gaze brushed mine once more and I hungered to hear what they were saying.
 I was fixated on it, my mind spinning, convinced that if I were as invisible as everyone thought, if they truly couldn’t see me, at least I could get closer and finally know.
 As I shook my head at the idea, my eyes fell downward.
 A small scream escaped.
 My arms were covered in tree bark, blending seamlessly with the stump on which I sat.
 I bolted upright, batting at them as if my shirt were on fire.

It can impart knowledge of opportunities, attitudes that support constructive initiative and skills for productive application.
 Production technologies that make consumer goods available at lower and lower cost to more and more people also level social differences by extending the benefit of development more widely and evenly.
 The soaring of human aspirations is a natural and irresistible result of goals that humankind has been striving for over the last century.
 It is a direct product of the great advances in freedom and democracy, human rights, social equality for women and minorities, health and education, science and technology, the rule of law, social institutions and social welfare.
 Society has no alternative but to meet these growing expectations by channelling the awakened energies into productive pursuits.
 For that we need to acquire a greater understanding of the social and psychological process that has already enabled so many to achieve so much.
 The challenge and the opportunity now presented is to make conscious the previously unconscious process of development, to accelerate it, and to convert the revolution of rising social expectations into a positive energizing movement of the entire global society.
 This is the all-powerful driving force that has so radically transformed the social landscape during this ‘century of the common man’.
 This is the ultimate ‘rationale’ behind the inevitable claim of the poor everywhere that will be made with ever-growing insistence and impatience until it is finally granted – as the birthright of every human being – freedom, food, education, employment, prosperity and fulfilment for all.

"Are you crazy?
 First you side with Rachel against Brandon, firmly putting yourself in Alec's camp, and then you turn around and piss off Alec?"
 I really wasn't in the mood to argue with Britney, so I tried for nonchalance.
 "So now I'm not on anyone's side.
 They'll both leave me alone and I'll be fine."
 "Oh, yeah, because that's how things work."
 I'd only thought Britney was mad before.
 She was all but shaking with fury now.
 "Don't you get it?
 You, me, most of the rest of the school, we survive by staying neutral.

This has been all but inevitable since Alec's father died.
 From the moment they were born, I could tell that both Alec and Brandon had been gifted with uncommon potential for power."
 My blank look apparently made her take pity on me.
 "I'm sorry.
 I forget you're not aware of my special gift.
 I see inside people.
 Shape shifters really, but every once in a while normal humans as well.
 I can see their potential, and when they develop gifts, I can see the shape those gifts have taken."
 "Gifts?"

The Right to Employment
 The transformation of social life in this century has drawn hundreds of millions of people away from a subsistence level existence in agriculture to urban areas and industrial employment.
 In the process it has brought about an unprecedented advancement in living standards around the world.
 But it has also engendered a way of life in which the livelihood of individuals is far more dependent than in the past on external conditions – the state of the national and global economy, trade policies, interest and exchange rates, levels of military spending and overall consumer demand.
 Modern society, even in the most liberal democracies, has become so structured that it leaves less and less freedom for truly independent individual initiative.
 Today, government intervenes in virtually every aspect of society’s economic existence, restricting the freedom of the individual to seek his or her own livelihood and determining the type and number of job opportunities available.
 Employment opportunities are directly linked to government tax policy concerning capital gains, depreciation, energy, wages and salaries, as well as by policies governing minimum wage laws, interest rates, budget deficits, imports and exports, environmental regulations and restrictions, defence spending, immigration, industrial development, investment, licensing of practitioners, zoning laws and countless other public policy issues.
 Without access to jobs, people lack the ability to ensure their own survival and support in modern society.
 As government has assured the right to education – indeed, compels it – it can and must also ensure the right of every person to gainful employment.
 Our very concept of the rights of the individual and the responsibilities of the society must undergo radical change.

The entrails went into an urn beside the fire and I wondered what she used them for before remembering all the containers on her bedroom shelf with a shudder.
 She stretched the pelt to dry while the meat cooked.
 She poured us wine and handed me half of her plunder.
 “It’s not much, but game close to the village is sparse.
 Over-hunted.
 When we get to the peak, we can trade.
 It is the strangest thing; they herd the animals to town and then corral them to eat at their leisure.” She shook her head at the absurdity.
 “But you haven’t eaten until you’ve tasted a fattened beast.” “The peak?” Concerned, she asked, “You don’t know where we’re going?” I drew a breath, uncertain how to answer.
 I would have been sure not to trust her, but she was traveling with us.
 It was probably best not to tell her, of all people, that I had no clue where I was or where I was going.

In my reptile brain I have also the memory of my friend Ricky Adams’ big brother having “folk” albums, some by a handsome, young, angular-faced singer named Bob Dylan, whose songs were meant as social anthems, wrong-righters.
 I didn’t know what to make of these threnodies.
 They were so stark, so naked.
 It was just a man’s voice, crying in the wilderness.
 This must have been shit, what?
 1962?
 Earlier?
 I can’t do a timeline, man, not even of my own life—some of it is such a blur.
 Is it like that for everyone?
 I have a memory of our family kitchen before school, oatmeal warming in a pan on the stove, my father dunking his folded toast into his coffee, and the plastic radio tuned to some “hits” station, probably WHBQ.

Marie always began the day with a walk in the garden, and Rick always hugged her and dried her tears when she returned.
 When he left for work, she'd exercise and watch movies he'd rented for her and clean the house with the supplies she'd discovered.
 In the evenings they'd eat and talk and watch TV, but he promised to take her to the shore Saturday.
 "The first thing we have to do is buy you a bathing suit," Rick told Marie as they strolled through the mall after dinner Friday evening.
 "Be prepared, OK?
 I think you'll find them a little immodest."
 She tried to prepare herself, but she was shocked by the outfits she was shown.
 The material was thin, and they all had plunging necklines, and some were cut so that the edge of the leg hole was almost as high as the arm hole.
 But she managed to find two, one red and one black with pink flowers, that were less shocking than the others and took them to the dressing room.
 These weren't going to work.

Aurelia stepped out from behind a tree, her cold, emotionless face so different from the previous day.
 “We have sparred our two weeks, Harruq,” she said.
 “You have no need to come here.”
 “Yeah, well, you heard what I said yesterday,” Harruq said, his face red.
 “What was that?”
 He kicked a rock.
 “It’s better to spar with another, remember?”
 Aurelia frowned.
 “You know I am a sorceress.
 My time should be spent studying my craft.

I mean, I could say I didn’t give a fuck what anyone thought, but you do when you’re becoming pubic, right.
 When your little dickie starts talking to you.
 So, I would do a knockoff of some song on the radio and the girls started following me around.
 And the first thing you know I’m getting handjobs in the girl’s bathroom.
 Cute girls, too, not just the trashy ones.
 The cheerleader types.
 I think my first blowjob was on the school playground, off in a corner, where there was this big bush.
 Cathy Ceccerelli.
 Man, she was hot, I mean for a thirteen year old.
 Great braids that hung on either side of her face.

My first year in college, I majored in philosophy.
 The second class opened with ancient Greeks.
 The professor set these philosophers’ arguments against each other.
 Next she used Roman arguments to refute the Greek who prevailed over the earlier Greeks.
 Then she applied the arguments of medieval scholastics to refute the Romans, and some arguments of Renaissance philosophers to refute the scholastics, and so on.
 At semester's end, she returned to the first Greek and, with his arguments, refuted a modern German.
 Philosophers argue and presume the best argument wins.
 But what if an idea we can't argue moves us so deeply we have to at least consider that it might be true though we could never argue why?
 The question prompted me to changed my major from philosophy to literature.
 Had I been less arrogant, I might've turned to theology instead, and perhaps become truly wise.

For a moment I couldn't think of anything other than how the dark blue of his shirt brought out his tan complexion.
 If his gorgeousness had stopped there, I probably would've been okay, but the little spirits in charge of keeping the universe in equilibrium must've been momentarily busy with something more important.
 The blue buttons that kept his shirt snuggly wrapped around his impressive torso were almost the exact shade of his eyes, which happened to be staring at me with a trace of something different than his normal self-assurance.
 In someone else I would've almost said gratitude, but his manner was too arrogant for that.
 More than anything else, that was what finally shook me from my reverie.
 He was already talking.
 "...wanted to talk to you about what happened today."
 Part of me wanted to wait and see what he was going to say, to lose myself in what was sure to be a very convincing lie designed to make him look good, and me feel like I was on heroin for however long he favored me with his presence.
 Luckily that idealistic, stupid part of me had seen too many girls get used by smooth-talking boys.
 I interrupted right away.

“Why do you use your hands, if you just think it, I mean?” He laughed.
 “That’s simply a quirk, I guess.
 Habit.
 Like when you’re playing flip ball and you want your piece to go in so bad you lean hard to ‘help’ it.” I remembered the game from when I’d first come to the village.
 The children would be bound from magic and have to throw an odd-shaped piece into the corresponding hole on a game board across from them.
 They would lean forward after they threw, sometimes bouncing and chanting, “Come on, come on,” twisting like somehow wishing would make the ball respond.
 The game had held no interest for me.
 I didn’t have to be bound to not have magic.
 It wasn’t a novelty, it was everyday life.
 “We should stop for breakfast,” Chevelle said.

Jim – Not to long now, he couldn’t hold out long under the pressure.
 Even pretending to be strait-laced was hard on Gene, he actually had to cut his hair and look ‘respectable’
 Art – Was I really that out of it during the divorce?
 Gene cut his hair and actually wore nice clothing.
 I think I would have noticed that Jimbo, are you trying to pull one on me?
 Jim  - This all actually happened, and you were out of it, you forgot to pay the bills for three months, and if you recall you wouldn’t take the time to eat unless either Gene, Liz or I brought you something and nagged till you finished it.
 Art – Ah yes, food the fuel for life.
 It doesn’t seem all that important to eat when your world is falling apart.
 How long did it take for Gene to finally snap?
 Jim  - He started spending a lot of time hanging out at their church doing bible lessons.

 Jim – Godzilla is just a guy in a dinosaur costume.

 It’ll work.
 It’s a well know fact that Godzilla is feared by millions of Japanese people.

But unlike a real dragon this one had three heads at the end of long serpentine necks; one was that of a wolf, one was of an eagle and one was of a lion.
 “What is it?” he asked Doi’van.
 “A Bunei.
 They are powerful fighters, but also lead packs of daemons in combat and have powerful magical abilities.
 Most of these others are powerful and dangerous, but a Bunei is more than a simple fighter of the Infernals.
 I am actually surprised to see they’re with the other beasts.
 I thought them a type of Greater Daemon.
 I think I might see what happens when I touch it,” Doi’van said.
 “Is that wise?” Rodregas asked.
 He was not challenging him.

After a few minutes she spoke, “The Gods and Daemon Lords are allowed to choose champions, but are not allowed to speak directly to any mortal.
 For this moment you are enough in the Celestial Realm for me to ask you a question: I don’t understand why you have chosen that.” As she spoke she raised her slim perfect arm and pointed at his shadow.
 He lowered his great head and studied the dark shape.
 The great lion had to admit the shadow was odd, slimmer than his great bulk, strangely dark in the day and the shadow’s eyes seem to glow the bright yellow color of flame.
 He shook his great head and mane as if to free it from the strange shadow, and growled, “You are a Goddess; you can see all.” Blodeuwedd nodded, she forgot to walk for a moment, as if in deep thought, but still she kept up with the Great Lion stalking through the grassland.
 “I can see all in our realm, and all in the mortal realm that is seen by one of our followers.
 I cannot see into the Infernal or Elemental Realms, and I think you have entered both.
 I do not know what this means.” The two continued through the grass for a few moments in silence.
 The Great Lion did not understand the Goddess’ questions or concerns.
 But he understood his own power, which in its way was as great as any god’s.

Like any good movie, this solution came too easily and too early in the drama.
 He was such a child then, easily influenced and dealing with challenges in counterproductive ways.
 He was caught being truant, being out past curfew, being with a kid who stole a wallet.
 He was involved in multiple car accidents.
 Brandon struggled and was barely making it through high school, so we changed him to a problem-child school to enable him to graduate.
 He and his younger brother Bryce were growing apart just as I had grown apart from my brother Thomas, which was torturous for me and Lisa to watch.
 Brandon dressed like some punk and believed he was the smartest person in the room.
 He became a very obnoxious person.
 At some point, we knew he was back into drugs, we just hoped he wasn’t getting himself addicted.
 We were kidding ourselves; we felt so powerless.

There was another ripple of movement on the other side of the light.
 Jasmin and Dom both pulled away from me, joining the other three, facing outward in preparation for the inevitable attack.
 Vincent's dark form inched slightly closer, but Brandon's growl froze his henchman in place.
 The complete stillness that resulted was suddenly shattered by a flash of heat lightning off to the east, and when the spots cleared from my vision, the two hybrids were a blur of motion.
 Merely human eyes never could've hoped to follow all of the action.
 I got the feeling Alec's technique was superior.
 He moved from spot to spot, motion to motion with the smooth economy of a tree bending before the wind, but if he was a tree, Brandon was the hurricane.
 Flare-light reflected off of deadly claws, and blood splattered the earth as Brandon drove Alec before him.
 Gashes appeared on both leaders, wetly glistening in the green light, but they were more numerous on Alec than on Brandon.
 I expected the unseen plane to mirror the fight I was so desperately trying to track with my inferior vision.

“Been working spells?” “Not on purpose.” He smiled.
 “Yes, spells can be dangerous.” “Yes,” I agreed, “but why do you need words for spells and not magic?” “A spell can be left, set with a trigger, or larger than your magic.
 They are complicated and wicked things.
 And the ancient language is… tricky.
 Definitely something you should stay away from.
 Years of learning and practice and you can still wreck a spell pretty good.” I thought about that for a moment.
 Steed jumped up.
 He held out a hand to me.
 “What do you say we water the horses?” I didn’t have to ask my horse to kneel; Steed just grabbed my waist and threw me up.
 He was mounted before I had settled into the saddle and our horses took off, galloping north in synchronization.

The half-orc batted the arrow away without thinking.
 “You bastard!” he shouted, slamming into the elf without pausing.
 He buried his swords deep into the elf’s chest as he plowed forward.
 “You hurt my brother!
 You spineless cowards!” The other two abandoned their bows and drew their blades.
 “Your brother is dead,” one elf said.
 “Gaelwren waited for your departure.
 He will not find it difficult killing a wounded dog.”
 The anger inside Harruq consumed him entirely.
 He charged the elf, abandoning any hint of precaution.

But she'd never have that again.
 When she'd chosen to return home, she'd given him up forever.
 She managed to hold herself together until she was in her room.
 Then she burst into tears.

It felt like a ribbon to me and I shrugged.
 I don't usually wear ribbons and bows; that was Emily's style.
 I pulled my hair back and tied the vine.
 It kept my hair out of my face and acted like a rubber band.
 “Thanks Emily,” I said.
 She finished tying her hair back.
 “No problem.
 We should look for somewhere to stay for the night.” I looked around, but everywhere was bare ground, hill after hill.
 “I don't see any caves.” “We'll just have to sleep in the open,” she stated and pointed to a huge tree.
 “We'll sleep under that tree.” “Okay,” I said, a little disappointed.

We have them sometimes to celebrate things."
 "Like what?"
 Brandon shook his head as he pulled me back down into my seat.
 "Nope, if you want to find out, you'll have to come to it with me."
 "You know, I don't usually leave conversations midway through.
 You really can let go of me."
 "Maybe, but I'm enjoying holding onto you."
 I forcefully removed his hand as I shook my head.
 "Boys.

Four hundred bodies of men and elves marched silently away from town, back toward their master.
 Qurrah smiled.

 We are close.
 So close.

The double doors leading to the private solar were also of Night Bronze, however the door was covered in intricate wards and symbols.
 The guardsmen's armor was less decorated and held only an engraving of their sigil animals.
 The guard on the right had an engraving on his Pauldrons, the piece of armor that protects his shoulders of the Celestial beast know as The Stag while the man on the left had an engraving of The Mastiff.
 After a moment, that seemed to stretch longer than was polite, the Immortal Guard to the right slowly nodded and with no hand touching it; the two massive doors opened to welcome him into the sanctum.
 Van’dret hurried through the open doors before the guard changed his mind.
 He normally found the sight of the Immortal Guards reassuring; the great sigil warriors were sworn to the protection of Immortalist, like himself, but he knew these two would cut him down like a common pauper if they sensed he was a danger to their Master.
 There was a short hallway leading from the doors with slim white columns on each side of the hallway, in between each column hung great pieces of art; paintings, sculptures and even a small wall hanging with amazing vibrant colors with a strange abstract design were all preserved in the space.
 Van’dret was a man of some refinement and appreciation for art, and he wished he had dared to stop and inspect the pieces; they had to be some of the greatest art works in the Realm to be so on display where only those who had been invited to a private meeting with Taiga would see them.
 However Van’dret dared to do nothing more than glance at them as he hurried forward.
 It would not be smart to make the Guild Dealer wait for even a moment.

The winner of two out of three rounds won the whole match.
 Rodregas’ opponent did not get up.
 He circled around and checked on the man.
 Rodregas could not tell if the man was alive or dead so he dismounted and took off the man’s helm.
 The man was covered in sweat and was surprisingly old.
 He was clearly alive, if unconscious.
 A few young squires ran out and helped to drag the man to get medical care.
 Rodregas’ next opponent followed in like manner, though he got up and gave Rodregas a second round.
 Rodregas circled around to Doi’van who held his spare shields and the provided lances.
 “This next one is wearing full plate armor, but it is steel.

 His eyes blazed.
 "Do you really mean that?"
 "Yes.

I pulled at her arm, but the effort was completely futile.
 Rising panic over not being able to breathe made me hammer at the iron bar pressing me against her, but she never looked away from whatever had captured her concentration.
 Rachel suddenly appeared off to my right, and she put her finger to her lips, and then sank all ten fingernails into Dominic's arm.
 The sudden absence of the support I'd been unconsciously using to keep weight off of my right foot resulted in tear-jerking pain as the damaged appendage touched down, but I gritted my teeth and managed to keep it down to a hiss.
 Rachel draped my arm over her shoulders, and then dragged me forward a couple of awkward, hopping steps.
 A couple of heartbeats passed before I realized the pool of shadow before us was Jessica.
 She had her eyes closed and was rocking back and forth as Rachel carefully pulled her to us.
 I mirrored Rachel's actions, wrapping my free arm around Jess as I whipped my head back and forth in an effort to figure out what was going on.
 We were pressed up against one corner of the pavilion, with what I assumed was the rest of the pack between us and everyone else.
 For a moment the wall of bodies precluded figuring out what was going on, but then Isaac shifted slightly to the left, and I saw Brandon and Vincent through the gap.

Who'd be interested in helping us?
 No, that wasn't the right question.
 The key to figuring this all out was to decide who could've helped us out.
 Nobody we'd known back in Minnesota could've strong-armed both the president of a bank and the mayor.
 Especially not from all the way back there.
 It had to be someone local, and they had to be either rich, powerful, or both.
 The answer was so obvious I felt like an idiot for not realizing who it was from the start.
 Who had I been told, almost from my first day here, were the two most influential families in Sanctuary?
 The Worthingfields and the Graveses.
 Both of which had at least one member of the family my age, one of whom seemed to hate me profoundly.

A few seconds later, it was as if nothing had ever happened.
 The ring of spectators dissolved as kids quickly returned to their tables.
 Brandon and his friends left through one set of cafeteria doors, while Alec and his friends departed through the other.
 Britney looked like she was trying to decide whether to be mad or impressed, but I felt too sick to stick around and try to nudge her in either direction.
 I mumbled something I hoped sounded intelligible and headed towards the bathroom.
 I passed Mr. Simms and another teacher on my way out, but apparently I looked as awful as I felt.
 They just shot me stern looks rather than stopping me to ask what had happened.
 It wasn't until I'd finished dry-heaving and was trying to clean myself back up, that I wondered where they'd been.
 The school building wasn't that big.
 If they'd really been trying to break up the fight, they should have arrived minutes earlier.

 He laughed.

 "Well, there are still movies and lovers and excitement, but I wouldn't call it romantic."
 "Why not?"
 "Everyone takes drugs and gets drunk and has affairs."

This was reverence.
 Anvil smiled.
 A movement at the tree line caught everyone’s attention, and I turned to find Chevelle’s onetime guest, Asher.
 He stood in the shadows, staff in hand, as if allowing us to see.
 The air was still as he inclined his head toward Chevelle and then turned, a long, dark braid whipping behind him as he disappeared into the brush.
 This seemed to mean something to the group, something like relief.
 I stared after him, but Anvil stepped forward, thumping his balled fist against his chest in a gesture I didn’t understand.
 Grey followed, repeating the action and adding a single nod, and Ruby clasped her hands, bouncing excitedly from heel to toe.
 I felt myself drawing back together, tied by the knots in my stomach and mind.
 A tandem wolf howl sounded in the distance.

 What was it like, physically for you, and how did that relate to the creative outburst in your music?
 BG:  	Well, I think they’re the same thing, right?
 I mean, coming into humanity, opening the door that we all have to open, and then making something of your feelings, your flow, well, that’s what was going on with me at 14.
 And Debbie, well, she was just so young and lovely.
 The first time she took my cock out was in her backyard, leaning against her house, her mother moving around in the kitchen right over our heads—this is what you did back then.

Its wide body started to swell, sides bubbling out, puffing it into a tiny green balloon.
 It did not transform into that monarch butterfly I had imagined.
 It burst, spewing entrails across the hem of my dress.
 My head fell into my hands as I groaned.
 It took a while, but the anger eventually faded to a point where I realized I’d need a new plan.
 I couldn’t help but regret the flames had consumed the documents that had caused all this to begin with.
 I should have fully read them first.
 My heart tripped at the sound of cracking tinder beneath boot across the clearing.
 The fire had burned out, but the ashes were plenty evidence I’d been here.
 I ducked under the cover of a large spruce and watched.

I knew the way pot smelled, so it wasn’t any great detective work that led me to it.
 Soon after this, we discovered he had obtained a license to obtain medical marijuana.
 I was surprised.
 Turns out, it’s legal for my child (and yours) to buy, possess and grow pot and the only requirement is that they want it!
 Any little shithead can get a “medical” license to smoke marijuana in California when he turns 18.
 In fact, it’s a rite of passage, even more than a drivers’ license nowadays.
 The students hand around a list of unscrupulous doctors who are willing to do a consultation for a fee and then write a prescription for a fee so your child can go to some legal dope dispensary and buy all the “sticky-icky green bud” he or she wants.
 They don’t need a parent to sign, they just need to recite from a passed-around list of symptoms as to why they need this marijuana when they show up to this farce of a doctor’s appointment.
 Apparently half of the high school has obtained this license to smoke pot and can buy the strongest pot available, legally.
 I went and got one for myself—as an experiment—and was astonished at how easy it was.

Alec was silent for so long I finally tore my gaze from his masterpiece long enough to find that he was staring at me with surprise.
 "It's you, Adri.
 Of course it's beautiful."
 For a second I couldn't breathe.
 It seemed so utterly impossible.
 Maybe it could've been a painting of Cindi, but not one of me.
 I couldn't possibly be the gorgeous figure he'd brought to life on his canvas.
 I opened my mouth to protest, and then the expression on her face finally registered for me.
 Compassion.
 Acceptance of the viewer, combined with an obvious desire to mend grievous hurts.

In this way the foreign currency and gold reserves were used as a buffer to moderate contraction of the money supply and avoid the shock usually accompanying such efforts.
 Issuing of the old dinar was stopped, but it remained in circulation as legal tender.
 An interest rate of six per cent was established for the superdinar - the first real, positive interest rate in years - to make holding the new currency an attractive alternative to hoarding goods or foreign exchange.
 It had been widely anticipated by foreign experts that this strategy would result in an immediate run on the country's foreign reserves and thereby a collapse of the new currency's foundation.
 Contrary to expectations, the initial months of the programme have yielded spectacular results.
 Inflation fell to zero per cent in the first week after the issue of the new currency and remained below one per cent during the first five months.
 Instead of a massive outflow of foreign currency through conversion of superdinars, people have rushed to cash in their foreign currency, resulting in a 60 per cent increase in the nation's reserves during the first three months.
 One of the most significant features of the programme has been its fair distribution of benefits and low social cost to the population.
 In contrast with the widespread outrage felt by Russian citizens over repeated episodes of demonetization and confiscation of household savings, the Yugoslav people have enthusiastically accepted the new currency as representative of a new deal for the poor and the working class.
 In addition, instead of the severe contraction of output experienced elsewhere, production rose by more than 100 per cent during the first five months, stimulating an increase in employment and demand for new investment.

The dobro is holy.
 I have a teacher, a guy out here, you’ve never heard of him—he’s done some studio stuff, but mostly he just plays for himself and his students.
 He lives up in the hills, inherited money from, what was it, adding machines or some office supply.
 He’s an office supply heir.
 Anyway, he’s teaching me dobro.
 It’s a discipline, like any other.
 I love the dobro but, never, never would I claim to be master of it.

Marie tried to smile, but the thought of that wedding gown, that symbol of tradition and family and home, upset her.
 Yesterday it had made her long for home.
 Now it made her long for Rick.
 She wanted to wear it for him.
 She certainly wasn't going to wear it for Davis.
 After breakfast Mr. Tranton went to call his daughter’s betrothed.
 Marie was in the living room with her mother and brother, and they jumped when they heard him begin shouting.
 They'd had only enough time to look at each other in bewilderment when Mr. Tranton joined them.
 "Young Runyon will be here within the hour."
 Understanding dawned, and Marie said quietly, "He didn't want to come until after work, did he?"

Despisers of life are they, decaying and poisoned themselves, of whom the earth is weary: so let them go!"
 A rumbling commenced.
 At first I thought it was a landslide.
 A granite stone about three feet across came bounding and crashing toward us, gathering speed as it careened.
 We scrambled off the boulder and into the shelter of a grotto beside the trickling stream.
 Once we caught our breath, we crawled and peeked out from behind the rocks that formed the grotto’s walls.
 On the hillside, Tom stood waving our crowbar, bellowing laughter and prying loose another big stone.
 We tugged on our jeans and shoes while he rolled more stores and slung smaller rocks at us.
 The way his legs slashed and arms whirled, he looked like some rabid demon.
 Four of us split off, two up the canyon, two down.

Rodregas spoke carefully so as not to tip the sword and said, “It is called sword meditation.
 My instructor would start us out with the prayer and then we would meditative on our duty.” “For how long?” asked Imeralda.
 “Until you are sure of what your duty is,” Rodregas replied, hearing the voice of his old drill Knight Captain.
 All the instructors had been retired knights who enjoyed teaching the squires.
 He did not think the two would join him for this but both pulled their weapons and imitated his position, Doi’van with his large great sword balanced on his powerful arms, Imeralda grabbed her bow instead of a short sword, which with her lack of training was probably a good idea.
 Rodregas focused inwards and resumed his meditation.
 He was finding it wonderful to do the meditation again; Rodregas had a lot of good memories from his life as a squire, before everything had gone wrong.
 Part of him felt uncomfortable for doing this again, like he no longer had the right.
 But once you are raised from Page to Squire as he had been, you always got to keep the title of Squire.
 Squires who were not raised to knighthood were much sought after; their martial training and their education, especially in law and etiquette, were a great foundation for many careers.

And I did, too.
 And I sang it again.
 It was just heart wrenching, man, I mean, we were just like two kids given a new lease on life.
 I wrote a song, I kept, thinking.
 I wrote a damn good song.
 I was back, you know, back, but different.
 Different but the same.
 This is what I want everyone to understand.
 What I want to say—the difference is not a drama, the difference is a poem, a song, a way of looking at life, that’s slightly atilt, slightly askew, perhaps, but it’s all me, you know?
 It’s what I am.

Each had been terrifying, but none as vivid as the first.
 Bad dreams had become a frequent companion since the accident.
 It'd become nearly passé to wake up emotionally exhausted from what should have been a restful night, but these dreams had been different.
 I'd played out nearly every possible combination of events since the accident.
 Dreams where I was the one driving instead of Cindi.
 Dreams where I got a ride home with someone so Dad and Cindi didn't have any reason to be on the road.
 Dreams where I was in the truck that killed them, even dreams where I was in the back seat as a passenger at the moment of impact.
 I was used to awaking shaking and scared countless times during the course of a night, but I'd never felt that level of pure, bestial fear.
 I stumbled into the bathroom and flipped on the light, only to groan at how ghastly I looked.
 I was even paler than normal, with dark circles under my eyes that only a crack addict could possibly find attractive.

The interests of global peace, political stability and basic human rights justify and may necessitate external assistance to help countries establish viable food security systems.
 In countries that are unable either to produce sufficient food or to initiate coordinated programmes to overcome present deficits, the international development force proposed earlier in this report can act in a trusteeship role to assist in designing and implementing integrated programmes to upgrade food production and distribution.
 UNDP can undertake the role of coordinating the activities of all UN agencies in this effort.
 Emphasis should be placed on sustainable production and distribution – not just relief operations – through the introduction of effective systems for planning, administration, education, demonstration and implementation.
 4.Model districts.
 The potential benefits of applying a resource-based, location-specific approach to agriculture can best be demonstrated by the establishment of model programmes in different agro-climatic regions.
 The models should be large enough geographically to serve as a viable index of national-level potentials and of economic and ecological sustainability.
 Although the concept may vary from place to place, the central approach is to examine in detail the current usage of both land and water resources and then formulate a district level plan for utilizing available physical, technological, human, managerial and financial resources in a sustainable manner to optimize, over time, production, productivity, farm incomes and employment, non-farm occupations, self-employment opportunities, agro-industrial development, exports and expansion of the service sector.
 This analysis is likely to identify a wide gap between present and potential achievements, which can form the basis for creating an alternative district development plan.
 Government can seek the assistance of farmers' organizations, private enter prise, educational and research institutes, and voluntary agencies for gathering information, analysis and plan formulation.

Marie stared at him, her eyes widening in disbelief.
 "Rick?
 Are you-are you crying?"
 Not giving him time to respond, she threw her arms around him.
 "I'm sorry."
 She covered his face with kisses.
 "I love you, Rick.
 I love you so much.
 I don't want to hurt you."
 His arms whipped around her.

“I get restless stuck in here,” he said.
 He dropped his weapons in the corner, shed much of his leather armor, and then released a loud groan as he settled down.
 “Harruq, I must ask a favor of you,” Qurrah said.
 He sat next to his brother.
 “Sure thing,” Harruq said.
 “What you need?”
 Qurrah fiddled with the bones in his pouch.
 “There is someone I need you to meet.”
 Harruq raised an eyebrow.
 “The person you’ve been sneaking off to each night?” he asked.

Good-bye, Davis."
 She stuffed the ring in his shirt pocket and marched off.
 All three people in the living room stopped talking and looked up when she returned to the living room.
 "Did you end your betrothal?"
 Mr. Tranton asked, standing.
 "Yes.
 I'm sorry, Father.
 I know that Davis--" "Don't be sorry.
 I just want you to be happy, darling."
 Marie was too stunned for a moment to move.

I turned and started into a shuffling run.
 Maybe the wolf would be attracted to the noise and light.
 Maybe I'd be able to get far enough away it wouldn't smell me.
 I'd only been moving for about a minute before another howl sent chills running down my spine.
 It sounded like a different wolf, and it was closer than the first one.
 I tried to run faster, but all that time studiously avoiding exercise was working against me.
 I topped a slight rise and then tripped as the ground wasn't where I expected it to be.
 My jacket saved me from picking up any really serious scrapes this time, but just before I finished tumbling to a stop I slammed my head into a crescent-shaped rock.
 My vision swam in and out of focus, but I struggled to my feet, only to nearly fall again as my right ankle all but collapsed under me.
 They were definitely closer now.

Much of their work can come to fruition in the changed international climate, if only we shift the emphasis from preoccupation with cataloguing the problems to focusing on the opportunities available to eliminate them.
 The work of an independent, self-constituted commission has the advantage of being unfettered by the necessity of conforming to any official policy lines.
 It is also faced with the challenge of making a real further contribution on issues which engage so many excellent minds and institutions world wide.
 In formulating the ideas and recommendations incorporated in this report, it has been our objective to avoid utopian and idealistic prescriptions that are incapable of being translated into practice in the foreseeable future.
 At the same time, we have refused to be confined by what is presently considered realistic and practicable, because both intuition and recent experience confirm that our conception of what is real and achievable are themselves often the expression of limited and short-sighted perceptions.
 Disclaimer
 Due to the diversity and complexity of the views examined by the Commission, and the heterogeneous mix of Commission members drawn from a wide range of countries, backgrounds and professions, it has not been possible to arrive at consensus on all the views discussed in this report.
 Five years of research and discussion have created a much greater commonality of perspective, but there are still significant differences among members regarding specific views and recommendations presented in this report.
 However, all the Commissioners agree with the basic emphasis on social and gender equity, job-led growth and human security.
 Members share the conviction that a candid and challenging discussion of these issues is more valuable than representation of a consensus view.

It seemed they were planning, but I couldn’t be sure.
 There was movement again in the shadows as more figures approached.
 I inched forward, anticipating when they would come into view.
 One of the forms was a mass, low to the ground.
 I squinted to see better and— I almost screamed as a hand wrapped around my biceps with fierce strength, jerking me to my feet.
 I tried to see my attacker, to think of the magic to protect myself.
 “What are you doing?” It would have been a yell it if wasn’t hissed.
 The tone was harsh and I recognized it at once.
 “Oh,” I managed.
 Part of me was saying calm down, but the other was screaming I was still in danger.

 Even though we had not planned to start a family so early, we were thrilled, excited and anxious at the thought of creating a life conceived by the two of us.

Without sufficient purchasing power for food and other material essentials and non-essentials, there can be no assurances of lasting social peace and political stability.
 The linkage between peace, political stability and economic development will be even stronger in the future than in the past, due to the democratic and social revolutions that are in the course of encompassing the globe.
 The greater access to information and freedom of expression which characterize democratic societies and the rising expectations of people at lower economic levels combine to generate a powerful pressure on society to provide economic opportunities as well as social freedoms to every citizen.
 If the greater freedom and higher expectations are unable to find means for their positive fulfilment, they can lead to rising frustration, tension and violence, which threaten the prosperity of those at higher levels and the stability of the society as a whole.
 Democracies can only thrive and the revolution of rising expectations can only fulfil itself peacefully, when economic opportunities are provided to every human being.
 The recent rise of the political right, ethnic unrest and opposition to immigration in Western Europe, and the surge of crime in the United States, are sufficient evidence of the corrosive impact that unemployment can have, even on mature democracies.
 Increasingly, those excluded from the benefits of modern society reject its standards of justice and ignore its laws.
 The end of the ideological confrontation between capitalism and communism leaves the market system exposed at its weakest point – its impersonality and insensitivity to human needs and suffering – with no longer any lesser alternative to point at in self-justification.
 Having rejected the inadequacies and abuses of authoritarian socialism as a solution, we are compelled to find other methods to achieve social equity.
 In the present context, employment is the most effective way to distribute the fruits of development among people.

Sylvia’s challenge sent me to 1 John 4:8.
 "Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love."
 I needed to know more about love.
 I was single after seventeen years married.
 My two kids, both in their teens, were awfully troubled.
 And God seemed too far away.
 I decided to read all I could find on the subject of love.
 I read C.S.
 Lewis, Erich Fromm, Thomas Merton, and a dozen or so other books I came across or got led to, even the Kama Sutra.
 Then, supposing I knew as much about love as I ever would, I turned to reading mystery novels, since writing them had become my occupation.

Luckily for Rodregas, there was a turn off almost immediately that let him circle around the edge of town and then start heading out of the valley.
 He went north toward the town of Cruet.
 As dusk was falling there was little traffic.
 Luckily this part of the road was well cleared and open and the horses were fresh so he made headway even as it became dark.
 He pushed hard until he reached the fork that headed west up into the hills.
 It was seldom traveled by anyone except fur trappers.
 Rodregas pushed on through the night and into the sunrise of the next day until even the horse that had been Korin’s ride, which he had tied to the back of the wagon, seemed to be tired and ready for rest.
 He stopped and let the animals take a break next to a small creek.
 Rodregas was not sure what would happen when the relief guards went to the tower and found the other guards tied up, apparently by Ravenhurr himself.
 His assistant had been killed in the Master’s own room.

Tears ran down his cheeks.
 The thought was too painful to bear.
 Around 1:00 he dragged himself upstairs, even though he knew he'd be unable to sleep.
 He took three Advil and lay down, throwing his arm over his eyes.
 He dozed fitfully, finally coming wide awake just after 6:00.
 He wished he could sleep.
 Sleep would be an escape.
 He couldn't bear the images that had come on the heels of his newest realization--images of Marie surrounded by children, making dinner for them, for a husband, kissing him, making love with him .

Alec apparently hadn't gotten the memo.
 He was in an honest-to-goodness full tux.
 I wasn't the only one stunned by how good he looked; there was a ripple of turned heads as people noticed his entrance.
 He paced the short distance down to the back row of seats with such incredible grace that I felt my mouth go dry.
 No one person should be so attractive, not when there wasn't enough of him to go around to every single woman in the world.
 For a few seconds I forgot all about the reasons I didn't like him, and just wished he was sitting in front of me instead of two rows behind me where I couldn't see him.
 Then I realized what his arrival really meant.
 Rachel had stood me up.
 She wasn't on the bus, and she apparently hadn't come with her brother, so she wasn't coming.
 I knew I should reserve judgment until I'd given her a chance to explain what'd happened, but it was hard to remember that when faced with Alec's air of superiority.

He felt exhilarated.
 Even though the orc pressed with all his strength, he could not force the kill.
 At last, Harruq forced him back, and in the brief opening he spun his sword around and buried half the blade into the orc’s gut.
 The orc gasped something unintelligible, dropped his other sword, and fell limp.
 Harruq stared at the body, his hands shaking from the excitement and his breath thunderous in his ears.
 A hand touched his shoulder.
 He recoiled as if struck.
 “Well done,” Qurrah said, his eyes locked on the corpse.
 Harruq recognized that look.
 His brother had seen something he wanted, and he would have it.

The wind picked up around me, as if a wind current had just appeared out of nowhere.
 5… My body started to feel hot, like I was being hugged by the sun.
 I hated this part.
 4… Power surged through me as I was freed from my human self.
 Shivers ran down my spine.
 3… I felt cold, like being dipped in ice water.
 The breeze picked up even harder.
 2… I was hollow and could probably see my own body if I opened my eyes.
 But I could never get the courage to do that.
 1… The wind died.

It's like, oh, I don't know, I think maybe learning about the past will help me understand what's going on right now."
 Mallory's sigh seemed to allude to every one of her presumably substantial years.
 "How very perceptive.
 The past is very much driving what's happening right now, but so much of the past is tied up with the very things from which Alec's trying to protect you."
 I was bubbling with questions, but sensing that now wasn't the time to push, I sat back and waited in silence while she decided exactly how much to tell me.
 "Alec's father was killed nearly two decades ago.
 I don't remember everything about that night, I wasn't even conscious for a large part of the happenings, but the pieces I do remember are sharper than they should be.
 Sharper in my mind now maybe than even when they happened."
 Her hand gripped mine with a fragile strength that hinted at the vibrant, powerful woman she'd been back then.
 Back before the years had worn at her.

We went out to dinner, went to parties, sometimes just sat quietly reading together.
 But best of all, we would walk or sit on the beach for hours talking.

 She paused, smiling as she reached out to touch a lock of Marie's hair.
 "Every time we kissed, I felt it all over."
 Marie's eyes flew to her mother's.
 "Why didn't you marry him?"
 Mrs. Tranton's face sobered.
 "He died.
 He drowned trying to save his little cousin."

 _Qurrah asked as he crept up the hill toward the dark man as if approaching a god._
 You know the words.
 Can I trust you?

“Cheep, cheep, cheep.” My teeth gritted, but I could not block out the irritating sound.
 It broke into a melody that pierced my ears and I barely restrained the growl of frustration as I cursed the devil thing.
 That was when I heard the hollow thud of its body smacking the floor.
 I jerked upright.
 My ears were still ringing from the harsh song, but the bird lay dead on the wood planks below the window.
 Chevelle started to turn to find the source of the muffled thump and, before I realized what I was doing, I flicked my right hand and the bird’s body flopped behind a shelf out of sight.
 When Chevelle turned back to me, I stared right into his eyes as if I had not seen or heard a thing, wondering why he wasn’t still explaining the histories of Grah.
 He glanced past me… or maybe at the crown of my head.
 Like he was avoiding my eyes.
 My lying eyes.

I could only think of one thing: Fight fire with fire.
 I flung my arm toward the incoming stream of flames and a tongue of fire akin to a dragon’s shot out and collided with it.
 I was shocked.
 I’d only used my power to light candles and lanterns.
 I’d had no idea I could produce such a vicious plume of flames.
 I looked to Chevelle.
 “Yes,” he exalted.
 He raised his arms above his head to construct a massive circle of blazing heat.
 When his eyes returned to mine, he smiled.
 He liked playing with fire.

"Guys!
 Did you see the back door?"
 I could almost see the wheels turning in Britney's head.
 First she went red as she remembered she'd stranded me at school, then her eyes got a little wider as she realized it was still about five minutes too early for me to have arrived on the bus.
 Brandon's normal smile was back.
 "Yeah, Adriana noticed it almost as soon as we pulled up to the school."
 Her suspicions that Brandon had given me a ride into school satisfied, Britney managed a sickly smile and mumbled something about seeing us later as she disappeared around the corner.
 I managed to make it another twenty feet before I couldn't restrain my laughter anymore.
 Brandon joined in with a chuckle that was more restrained, but no less heartfelt.
 We both wound down about the same time, and I wiped a tear off of the corner of each eye.

Qurrah approached through the trees, clutching a worn bag in his long fingers.
 His brown eyes glanced over the dead boy.
 He nodded in approval.
 “Well done,” Qurrah said.
 “Killing kids is hardly worth a well done.”
 Qurrah frowned as he glanced from his prize to his brother, who sat against a tree, arms on his knees.
 “Take pride in all you do,” Qurrah said.
 “Only then will you improve.”
 Harruq shrugged.
 “You need me?”

I was confused and didn't have a chance to talk to my mother about it.
 I needed to and was going to, after I'd walked through the garden and thought about it and it was time for her to be awake .

 but instead I walked into your garden, into 2011."
 The tears began flowing faster down her cheeks.
 "But I don't belong here.
 It’s as if-as if I’ve been abducted from my home and put in prison.
 A beautiful prison, yes--but still a place where I'm trapped."
 Rick stared at her, his throat thick and sore.

The tingling was even more intense now as I brought my hand up and cupped the side of his face, and then our lips met.
 It wasn't like I'd imagined.
 His lips were warm, and they had the slightest hint of softness, but there was more urgency and fierceness to the kiss than expected.
 It wasn't as amazing as I'd fantasized, but I was still having a hard time thinking.
 I tried to pull back and catch my breath, but his arms had become steel cables that pulled me in tighter.
 Fear finally overcoming my desire not to look stupid.
 I started to push away from Brandon.
 My efforts seemed futile for several seconds, and then his right arm released me.
 He wasn't letting me go though, his right hand had just repositioned to my stomach while his left arm kept me pinned against him almost as tightly as both hands had just a second before.
 It should have been obvious what he had in mind, but it wasn't until his hand was under my shirt and moving upwards that my overloaded mind caught up with events.

Eugene – I’m going to test out my new name.
 There’s gotta be a few Japanese tourists somewhere around town.
 I am GODZILLA!
 (Walks off stage)
 Liz – He’s not going to get himself hurt is he?
 Jim – Hard to say, this has got to be more harmless than some of the other things he was doing though.
 Most likely he’ll just get chased off by some angry tourists.
 Liz – What’s he done that is worse than this?
 And what did he mean when he said ‘you’re good at this sort of thing.’
 Jim – He didn’t mean anything by it.

The walls were stark white, like carved marble, and the room felt cold and empty, despite the abundance inside.
 I found a shelf to hide behind and placed my pilfered documents on the floor.
 I examined the shelves in front of me, looking for a match to the symbols, and found the sections to be arranged by groups, each shelf divided by categories within.
 I walked the library in search of the section marked for either of the characters listed on my documents, and was about to give up when I noticed some encased racks in the center of the room.
 I checked the small section, seeing immediately the symbols fit.
 I smiled, thinking how easy it had been as I slid my fingertips across the volumes on that shelf.
 My fingers tingled as they crossed a thin section of pages bound together.
 I slid them out just as I became aware of some sort of commotion… that sounded like it was getting closer.
 No, not a tingle indicating what I was looking for.
 It was a protection spell.

Jim – I’ve noticed that he’s been in a worse mood than normal, but what do you want me to do about it?
 He doesn’t like me any more than he likes the rest of the world.
 I can’t think of anything I can really do for him.
 Art – Maybe not, maybe not.
 He may hate us all for all eternity, but I’m going to try anyway.
 I can’t just let him waste away like this.
 I’ll do my best by him.
 That is about all I can offer him.
 It’s all I could ever offer him, and it was never enough, your mother saw to that.
 I failed him as a father so far.

Unemployment is of growing concern today primarily because population has expanded in recent decades even faster than job creation and because a larger percentage of the population, principally women, seek employment now than at any time in the past.
 The shortages of jobs and the resulting poverty represent the most pressing social problem in the world today.
 But viewed in historical perspective, it is clear that substantial progress has been made during the post-war period, making humanity as a whole more prosperous than at any previous period in recorded history.
 Over the past five decades, global GDP has multiplied seven-fold.
 In spite of unprecedented population growth, per capita income has more than tripled.
 Between 1965 and 1985, real per capita consumption in the developing world rose by 70 per cent.
 Despite the paramount concern raised by the persis tence of high rates of unemployment in recent years, available data do not confirm a long-term trend towards rising rates of global unemployment.
 Prognosis for Employment in the Twenty-First Century
 Although it is difficult to make reliable employment projections based on past trends, we can say some things with a fair degree of certainty.
 In order to provide employment for every job seeker, the world needs to create approximately one billion new jobs during the next decade.

I find myself less interested in their chat as I mentally prepare myself for the task at hand.
 I am given the weapons and shots fired instructions again.
 In my usual humorous deflection of discomfort, I quip that the last time I met Ashley it was a “happy ending” and I would like the same result this time.
 The officers are un-amused.
 The officers are sent to stake out a nearby drugstore.
 My story to the drug dealers will be that I will fill the prescription there and meet her in that parking lot as it is a stone’s throw within the county line which they want the bust in.
 One problem I point out is that the drugstore will be closed in a few minutes but they send the crew that direction for feedback on the location.
 The call comes back and the parking lot is virtually empty of cars leaving no cover for the officers to hide.
 I am starting to feel like I know more about this drug busting business than the cops.
 After a change of venue to a nearby grocery store down the street and several miles within the county line, it is nearly 9 pm and I have been unable to call my wife for over three hours.

He broke up Black Lung, not Lorelei, not me.
 The minute that raincloud in a suit walked into our studio—our fucking studio, where we made magic, man, where it all happened—the minute he walked in, in his appropriate sharkskin suit, we were fucked.
 Crafty brought him in, of course.
 He was Kim’s father, as you know.
 Crafty’s fiancé, since wife, since ex-wife.
 Kim was alright—you know, she had that mane of golden-white hair, she was beautiful, goddamn beautiful.
 We all wanted her.
 That’s ok to say, Lor?
 We all wanted her because, hell, she had that skin, you know, translucent and freckled and white like yonder waning moon.
 But, she was Crafty’s, sort of.

He threw the vial.
 It shattered.
 Velixar snarled as holy light of the elven goddess burned his decaying flesh.
 After a few seconds, the light vanished.
 Velixar glanced about, seeing no sign of the elf.
 “No matter,” he said.
 “Come my minions.
 It is time to hunt.”
 He spread his hands wide and let all of his power flow freely.
 A swirling black portal ripped into existence behind him, a bleak wind wailing from it.

The increasing destructiveness of violent conflict to society in general has resulted in a shift in military strategy from actual fighting to preventive diplomacy.
 The Helsinki Process, the Stockholm Document, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Warsaw Treaty’s adoption of the doctrine of ‘non-offensive defence’, and most recently the UN Secretary General’s Agenda for Peace – all give highest priority to war prevention.
 While welcome, these incremental measures do not fully recognize either the extent of the danger of the continued application of violence to achieve political ends or the extent of the opportunity which the end of the Cold War has brought for radically altering the way in which humanity settles domestic and international disputes.
 There was a time when war could be justified as a necessary expedient.
 Now the potential human and economic costs of even limited terrorist war – especially if it involves the use of nuclear or biological weapons, but even otherwise – are so great that the risks are no longer tolerable.
 Because the potential risks far outweigh the possible advantages of continued reliance on this means of achieving national and international security, war has become obsolete as an instrument of policy.
 At the same time, there is no longer an insurmountable political conflict within the UN system to prevent all member countries from agreeing to a total ban on the use of violence against each other.
 It is time for the UN to declare war itself a crime against humanity and to ban from membership any nation that engages in aggression against another.
 Even if this intention cannot immediately be made effective, the adoption of this Peace Imperative would mark a milestone in human affairs.
 There is no rational or practical obstacle to the immediate adoption of this measure.

“A… a… choo!” she wheezed.
 Elves didn’t sneeze.
 Fairies sneezed.
 Forest creatures sneezed.
 Not elves.
 I couldn’t help it.
 I giggled.
 Evelyn shot a glower at me.
 And then she whirled, storming away, and as she glanced back, her parting expression was so priceless I wished I could see it again.
 “Achoo!” “Choo!” “Hachoo!” My ears popped as I burst out with laughter.

 Jim – I don’t think it would apply to our situation?
 Liz – Why not?
 Jim – It just wouldn’t
 Liz – What would he do?
 Jim – Sumo Assassin would race to the courthouse on the Sumo-mobile crash it through the walls and then Aunt Jeihmima the judge, backing over him once or twice to make sure that the judge would stay down.
 That would only happen after Eugene’s father received the same treatment.

So, am I stronger, faster or what?” Doi’van asked.
 Imeralda shrugged and said, “No.
 You are more, well, I think the only way to describe it is more nymph-like.
 There are tales of eating the blessings of the One Tree, most of the greatest Nymphs of our history all claim this.
 A Forest Nymph simply becomes more connected to the forest, and some also claim to gain more than one elemental power.
 There are only a few stories of those people who have been adopted as Nymphs who have earned the blessing, but I have no idea what effect it will have,” she said.
 With a shrug she added, “But I do not think it will help much on the battlefield.” Rodregas nodded.
 It might have little practical effect, but he knew that while a greater sigil might make him a great fighter and that while fighting was necessary, it had no real inherent value.
 It simply made one better at fighting.
 Somehow he knew the blessing was inherently a positive thing.

 Art – Then I’ll finally have proof that you were dropped on your head as a baby.
 Jim – You mean you need more proof than my miss-shapen head?
 Art – That would most likely be genetic.
 Both your mother and I are reasonably smart individuals, as were our parents.
 If you’re dumb, well then your head must have been tampered with after you were removed from the packaging.
 Jim – Always possible, though I think if anything is wrong it’s because of designer flaws.
 Well, shall we get going ‘O’ he who understands women?
 Art – Listen and learn.
 First of all, I don’t understand women, nobody does, some of the time I feel that they don’t even understand themselves.

I shook my head violently.
 "No, you don't have anything to be sorry about.
 It...well, it was all so horrid.
 I can't imagine how hard it must be for you."
 Rachel stopped me before I could say anything else.
 "It's pretty rough, but not for the reasons you think.
 Mom isn't entirely healthy.
 Hasn't been since our father was killed.
 It isn't really her fault she behaves the way she does.

Yet he'd stopped.
 But he couldn't regret that decision.
 She'd probably let him make love to her, but she'd be devastated when it was over.
 Her morals were deeply ingrained, and the guilt would eat away at her.
 He loved her far too much to put her through that.
 But they couldn't go on like this.
 He'd always prided himself on his self-control, but living under the same roof with a woman he loved, a woman who begged for his kisses--that was too much.
 But he knew Marie didn't really understand.
 She thought that they could just kiss forever.
 If only he could convince her to stay here with him.

“Hi guys,” Seth said still fighting a smirk.
 “Hi,” I replied cautiously.
 “What are you guys hiding?” Jason’s face twisted up and a snort of laughter fought its way out of his nose.
 “Nothing.” “Right…” Emily gave me a look that said, is this good or bad?
 I didn’t really have an answer for her but I knew that whatever was coming, it wasn’t going to be good.
 “So Jason, we have a question for you.” I nodded towards Emily.
 Jason’s face grinned in a seriously weird way that screamed, ‘weirdo!’ He shifted his hands and said, “What?” Emily stepped forward, “We want to know what you’re…” but she never finished.
 She had triggered it all.
 Jason had been hiding two blue, full, water pistols behind his back and was now shooting them at Emily’s face.
 She was holding up her hands and letting out some sort of squeal.

It is this: we are not cynical.
 We do not deny our left arms, our spiritual sides.
 I mean, the universe is vast and mysterious and difficult and harmful and loving and full of the kind of wonder that makes simple men sit on their porches at night and look at the stars.
 I believe this: there is more star-gazer to most of us than cynic.
 But I’m still left with an uneasy feeling about spirituality, religion, personal theism, ibada, vespers—call it what you will—entering our workaday lives.
 I’m not sure I want it there, in the marketplace, in the bars, in the music.
 Perhaps, dad, it should all remain private.
 And maybe all this religiosity can be refuted by Hemingway’s wonderful closing line to The Sun Also Rises, “Isn’t it pretty to think so?”  But here, in middle age, with my old friends settling down, with children growing up around me like burning bushes, I say to Papa: Yes, it is.
 It is pretty to think there are things we don’t understand.
 CM:  	We’re nearing the end here.

If not, let's get some bigger ones."
 "No--these are the small ones.
 I'll go try the others."
 They bought the bigger pair and two shirts, and Marie wore the jeans and the red and navy shirt from the store.

 "You're welcome.
 Do you like them?"
 "Very much."
 She sighed.
 "But I suppose I shouldn't take them back with me."

Velixar has given us the power and privilege to do what we were always meant to do.
 I need you to embrace this.
 Velixar’s reason is the only reason we need, that we will ever need.
 It is in our blood, our orcish blood, and that is a weight even your muscles cannot hold back.
 We are killers, murderers, butchers, now granted purpose within that.
 That is our fate.
 That is our reason.
 Do you understand?”
 Harruq’s fingers traced the hilts of his new swords.
 He knew what his brother asked.

The telltale flash of glass up ahead was just enough to guide me to a door that was nearly hidden by the rampant foliage.
 I pulled the door open with less effort than expected, and slipped inside.
 The heady fragrance of flowers told me immediately what I'd stumbled across.
 "As if there wasn't enough greenery outside, he's got to have an entire greenhouse too."
 The abrupt lessening of the rain assaulting the glass roof brought back my sense of urgency.
 Nobody could possibly find me while the most intense rainstorm since Noah had sealed up the ark was going on, but I couldn't stay here once it stopped.
 I slipped my battered shoes onto my abused feet, and turned to leave just as the door opened of its own accord.
 I fell back in amazement as he stepped into the pool of light that'd materialized as the clouds parted.
 The jeans were mundane, perfect, but completely normal for all that they were snug in all the right places and loose everywhere else.
 The shirt, unbuttoned in his haste to follow me, was also perfectly normal, entirely believable.

No, no, no," he groaned, refusing to let her put her arms around him or kiss him.
 "I want more, Rick.
 Please kiss me again."
 His groan was deeper this time, and he turned away from her, dropping his head into his hands.
 "Please go to bed, Marie."
 "But Rick--" "Just go to bed.
 Please."
 He didn't look up when she finally complied.
 He'd never known such ecstatic misery.
 He wanted her so much that, 20 minutes after she'd gone, his hands were still trembling.

 “I need a drink,” he said, turning toward the town and trudging back.
 All he could think about was getting a good, stiff drink.
 If he was lucky, he might get in a good bar fight.
 Nothing helped him forget his worries better than walloping a fellow drunken idiot.

“I get restless stuck in here,” he said.
 He dropped his weapons in the corner, shed much of his leather armor, and then released a loud groan as he settled down.
 “Harruq, I must ask a favor of you,” Qurrah said.
 He sat next to his brother.
 “Sure thing,” Harruq said.
 “What you need?”
 Qurrah fiddled with the bones in his pouch.
 “There is someone I need you to meet.”
 Harruq raised an eyebrow.
 “The person you’ve been sneaking off to each night?” he asked.

“People die every day here,” he said.
 “Shall I find their bodies and bring them to you?”
 “For now,” Qurrah said.
 “Yes.
 If the death is fresh, the power should still linger.”
 Harruq reached out, grabbed his brother’s wrist, and clasped his hands in his.
 “I won’t like it,” he said.
 “But I’ll do it for you.”
 “We are better than them,” Qurrah said, standing so he could look through the cracks of the boards across the broken door.
 “Stronger.

“Do any still worship Karak?”
 “Most don’t,” Aurelia said.
 “They’ve turned to worshipping animals now.
 I’ve even heard of some worshipping Celestia once more, hoping she will forgive them and remove their curse.
 They are a sad race, Harruq, but believe me in saying there is no shame in your blood.”
 The half-orc shifted uncomfortably, unable to meet Aurelia’s eyes.
 He watched her trace lines in the grass.
 Seeking a way to lighten the mood, he asked her how to spell his name.
 “Harruq?” she asked.
 “Hrm.

Billy, like his brother Cliff, had a gift for drawing.
 On Sunday morning about nine, I phoned Kenny to tell him Billy was at my house and ask when he meant to pick us up.
 Things weren’t decided yet, he said, because Eddie Carmichael and Mike Beatty wanted to go along, except not to Laguna Beach.
 They wanted to drive to the desert, to the Indio Date Festival, which they claimed was a good party.
 Billy and I didn’t favor the idea of six guys, including big Mike Beatty, riding 150 miles over the mountains and back in Kenny’s mom’s Volkswagen.
 Still, I asked Kenny to call us when the plans were settled.
 He promised to.
 But he didn’t.
 Eric told him not to, I would learn the next day.
 Eric, whom no one recalled having done a single mean act, or said a single mean word, had told Kenny to leave us behind.

An enormous ball of fire erupted at their feet, engulfing all three in flame.
 Two died from the horrible burns.
 A third slumped and whimpered in pain.
 Aurelia walked over to him and knelt on one knee.
 She placed a hand on his head and looked over his wounds while he glared up at her.
 “Your wounds are beyond saving,” she said softly.
 “I’m sorry.”
 She ended his pain with a small lance of ice through his forehead.
 “Thank you for your aid,” one of the elves said.
 “We must fall back to the forest.

And Buddy had his groupies.
 The twins used to joke that Buddy played for scrimption and blow jobs.
 This has some truth to it—the money wasn’t great in those days, asking for more money seen as bourgeois or worse—but the women were wonderful.
 Buddy, though, let it be said, played for one pure reason in those halcyon days.
 He played for the rush, for the approach to the godhead.
 It was religion to Buddy.
 He sought the perfect note, the one that would bring about rapture.
 One night, after a triple billing at the Shell (Black Lung was the middle act that night, sandwiched between the lesser talents of Rubdown and Barry and the White Panthers), Buddy wandered backstage after his set, still in that trance he seemed to enter when he played, and was greeted by a statuesque blond with eyes the color of the Wolf River at Sunset.
 She stepped into his path like a gunfighter.
 Buddy looked deeply into her.

Be wary.
 I will not take sides in this conflict, and neither shall the Quellan elves, but if I find who caused this war, I will kill him.
 It is the least I can do.”
 A great beat of white wings and then the elf was in the air.
 Antonil watched him fly far south, watched until he was a tiny white dot among a blanket of stars.
 Before he stopped watching, however, he saw more than fifty similar white dots line the horizon.
 The guard captain smiled, somehow heartened by the sight.
 “Let us hope for miracles,” he whispered to the night.
 “And let us hope that at tomorrow’s end all my troops are still alive.”
 He stared at the stars for a long while before joining his troops in slumber.

I just didn't want to get into a whole new subject with only ten minutes left."
 Her smile was much more understanding than normal for a classroom situation.
 It took the sting out of the words that were probably just for the people close enough to overhear.
 "Don't you worry, Miss Paige, I'll let you know when I don't think you're keeping up.
 Seeing as you are done though, would you please run something over to Mrs. North?
 I'd do it, but I need to go to a special projects meeting today during lunch."
 As quickly as that, my books were in my backpack and I was on my way to the second story of the school, which housed music, sketching, and all the other forms of art lesser mortals like me would never master.
 The journey would've been completely unremarkable except that I happened to glance into one of the classrooms just before I found Mrs. North's room.
 Even a brief glance screamed art students.
 There were at least twenty people sitting in front of contraptions that looked like a cross between an easel and a desk, and most of them had the look of intense concentration I'd come to associate with Mom attempting to frame a picture.

I didn’t mean to interrupt.” She seemed pleased she had.
 Chevelle’s hand dropped and I could see out of the corner of my eye his face was hard.
 Ruby continued, “Steed said you had a guest so I just used the back…” She trailed off when his stare didn’t soften, but she smiled.
 “You know, you do have your own room.” He stiffened and stood, not at all amused by her implication.
 Ruby began gathering things as she spoke, pretending she hadn’t noticed his attitude.
 “So how did it go?” He relaxed a little but his mood didn’t rise in the least.
 “We shall see.” “Indeed,” she purred.
 “Indeed.” He didn’t look back at me as he left the room, simply directing Ruby to take me with her when she’d finished.
 She seemed more than happy to comply and I was in no doubt we would be training again.
 I slid the hawk sculpture into my pocket.

My questing eyes finally found the last, missing piece.
 There was the gratitude.
 Misplaced on her perfect face.
 Wrong on the features of someone who couldn't possibly need help from a mere mortal, but still there.
 "It's so beautiful.
 I don't know what to say.
 Are you sure you want to give it up?"
 Alec looked back up at me, and his eyes were filled with incredible need.
 I was suddenly struck by the similarities to the me he'd painted, and what I saw written on his face.
 It seemed impossible he would be unsure, that a glorious being like him could ever need anything I could provide, but I couldn't deny it was there.

In the majority of developing countries, government is still the most organized and efficient agency and the only one capable of such significant initiative.
 In formulating strategies, it is essential to take fully into account both the stages and steps of the development process.
 At this stage in their development, it is highly unlikely that food-deficit African nations can make rapid progress toward food self-sufficiency without strong government support and investment to improve technology, training, techno-infrastructure and trade.
 Once the rural sector begins to exhibit its own dynamism, as in the majority of developing countries, there is strong justification for a shift in the role of government from that of prime mover, planner and controller of development to that of catalyst and pioneer.
 Government agencies can tap the potentials of agriculture, identifying new commercial opportunities, educating farmers, demonstrating new potentials, assisting in the transfer and dissemination of new technology, and promoting the establishment of effective organizations – preferably privately or co-operatively owned by farmers or at least with their participation – to process, distribute and market what is produced.
 Coping with the environmental problems to preserve the ecological foundations essential for sustainable agriculture is an area in which government has special responsibilities and must play a leading role on an ongoing basis.
 Regulating the diversion of prime farm land for non-farm uses, expansion of irrigation capacity, control of groundwater exploitation, major programmes for reforestation and to prevent or reverse desertification, and regulation of pesticide use can only be effectively planned, monitored and regulated by governments.
 Comprehensive Strategies
 In this and previous chapters, we have tried to present an integrated perspective of the political, economic and technological factors that need to be taken into account in formulating a comprehensive approach to the issues of peace, food and employment.
 In an effort to illustrate the potential efficacy of this approach in a country representing nearly 25 per cent of the world’s poor, ICPF conducted an in-depth country level study in India to evolve a strategy for stimulating massive increases in job growth and food production (see box pp.

The parts of me that weren't emotionally dead, that were still behaving rationally despite the accident, were screaming in terror.
 There probably wasn't anyone in the school who knew less about fighting than me.
 I knew I should turn around and run away before Cassie realized I was serious, but somehow I didn't care.
 Cassie's arsenal of nasty tricks wouldn't be so effective against someone who'd already been kicked out of their house and moved to another state.
 All I really needed to do was survive the next few minutes.
 I'd be out of the state before she really got busy making my life miserable.
 A dozen different things I could say blew through my mind, but they were all competing, and none of them fit the situation.
 In typical fashion, I found myself without anything clever to say.
 Instead I just stood there and stared at Cassie.
 I'd thought things were tense already, but where everyone had been quiet before, now they were motionless too.

The elf laughed a little but said nothing.
 Instead, she walked over and gave Harruq a quick peck on the cheek.
 “Keep your big butt safe, okay?” she said.
 The half-orc tried to answer but his mouth refused to cooperate.
 Somehow, it seemed to have become unhinged.
 Besides, it wasn’t as if he could think of anything to say.
 All his mind could concentrate on was the feel of the elf’s soft lips on his cheek, the flowery scent of her perfume mixed with sweat, and the quick brush of her breasts against his arm.
 By the time his jaw and mind began working again, Aurelia was laughing.
 “What’s so funny?” he demanded.
 The elf smiled.

Jim – Skinny is the comic relief.
 If the entire thing were just Sumo fighting, and killing his enemies, it would get kind of boring, so they have someone to laugh at.
 Skinny’s other job is to distract the bad guys while Sumo Assassin charges up his Super Sumo Slap Attack.
 And last but not least, Skinny is there to make sure that Sumo gets his money’s worth when they go eat at a buffet.
 Eugene – (laughs) They’re the dumbest pair of heroes ever.
 Jim (goes back to reading his comic book, till something occurs to him) Gene, is there something wrong?
 You haven’t acted like a gangster in the last two minutes, you feeling sick or something?
 Eugene – I gave up being a gangster last night.
 Jim – Huh?

“Let’s talk…” She leaned in further and something glistened in the air between us.
 I froze, unable to move away.
 “Stop.” Chevelle’s voice was sharp as the redhead was whisked away from me, laughing.
 Her curls brushed my face on their way past, taking my head on a dizzying spin.
 “Just having a little fun, Vattier,” she said.
 It sounded too far away.
 Or as if I were in a tunnel.
 Chevelle was reprimanding her, and then at once they were gone.
 My head swirled and I felt off balance.
 I started to stumble, but a strong hand caught my arm.

Development is like a chemical reaction that is determined by the variety and quantity of elements present and the conditions under which they are put together.
 If one essential element or condition is missing, a social transition like a chemical reaction may not take place at all.
 The absence of peace in war-torn Africa or democratic freedoms in former colonial nations, the absence of social stability or an entrepreneurial class, the absence of a functioning banking or educational system, the absence of the minimum necessary infrastructure for transportation and communication – any one of these may be enough to prevent transition until the deficit is made up.
 If even an inessential element or condition is missing, the process of transition may take much longer than would otherwise be necessary.
 Lack of information, lack of education, lack of necessary skills, lack of supportive laws or incentives or protection against losses – insufficiency in any of these areas may be enough to slow or delay the process of change by years or even decades.
 The world needs a coherent intellectual framework for understanding and dealing with radical transitions.
 High priority should be given to developing a fresh conceptual approach that is not en cumbered by allegiance to existing theories and systems.
 Transitions should be regarded as social transformations which depend on and result in corresponding changes in the political, economic and other spheres.
 Efforts to guide a multi-dimensional social transition through uni-dimensional strategies, particularly those limited to manipulation of macro-economic policy, are unlikely to yield the anticipated results.
 Even those transitions which are apparently confined to economic activities within a stable political context necessarily depend on changes in social attitudes and in social institutions which can be dealt with most effectively by assuming a wider perspective of the process.

There were maps of the mountains and forests, showing each village and town.
 Curved lines of azure cut through the page, rivers and streams, and I had a pang of regret for not studying maps with Junnie.
 The next pages were a copy of the record-keeper’s report to Grand Council about his findings.
 And his conclusion.
 There were definitely missing pages here, but something dreadful had happened for certain.
 His official report should have been factual and serious, but the description was loaded with fear.
 Even his script became shaky as it reached the final word… Extinction.
 All the northern clans were gone, according to his account.
 Something had wiped out an entire region.
 The last pages were lists of clan members in order of family names.

"Your mother’s?"
 "Yes.
 It's beautiful.
 It's covered with lace and pearls, and it has a 15-foot train.
 But the important thing is that it was my grandmother's.
 She wore it, and then my mother wore it.
 I've always known that I'd wear it when I get married."
 He frowned.
 "It means that much to you?
 You want to go home so that you can be married in that dress?"

 But now .

But he cared about her too much to press her.

 It was only 6:30.

 your kisses make me and ask her about-about making love.
 But there's no point to it!

 She took the handkerchief he'd just pulled from his pocket, wiping her face.
 "It's so horrible.
 If-if I were to keep this beautiful ring, the first thing I'd want to do would be to run to my mother and tell her all about it.
 But I can't go to her.
 And when I can finally run to her, I won't be wearing this ring."

“We’ll wait until morning.
 I could use a bit more sleep.”
 She walked away, cast a levitation spell upon herself, and then settled in for sleep hovering an inch above the grass.
 “Odd girl,” Qurrah whispered.
 Harruq forced a laugh.
 To Qurrah’s eyes, he looked exhausted, and the shrinking of his muscles was glaring.
 “I’m sorry I left you there at Woodhaven,” Harruq said.
 “And I’m sorry you were alone when Velixar died.
 How did it happen?”
 “Elves came and attacked.

And then I thought, What else do you have to do, sit here and blow up frogs?
 It was all the convincing I needed.
 Slinking out from the branches of the spruce, I crept low along the trees and brush as I followed my watcher north.
 Chapter Six Trails
 Chevelle kept a quick pace and I found myself struggling to keep up.
 Unlike me, he wasn’t dodging between rocks and trees, bending out of sight and watching the ground to keep from breaking twigs while he tried to keep from being spotted.
 I cursed the formal dress I’d been dragging as it snagged on a low-lying thicket, flinging another string of beads into the soft dirt.
 I considered dumping it, but didn’t think it was the best idea to be sneaking around the forest unclothed.
 After crossing a few soggy patches of moss, the hem was damp and darkened.
 I might have ripped some of the excess material off, but Chevelle’s movement wasn’t leaving me time for that.

Anvil smiled.
 A movement at the tree line caught everyone’s attention, and I turned to find Chevelle’s onetime guest, Asher.
 He stood in the shadows, staff in hand, as if allowing us to see.
 The air was still as he inclined his head toward Chevelle and then turned, a long, dark braid whipping behind him as he disappeared into the brush.
 This seemed to mean something to the group, something like relief.
 I stared after him, but Anvil stepped forward, thumping his balled fist against his chest in a gesture I didn’t understand.
 Grey followed, repeating the action and adding a single nod, and Ruby clasped her hands, bouncing excitedly from heel to toe.
 I felt myself drawing back together, tied by the knots in my stomach and mind.
 A tandem wolf howl sounded in the distance.
 My stomach swam in unease.

I hadn't realized just how fond of me Mrs. Campbell was.
 My mind whirling with too many thoughts to sort out, I turned to go back to my desk, only to find Alec staring at me.
 He still didn't seem happy to be sharing the same room with me, but the complete disgust from half an hour before had been replaced with something more measuring.
 In Spanish, Mrs. Tiggs took special delight in telling us that she'd started grading our tests and a couple of them weren't looking very good.
 I suffered through the last hour of school and then hurried to my locker.
 I didn't really want to meet up with Britney, but I also didn't want to alienate her any more than I already had.
 I shouldn't have even bothered.
 I waited around for a full fifteen minutes before finally heading over to the tutoring lab.
 Britney was watching the door when I arrived.
 She didn't even bother trying to mask the flash of satisfaction that crossed her face when I walked in late, obviously having spent the last little while waiting for her.

A hand touched his forehead.
 All the anger that had raged inside Harruq roared like a fire suddenly loosed upon a dry forest.
 Sweat poured from his skin.
 His head jerked upward, his eyes soaking in the white of Velixar’s hand and the dim glow of the stars.
 Power flowed into him, his muscles stretching and tightening in a chaotic manner.
 “Rise, Harruq Tun,” Velixar said.
 “Revel in the power of Karak.”
 “By the gods, brother, if you could see yourself,” Qurrah said, his voice full of shock and wonder.
 “Just one god, Qurrah,” Velixar corrected.
 “All this by the hand of one.

“As you can plainly see, I am nowhere near the forest,” Velixar said.
 His voice was calm, disarming.
 Dieredon did not buy it.
 “Give me your name,” he said.
 “Earn the privilege,” Velixar countered.
 The elf’s arms blurred, and then the bow was in his hands.
 He pulled no arrow, though, for he held the weapon much like one would hold a staff.
 “Leave this place,” Dieredon ordered as two long blades snapped out of either side of the bow and many spikes punched out the front.
 The man in black rose to his feet, an aura of death and despair rolling out around him.
 “You should not threaten those who can rip the bones from your body with a thought,” he said, his voice dripping with venom.

She wondered what Rick was doing right now.
 Had he gone to work?
 She suspected that he'd been too upset to work.
 He'd probably sat in the garden until he'd known for sure she was gone.
 He might even still be there, hoping she hadn't gone back, that she was lost somewhere in 2011 and would eventually call out to him to come find her.
 Tears began to run down her cheeks.
 She fell asleep and dreamed that she, her parents, her brother, and Rick were at Cape Cod.
 When she awoke a couple of hours later, she felt feverish.
 Frowning, she felt her forehead.

 Are you going to collapse like you did last night?"
 "Thanks, Brit.
 You look ravishing too, and no, I'm not going to collapse.
 I just haven't been sleeping very well lately.
 I'm probably coming down with something."
 Britney shrugged with the supreme indifference of someone whose world extended only a few feet beyond their immediate person.
 "Just don't get me sick if you do.
 Ashure Day isn't that far away."
 We were halfway to the tutoring lab, and the halls were nearly empty.

If you haven't realized it yet, we change our shapes.
 Your friend already hurt himself learning that.” Seth wasn't looking so good.
 He was bent over and was grabbing at his neck.
 I then realized that the snake was now a smaller brown colored snake and had its whole body wrapped completely around his neck.
 I had an awful feeling that I couldn't help Seth without hurting him.
 I was helpless.
 Emily and Jason were farther off fighting their own swarm.
 I could see from here that they were slowly losing too.
 Emily continued to try to fry the creatures or knock them away with air, but it wasn't really working.
 I kept seeing Jason's knives fly off into the woods, or sink into the ground, instead of hitting their mark.

And, as a young man, who appreciated a young woman who loved lingerie, well, we had some fiery times.
 Hot as monkeys.
 She had these little white things…I don’t know where she got ‘em.
 Let’s move onto a higher plane.
 I guess you want to hear about the recording of Turntable Poison.
 CM:  	Yes.
 How did that start?
 BG:  	Dickinson.
 Jim, he got us a recording studio at Ardent.
 Got us some studio time.

When she didn't respond, he tilted her chin up, making her look into his eyes.
 "Stay here, Marie.
 Marry me.
 We'll have a wedding night more exciting than anything you could imagine."
 Her breath caught, and tears filled her eyes.
 "I-I can't, Rick.
 I have to go home."
 She squeezed his hand.
 "My home, my family, everything I know is in 1927.
 My mother has been saving her wedding gown for me.

As suddenly as it'd changed before, Alec's fist relaxed, shrinking back into its normal size and shape like melting snow.
 "All right.
 You can come.
 I don't like it.
 Don't like knowing you're guaranteed not to survive my passing, but it's your choice."
 I was too busy being amazed by how quickly he'd stopped shaking, how rapidly his eyes had gone back to normal to really wonder whether or not it was all just an elaborate ruse designed to lull me into a false sense of security so he could trap me here.
 "Not that I'm complaining, mind you, but why the sudden change?"
 Alec gave me a lopsided smile of his own.
 "My death is nearly certain, but there's always a chance I'll somehow survive.
 As unlikely as that is, I don't want to survive and then find I've poisoned you against me.

“Maybe you should sit down,” he warned.
 That sounded like a good idea.
 “Half-breed?” I asked, unable to form full sentences.
 “Half fairy, half elf.” He sat in a chair as he started to answer and I kept moving past the bench where I intended to land and crawled onto his lap, curling my feet up, knees to my chest.
 His voice seemed mesmerizing as he continued, “Her mother was a fairy from the West.
 Fiery one, her.” I wrapped my arms around my legs, holding my knees tight, and placed my chin there to rest my head.
 “Tell me more.” It was all I could do to pay attention to his words, but I was fascinated by their sound.
 “Her father was a dark elf.
 When her mother died during childbirth, he left her here in the village.
 I suppose it was for the best, really, since she can’t fly.

It resembled an escape tunnel from a prison movie.
 None of this was intended for the eyes of a parent.
 I don’t believe mine or Thomas’s place ever looked half as bad, but if I could see the boxing ring, mismatched couches and the hanging roach clip from where I stand now, who knows what it would look like to me.
 We spent the next 12 hours cleaning, hauling and tossing.
 We rented a local storage unit and brought the furniture and clothes there but we tossed out more than we took.
 We filled nearly fifty large black garbage bags of filth and drug paraphernalia and left them for trash pickup in the alley behind the house.
 Most things of value had been stolen or pawned.
 One of these things was the expensive camera we had given him for Christmas.
 It was at the pawnshop.
 Agenda Item Two: Retrieve valuables from the pawnshop.

Shall we go?” Seth shrugged, “I guess.
 The answer to that question doesn’t really matter.” The dwarf held his hand out, “Shall we go then?” I shrugged, “Lead the way, shorty.” The dwarf gave me an annoyed look and walked towards the arch.
 I expected him to go right through but he disappeared in a swirl of black mist.
 Jason shrugged and ran in after him.
 “Wait Jason,” Emily called.
 “Dang, never mind.” She disappeared too.
 I went to follow her and hesitated.
 Seth walked up to me, “You nervous?” “Why shouldn’t I be?” I said, shaking.
 “Is going to a different world supposed to be vacation-relaxing-in-the-sun easy?” He smirked, “I never said that.” “You implied it,” I said, with a roll of my eyes.
 He sighed and pushed me into the doorway, the dark, swirling mist swallowing me up.

This new perspective will enable us to generate effective strategies for addressing many problems that have thus far defied solution.
 In addition to these nine factors, two powerful revolutions are re-drawing the landscape of the global society and generating an unparalleled dynamism for rapid progress on the issues of critical concern to humanity.
 Democracy, Peace and Development
 The first is a revolutionary movement from authoritarianism to democracy that has travelled around the world during the past decade.
 The initial wave swept through Latin America in the early 1980s, replacing military regimes in Peru, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Paraguay and Bolivia.
 In 1979, 12 out of 19 Latin American countries had authoritarian governments.
 By 1993, every country except Cuba and Haiti had a democratically elected government.
 Glasnost and perestroika in the USSR initiated a second and more powerful tide of freedom that expanded rapidly through Eastern Europe and then to other continents, in the same way that India’s attainment of freedom from colonial rule gave birth to a host of freedom movements and new nations after the Second World War.
 The number of single-party or military states and people under autocratic rule has fallen dramatically since 1980, and the trend continues.
 This shift to multi-party democracy, when coupled with a free press and an independent judiciary, vastly reduces the threat of large-scale wars similar to those that have twice shaken the world in this century.

She attended no church but disdained atheists.
 Lord of the Flies she called propaganda by which teachers could argue the superiority of adults.
 Catcher in the Rye she applauded because Holden Caulfield appreciated jazz and was nearly as cynical as herself.
 She dismissed Nietzsche as a syphilitic blowhard.
 While we gabbed, Richard might eye us as though he had something to say.
 But the moment would pass, and he would turn back to gawk at the tube until Sylvia ordered him to fetch her cigarettes, or made him stand still while she straightened his tie, or checked to see that he had zipped all the way.
 Observing them made us recommit ourselves to becoming supermen.
 One Friday night, I arrived just as they were leaving for a jazz club.
 Before climbing into Richard’s car, Sylvia commanded me, “If you brought any liquor, Kenneth, go away.” I agreed and waited until they drove off before scooping a pint of bourbon and a bottle of ginger ale out of my Chevrolet’s trunk.
 I wanted to get numb.

Falling production and incomes coupled with soaring prices are combining to cause political instability, social unrest and extreme hardship to the populations of these nations.
 If not remedied, this could result in a reversal of the remarkable progress towards world peace achieved during the past seven years.
 Arms exports: The cutting of defence budgets has generated increasing pressure on arms manufacturers to seek export markets.
 Although the value (in 1992 US dollars) of arms exports fell by more than 50 per cent from 1988 to 1992, it still represents nearly $20 billion annually.
 These weapons, over 80 per cent of which are supplied by the five permanent members of the Security Council, directly contribute to the growing instability and violence.
 During the last decade, 40 per cent of these weapons were sold to trouble spots such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.
 These are, indeed, severe challenges that call for urgent and determined action by the global community on a scale unprecedented during times of peace.
 But the lessons of the past decade should caution us against accepting as a fait accompli statistical projections that predict the outcome of our effort over the next ten years before it has even begun.
 No such determinism exists, except in our minds.
 Given the right leadership, we can change the course, amend the rules, alter the structures and accelerate action to achieve an entirely different and more favourable set of outcomes.

 Isn’t that what the recipe called for?
 Johnny – I couldn’t find any.

 Jim – What did you use then?
 Johnny – Food coloring.
 Liz – You used red food coloring in place of chicken’s blood?
 Johnny – No, I used yellow food coloring.

I stared it and turned around to see Emily come back in.
 But not before my eyes caught a flash of blue.
 Emily and I parked our bikes and headed into the woods and towards the clearing.
 We stepped into it, and I took in the familiar feeling.
 Out of all the places we’ve all been, this place felt the safest, as if it were surrounded by a good force, not bad for once.
 We often met here when we weren’t all together.
 I sat down next to Emily on a log.
 Minutes later Jason and Seth emerged from the trees.
 They weren’t smiling or doing anything suspicious so I figured we were safe, for now.
 They sat down across from us.

I'd been desperate to win a ticket, and he had to take yet another opportunity to rub in the fact that he'd already seen it.
 That he was rich enough to see it anywhere in the world as often as he wanted to.
 Even my desire to tell Alec off wasn't strong enough to overcome the pure joy at having won.
 The next two hours floated by, and before I would've believed it possible, I found myself heading towards the tutoring lab.
 Rachel met me outside the door, her face lit up with a smile even more striking than her usual expression.
 "You won.
 I'm so excited that you won.
 Guess what.
 I traded tickets with Suzanne Bergerman, so we get to sit together!"
 Life couldn't get any better.

The controversy over the relationship between culture and development is complicated by the fact that development both creates and destroys cultural forms and values.
 Every developmental achievement results in an abandonment of old behaviours and attitudes, and the acceptance of new ones.
 Development destroys survival-based, traditional values and creates achievement-oriented, progressive values.
 Over the last two centuries in countries around the world development has strengthened expansive values that encourage greater freedom, tolerance, individual initiative, self-confidence and self-respect, dynamism, risk-taking, efficiency, punctuality, organization, communication and cooperation, open-mindedness and respect for new ideas, innovation and creativity.
 At the same time development has weakened values that support respect for tradition and hierarchy, seniority and authority, self-effacement and humility, patience and perseverance, generosity and self-sacrifice.
 The nineteenth century tolerated values based on the exploitation by people over people through slavery, colonialism and war, and the domination of nature by man.
 The guiding values for the coming century are freedom and respect for the individual, social equity, tolerance of human diversity and harmony with the environment.
 Development is widely regarded as the cause of moral decline and increasing corruption, crime and violence.
 These negative consequences are primarily due to the fact that freedom has been extended to vast sections of the population which were confined in the past by rigid social barriers and minimum expectations, so they never had need or occasion to embrace the values they now eschew.
 The earlier self-restraint has been replaced by a self-assertion that has not yet acquired the productive values needed for achievement.

He shouted until his head turned purple but made no sound for the effort.
 Then Qurrah cast another spell that made him go all tough and rigid.
 Felt like I was holding a stick.
 We took him inside and put him on the floor.
 “He wasn’t supposed to die,” Harruq said, staring right into Aurelia’s eyes so she would know he spoke the truth.
 “We didn’t mean to have what happened happen, but well…‌Qurrah put a bunch of meat on Perry’s face.
 It was old and rancid.
 Poor guy still had to keep smelling it though, and then Qurrah cast his spell.
 “The meat started bubbling and turning watery.
 It ran down his face, getting into his eyes.

“I’m not leaving until I get my answer.” Seth traced the dirt with the end of a stick.
 “You say I’m stubborn” I laughed and he continued, “Listen, I don’t even know if it’s true or not.
 There’s no need for me to worry any of you.
 That’s why I didn’t say anything.” “I still don’t care, Seth.” I said.
 He made a face, “Jazell I really don’t know if I should say anything…” I interrupted him again, “Seth just give up trying to talk me into not listening.
 It’s a waste of breath.” I took my own stick and threw it at him.
 He ducked, of course, and it landed on the ground.
 “What if whatever you’re not telling us happens and we never knew?
 How would that help anyone?” He looked down and mumbled something that sounded like, “You couldn’t help.” When he looked back up he said, “Fine you win, I’ll tell you.” He didn’t sound happy about it.
 “I’m waiting.” “You know, when Emily asked for any warnings that we were given?” “Yeah.” I had a bad feeling where this was going.

The homeless, hungry, and destitute flooded the rows of abandoned buildings, clawing them away from their legal owners with their very presence, or sometimes their murders.
 Harruq and Qurrah played that game well.
 They had grown up on the streets of Veldaren and fought for every scrap of food they’d eaten.
 They had punched and kicked for every soft, dry bed.
 Then, one day, they finally killed.
 “A fine home is any home that’s yours,” Harruq said as he forced back a couple planks sealing a window.
 “Ain’t that right, Qurrah?”
 “Whatever you say.”
 Once the window was unblocked, the two climbed in.
 They lived in what had once been a large shed.

It was hard for him to see.
 He struggled back up, but fell, then Rodregas felt a presence to his right.
 It was too small to be Doi’van and Rodregas staggered over reaching for him, determined to take one final slaver with him.
 His wounded leg buckled again, and Rodregas tried to reach for the ground to slow his fall, but something was wrong with his arm and it did not move.
 For a split second he saw the ground coming up to hit him in the face.
 And then... darkness.
 CHAPTER 10 THE OTHER KIND OF PAIN
 Rodregas laid there looking at blue swirls for a long time, wondering where he was.
 He was not sure if he was awake; his mind seemed heavy with dreams, and shifting images.
 It took him a long time before he remembered the battle.

Maybe I could just wash it out.
 Nauseous, I stepped into the pool, sinking beneath its surface.
 A thought crossed my mind that was darker than the rest, that said maybe I should stay under, but the pressure to draw air stung my lungs.
 I could not drown the desire to breathe.
 I pushed through the water, gasping and cold, struggling to climb from the muck as I stood and walked out.
 I was drenched, the material of the long gown soaked and heavy and more uncomfortable than ever.
 I loosened the wet corset ties and dropped the dress into a pile at my feet, shivering as I stepped free of it and onto a rock.
 I grabbed a shirt from the pile, and then the slim pants, aware of how nice the fabric felt, how good the cut.
 A leather vest laced over the top.
 It seemed they were tailored for me.

Vaelor will be furious at the death of family, however distant.
 He will have every excuse to war with the elves and we will exploit that war to our purposes.”
 “Will you accompany us?” Qurrah asked.
 Velixar shook his head.
 “Bring me the head of the messenger.
 I will retrieve an elf to deliver it to the king.”
 The man in black stood and motioned to the stars.
 “Follow the left wing,” he said, his finger pointing to the constellation in the stars referred to as the raven.
 “It will not be long before you see the light of their campfire.
 Make haste.

Actually, scanning wasn't the right word for it.
 I just kind of looked that way and instantly found my eyes drawn to Brandon.
 He was surrounded by people, mostly female, all attractive.
 Taking in all of those lithe, tan bodies, I suddenly felt incredibly inferior.
 All of the impending skin cancer deaths suddenly didn't seem quite so important.
 I looked away before anyone could see me staring.
 Britney was still looking longingly at a pile of fries.
 When I looked up again Brandon was looking back at me with a smile that communicated all kinds of things I'd always thought you needed words for.
 His expression seemed to say he was glad to see me, embarrassed to be the center of attention, and sorry he couldn't get away from his friends to come over and say hi.
 I felt my face go hot with embarrassment.

Turns out, just because I did drugs and knew people who were addicted to drugs I was still not qualified to understand how to break someone from craving the drugs that satisfy their addiction.
 Brandon seemed better and we thought we had helped him simply because we incarcerated him at home away from his peers until he had the drugs out of his system.
 In our mind, he was cured.
 Unfortunately, the problem had not been solved so easily.
 Like any good movie, this solution came too easily and too early in the drama.
 He was such a child then, easily influenced and dealing with challenges in counterproductive ways.
 He was caught being truant, being out past curfew, being with a kid who stole a wallet.
 He was involved in multiple car accidents.
 Brandon struggled and was barely making it through high school, so we changed him to a problem-child school to enable him to graduate.
 He and his younger brother Bryce were growing apart just as I had grown apart from my brother Thomas, which was torturous for me and Lisa to watch.

I believe nobody heard his stories from Vietnam until years afterward.
 I don’t pry, so I can’t be sure what goes on inside him, but I have no reason to think he believes in God, or that he doesn’t.
 But whether he believes or not, Cliff has gotten well blessed since our evening with Billy Graham.
 He has four wonderful kids, and Toni, who is one of those rarest of people who appear to grow brighter, stronger, and more beautiful every year.
 Cliff and Billy's dad, Cliff Senior, invited me to dinner not many years ago.
 The evening became an in vino veritas experience.
 After some cups, he said, “Ken, you should know it was me that hounded my son into serving in Vietnam.” I held back from saying, Yeah, I know.
 “So he goes over there, fighting in a war that was all wrong, and he saw things nobody should have to.
 He comes back drinking hard.
 And then, thank God, he met Toni.” The man from whom Cliff and Bill Torrey inherited their reserved and stoic characters snuffed and wiped his eyes.

Marie would be embarrassed if she thought Teri and Jeremy had seen them kissing.
 "Mmm."
 She kissed him again.
 Rick returned her kiss and then gently disengaged her arms.

 "I think I like 1927 cars better than 2011 cars," Marie said as Rick slid behind the wheel.
 "Why?"
 "I could sit right beside you in a 1927 car."

 Great braids that hung on either side of her face.
 And the first girl in our class to get tits.
 She was something else—she let me touch her naked ass, showed me it right before she unzipped me and took me into her mouth.
 (laughs) I didn’t even know what was happening.
 I kept thinking, is this right?
 Is this something humans are supposed to do?
 And should I come?
 Will it poison her?

CM:  	Anything else you want to say about that song?
 BG:  	Uh, just that the line “It’s raining in my heart” is, of course, an homage to Buddy.
 And the line “It’s raining Grabenhorst” is about an old school friend.

 Good.
 It’s got that “Green River” riff to it, a chugging thing, even though it’s acoustic, it sounds like a freight train, don’t you think?

 Like “Mary Had a Little Lamb.” Consciously so?

And I was never the one to stop, Mother.
 The more passionate the kisses became, the more I wanted.
 I-I really didn't understand until my last evening with him that we couldn't just kiss forever, that eventually kisses wouldn't be enough.
 If he hadn't stopped, we would have gone on and on and on until--"  She caught her breath, biting her lip and fixing her eyes on the handkerchief she was clenching.
 Mrs. Tranton leaned forward, putting a hand on her daughter's knee.
 "I understand."
 Marie glanced up.
 "I love him, Mother."
 "Are you sure you’ll never see him again?"
 Tears welled up in her eyes and spilled over.

Rick hesitated at the kitchen door, glancing at Marie.
 He wanted to beg her to stay with him, to get down on his knees if he had to, cry, plead.
 But that would just make both of them miserable.
 She'd already made her decision.
 He led her into the garden.
 "I'll sit here and think about your life in 1927.
 I think if you just walk straight out that way, you'll get home."
 She linked her arms around his neck, still clutching the paper bag.
 "I love you with all my heart, Rick.
 This is tearing me apart.

“If you must ask then you did not, at least not directly, though I did hear you startle awake.
 Perhaps a fleeting glimpse of it…”
 “Qurrah,” Harruq said, crossing his arms and frowning at him.
 “What is this about?
 Tell me.”
 “Remember the necromancer we witnessed at the siege?” Qurrah asked.
 “It is him.
 He has haunted my dreams lately, and today he whispered the name of a place I have already researched for my own purposes.
 I think we are being guided, though I dare not pretend to know why.”
 Harruq shifted, the dark expression on his brother’s face making him uncomfortable.

"He danced with me!
 I danced with a movie star!"
 "I saw."
 He smiled, stroking a damp tendril of hair from her face.
 "Was it fun?"
 "It was incredible!
 I can't believe I danced with him!"
 "Come sit down for a minute and have a Coke."
 He managed to keep her still for less than five minutes.
 They danced almost non-stop for the next hour and a half, and then Rick declared he'd fall asleep behind the wheel if they didn't leave.

Peace, democracy, employment and food security are mutually interdependent.
 The efforts proposed to promote peace, democracy and employment generation will mitigate the problem of food security to a considerable extent.
 In addition, Chapter Five of the Commission’s report highlights direct interventions that are needed to address the problem at the level of agricultural productivity, among which the following are particularly relevant in the present context:
 Farm Productivity: The attraction of high technology service industries should not blind us to the fact that a large section of humanity still depends on agriculture as its main source of income and livelihood.
 Farm productivity in these countries is typically less than a fourth or fifth the average attained by other countries.
 Low agricultural productivity results in high cost food, low rural incomes and limited employment opportunities, both on farm and in downstream industries.
 As a revolution in agricultural productivity provided the impetus for rapid industrialization in Britain and later USA in the 19th Century, rapid modernization of agricultural technology, a shift to commercial crops, improved linkages for credit, marketing and processing can act as a catalyst for employment generation and economic growth in many developing countries today.
 As some countries have already proven, high productivity does not necessarily require large tracks of land or high levels of mechanization, but it does require quality inputs, adoption of advanced cultivation practices, efforts to improve the productivity of water, access to credit, infrastructure for storage, producer-oriented marketing and industries for processing.
 Information Empowerment: The poor quality, slow speed and inadequate reach of extension services is the bane of farming in many developing countries.
 ICT can be harnessed to provide farmers with access to state-of-the-art technical advice, quality inputs and market information.

That one day our families would spend a holiday together, and that holiday would lead to another and eventually things would be as normal as they could be.
 Part of me also felt that my older brother was in need of a way to get back in good graces of the family and that maybe I could give this to him by reaching out.
 I contacted Thomas in desperation, and he did have the connections to get my son into Narconon, a private rehab program that we couldn’t afford.
 We put the word out through some of Brandon’s friends that his Uncle Thomas could help him get into this private rehab if he wanted the help, but Brandon had to want it.
 Chapter 22: In Sight of the Bottom About a month had passed since we talked with Thomas and sent the word out to Brandon.
 Last we heard, Brandon was about 400 miles south working with a friend.
 I wondered what prison would be like for Brandon and wished he were in prison because at least we’d know where he was; he wouldn’t be a drug addict wandering the streets.
 Strange irony, that.
 Strange feeling it stirred in me, realizing that my intervention to keep Brandon out of prison could backfire so terribly.
 Before he got help now, he would need to hit rock bottom.

Vincent slowed down a little more as I was busy taking in the incredible pinks and purples that were dominating the western sky.
 It was like someone had splashed glowing paint across a window and then gone back and painted in picture-perfect clouds to complete the scene.
 I'd seen plenty of amazing sunsets back home, but there was something about the rugged, almost hostile, skyline here that gave this one a spectacular level of depth.
 Maybe Mom was right about the west after all.
 Sure, it was hotter than Satan's kitchen, and a dermatologist's worst nightmare, but the skylines were amazing.
 Brandon opened his eyes as I let out a sigh of contentment.
 "Bored already?
 We're only halfway there."
 As I opened my mouth to respond, Vincent turned off the road onto a trail that hardly looked wide enough for a Geo Metro let alone his monster truck.
 I let out a yelp as we dropped down a small hill and then started climbing up the other side of the gully with a small bounce.

Art – My boy, indeed it is, and if the world is lucky you won’t ever have children and pass on our cursed genes.
 Jim – What about Johnny?
 Can he still breed?
 Art – In his current mindset, I doubt that your brother will ever attract a woman willing to bear his children.
 Though he has got your mother’s looks which is a big help to that cause.
 But it’s a dark subject on which we linger.
 Have you got a hug for your old man?
 Jim – Anything to do with both Johnny or Mother can be considered a dark subject.
 (Hugs Art)  How was your trip?
 Did you enjoy the ‘convention’ in Florida?

Rachel met me on my way back to my table to gather up my books.
 "She left with Rick Anders."
 I mustered a grin.
 "Was my panic that obvious?"
 "No, I was just watching her to see who she had in her sights for the Ashure Day Dance.
 Then when I saw her leave I realized that would mean you wouldn't have a ride home."
 I put the last couple of books in my backpack and shrugged.
 "I think she's mad.
 I guess she has pretty good reason to be, but she hasn't even given me a chance to apologize."
 The first half of Rachel's comment finally sank in, and I nearly tripped.

They try, and some of them are really good.
 Alec is probably the most controlled person I've ever met, and Isaac is so disciplined he's almost immune to the power plays.
 Even so, sometimes it's like they operate on a shorter fuse than the rest of us."
 My throat was so dry it took me two attempts to clear it.
 "Could Alec have won?"
 The question stuck in my throat, reluctant to come out.
 It felt disloyal to Alec but I had to know.
 "I don't know.
 Individually Alec could take any of them.
 There's a reason he's dominant to all of the rest of them.

His ex-fiancée.
 "She isn't my Kim--not any more."
 It had been over a year since they'd broken up.
 "Yeah.
 So I thought maybe she could be my Kim.
 I ran into her at lunch downtown, and I invited her out for drinks that evening.
 She's good, Rick.
 It was the first time I'd been alone with her--you know, without you and my own date--and it took her less than ten minutes to figure out that I'm not exactly the marrying type.
 I still don't know how I gave myself away.
 It was a first."

Like Richard Nixon, I was born in a house my father built, a basement he poured.
 A sandlot diamond behind the house where I got a splinter once in my rear.
 The bigger boys laughed.
 A street of gravel with ditches for drainage: Eighth Street.
 And a cocker spaniel bitch named Cyrano.
 Born with eyes the color of the sea, green and mud, a dull roiling behind a semitranslucent screen.
 Born in a matter of minutes, so fast the nurses were dubious, the doctor almost late.
 The town was Lewiston, New York, a carbuncle on the gritty side of gritty Niagara Falls, New York, the former honeymoon capital of the United States, a country which, like Niagara Falls in microcosm, had lately fallen into disrepair.
 Now, Niagara Falls, Ontario, just over the national border, where my mother's incredibly large family hailed from, was bright and brisk and clean and gardeny, the shiny flipside of its American counterpart.
 I’ve seen the great falls frozen; I’ve seen it turned off as if there were a giant tap.

The void was reluctant to let me go, stripping me of memories and experiences as I fought my way free.
 By the time I was near surfacing I no longer remembered just how much I'd wanted to stay.
 Britney was pacing back and forth when I opened my eyes.
 She had her cell phone out and was looking like she wanted to dial 911, but was worried about the possible fallout.
 I was on the ground, which for some reason made me more irritable than it should have.
 Didn't she realize how hard it was to make it over to someone before collapsing like that?
 It kind of defeated the whole point if they then put you on the ground where your clothes would take their normal, instantaneous-collapse beating.
 "Oh my gosh, are you okay?
 I wasn't sure what to do."
 "I'm okay, I just need a minute."

It was the kind of thing that Mom was always trying to capture with her camera, but which never seemed to turn out quite as good as the real thing.
 The sunset wasn't what captured my interest though, it was the greenery.
 Mom's room looked out to the west, the gorgeous side that reminded me of the place and people that would always be home.
 Mom carting me off to the middle of nowhere wasn't going to change that.
 There was a huge tree on the far edge of the yard.
 It was a species I didn't recognize, but it still called to me.
 For a second I could almost hear a familiar voice whispering in my ear.
 "Come on, Adri.
 Cindi's already climbed up to the second set of branches.
 You can do it, but you don't have to do it all by yourself, let me help you."

 BG:  	Yeah, yeah.
 People die from cigarettes.
 But more die from fettered ambition.
 I heard my dad’s band exactly once.
 I don’t remember why.
 We had to go to The Vapors for something and mom plunked me down in a chair and said, just stay here, I’ll be back.
 Well, it was like the music held me there—she could have been gone for hours.
 I was riveted.
 And there was my dad, looking cool, and blowing beautiful, liquid melodies out of that licorice stick.

I think I wanted to play music, initially, to please her, to catch her attention.
 Isn’t that always the way, man, we fucking men, looking for female approval?
 Patty Grabenhorst.
 Just saying the name is like a spell to me.
 Man, I wonder where that chick is today—she must have grown up to be something.
 She moved away before high school, but, already you could see the beauty there.
 She was, um, saucy.
 Saucy at ten.
 Hey, that’s a great song title.

I didn’t understand why they would want my mother’s pendant, but I knew not to ask.
 I knew what happened when you spoke before being instructed.
 The guard stood, facing me, both hands poised to take the leather chain over my head as I stared on insensibly.
 His touch lingered and I glanced down, surprised to see he had a firm grip on the necklace but wasn’t lifting it, couldn’t lift it.
 I looked to the council leaders as the guard turned toward the table and decisively stepped away from me.
 “The crystal will not be removed,” he said.
 Though he spoke only to the elders, it set into motion behind us a wave of murmurs that filled the room, reverberating up the high ceiling.
 A council elder silenced the witnesses and then trained on me.
 “Who instructed you in fusion?” I didn’t have an answer.
 I’d never heard of fusion.

It was impossible to say for certain how long I sat looking at the gentle motion of the tree branches, marveling at the way things made up of light could still cast shadows when silhouetted by the harsher light of the sun.
 Only somehow the sun had disappeared, replaced by the paler, colder light of the moon.
 The trees were still graceful strands of light, but the breeze had changed to a harsh thing, one carrying new scents that somehow represented danger.
 Something inside me forced my limbs into motion.
 I was running before the first howl tore through the night.
 I was moving unimaginably fast, jumping fallen trees and bounding over other obstacles which even my improved vision struggled to make out in time for me to avoid them.
 The speed of my passage wrung tears from my eyes, but I didn't dare slow.
 They were back there, four of them moving with speed only slightly less than my own, noses to the ground to follow my scent, save for the moments in which they let loose their unearthly howls.
 A flicker of motion up ahead should have made me pull up in fear, but the smell accompanying it was somehow familiar, somehow safe.
 I knew if I could reach the shadowy person I'd been unconsciously following, I'd be safe, but he was so incredibly fast and my pursuers were gaining.

“Want to try a weapon?” I was pretty sure I didn’t, give how much the weaponless training hurt.
 I procrastinated.
 “Why use arrows if you have magic?” She had that ‘Frey, you’re an idiot’ look again.
 “Magic uses more energy the farther away you try to focus it.
 And it is less accurate.
 And you are more visible.
 And—” I held up a hand.
 “All right, I have it.” She smiled.
 “Any more questions or can we begin?” “Fine.
 What sort of weapon did you have in mind?” Her smile widened.

"Rick!"
 She could hear him hurrying toward her, and she turned to meet him.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart," he said, hugging her close.
 Tears rolled down her cheeks, and she choked back a sob.
 She missed her mother.
 She loved television and the microwave and blue jeans, but she wanted to exclaim over them with her mother.
 And she wanted to cuddle up next to Davis as they watched television together.
 Her father would buy them one.
 Well, if there were televisions in 1927, he would.
 Maybe she should see if she could carry one back.

The continued build-up of nuclear arsenals was an attempt by the superpowers to maintain parity or superiority over each other as a deterrent against being attacked.
 Although the nuclear powers may argue that their arsenals have protected them from any such danger, there is little rationality in a strategy that compelled adversaries continuously to take steps to offset each other’s measures, without either party actually achieving greater real security.
 In addition, this strategy was pursued at the cost of increasing insecurity to other nations.
 The acquisition of nuclear weapons generates a ripple effect and acts as a powerful force for proliferation.
 The arms build-up has been reversed, but at least 40,000 nuclear weapons are still in stockpiles with a combined explosive force at least 1,000 times greater than all the firepower used in all the wars since the introduction of gunpowder six hundred years ago.
 START-I and START-II will bring down the number of warheads of the United States and the former Soviet Union by 90 per cent from a combined 55,500 total to 6,500 over a ten-year period.
 But this reduction could, in fact, be achieved within months rather than years by deactivating delivery systems and separating their warheads, which could then be stored under multilateral control.
 Nor do these agreements, long overdue and greatly welcome, remove the fundamental dangers and questionable legitimacy of these weapons.
 Even without a decision to abandon completely their use under any circumstances, a further drastic reduction to somewhere between 20 and 200 warheads is more than sufficient to meet any security need.
 Immediate steps can, and should, be taken to negotiate reductions to this minimum level.

“Know it before I send you to the abyss.”
 He fired two arrows, one for each eye.
 They shattered into fire, and finally blood did flow.
 It ran down the dead flesh and bone that was his face, over his black robes, and pooled in the grass below.
 He fell prone, still screaming his anger and fury.
 For five hundred years he had walked the land of Dezrel.
 All that time, all those killings, and this was how he would fail.
 “Karak!” he shouted, all his power fleeing him.
 His undead minions collapsed, their souls released.
 The gates to the abyss opened before his eyes, and he felt the pull on his soul.

I tried to figure it out, and it seems like the best time would be in September.
 But I can’t wait until September!
 And what if that book isn’t right?” Rick hugged Marie, wiping away her tears.
 He led her inside and made her breakfast, which she barely touched.
 Nothing he said drew much of a response from her.
 He hated leaving her when she was so upset, but after a week’s vacation, he had a ton of work at the office.
 “Call me if you need anything, sweetheart,” he told her, kissing the top of her head just before he left.
 Marie watched him leave and then, with a sigh, rose and went to the living room, still wearing her 1927 clothes.
 She’d tried so hard to get back this morning.
 She’d worn only her 1927 clothes, and her mind hadn’t wandered to 2011 at all.

Blood ran from a busted lip.
 The skin on his cheek was already blackening.
 “I don’t know what just happened,” she said, the quiver in her voice belying her calm speech.
 “But I know I don’t like it and will not accept it.
 Ever.
 Is that clear?”
 “Yeah,” Harruq said.
 “Now will you let me down?”
 For a moment, she said nothing, catching her breath and doing her best to calm the flood of adrenaline that still rushed through her.
 Harruq twisted against the vines, but they still held firm.

 “It’s the public art piece we use to climb.” “That makes sense.” She paused.
 “I have to go, dinner.” “Bye Emily,” I whispered.
 “See you tomorrow.” “Bye.” She clicked off.

He fluffed it up but the dirt was still stuck in globs.
 I rolled my eyes at his attempts.
 I turned around to see an entrance.
 I walked over and bent down.
 There seemed to be some kind of sign or symbol.
 It was two circles with a sword through the center of both.
 “Seth, look!” I said and pointed to it.
 He came over and bent down, tracing the sign with his finger.
 I waited and finally said, “Well, do you know what it is?” Seth dropped his finger.
 “It means, 'slayer of worlds'.

 Velixar nodded.
 “Indeed, Harruq.

Not just for the job, but for smoothing things over with the bank as well.
 I wish there was some way I could repay you for everything.
 --Adriana Chapter 7 My alarm clock jerked me out of a thankfully dream-free slumber.
 Actually, as I pulled myself out of bed I realized I'd had a virtual torrent of dreams, but none of them had been possessed of the strange vividness that'd begun haunting my waking moments.
 I hadn't had one of the special dreams, ergo I hadn't had any dreams last night.
 I really needed to get out of this town before whatever was in the water drove me completely crazy.
 Actually, I probably didn't have much time in which to affect my escape.
 When it came to craziness I was already halfway there.
 After all, I'd already been diagnosed with the kind of clinical condition nobody with less than eight years of school could even pronounce.
 As amusing as my internal monologue was, I didn't let it slow my normal morning preparations.

I had to find out what was wrong, and soon.
 “Jazell, are you paying attention?” Emily’s annoyed voice broke my day dreams.
 I snapped back to attention, “Uh yes, I am Emily.
 Just for the record, what are we talking about?” “Jazell you’re hopeless!
 We’re talking about what to do next,” she scowled.
 “Wait,” an idea jumped into my head, “how about we meet under a truce.” Emily stared at me.
 “A truce?
 Seriously?
 That is the complete opposite of what we’re doing.” “I know but trust me; we need to meet under a truce.
 What about monster fighting and this whole puzzle with the dwarfs?

 “I read it again after you came here, and it had changed.
 Now it just gives general information about your family and your birth.
 It doesn’t mention your death or-or anything about marriage or children.”  He paused.
 “I thought that maybe .

 maybe that’s because coming here would change all that.” She blinked, trying to absorb what he was telling her.
 Her life was already on record?

 "Well, there are still movies and lovers and excitement, but I wouldn't call it romantic."

 He stood up, taking her hands.

 He hugged her, murmuring, "We won't give up.
 And one morning when you least expect it, you'll walk back into your own garden."
 Marie closed her eyes, drawing strength from Rick.
 She just hoped he was right.
 And she hoped it would happen soon.
 After Rick had left for work, Marie walked on the treadmill for nearly 45 minutes and then made herself a cup of tea.

Van’dret spread his hands and made a frantic move that sent a corona of power around him.
 Of course no focused magic came near him, and what did occur startled even Rodregas.
 Imeralda was literally flying through the air and she had her dagger drawn.
 She did not land smoothly, colliding into Van’dret’s lower body, but she instantly straightened and thrust her dagger into Van’dret’s stomach.
 The dagger did not sink far; a few inches.
 Rodregas expected Van’dret to get his hands up and fend her off, but he seemed to be in shock.
 Imeralda pulled the dagger out and then viscously stuck it back in the sorcerer, her body moved with the stroke, clearly using every ounce of strength she had.
 Still the blade only stuck in a few inches, but Van’dret screamed and fell to the floor and started to drag himself away.
 As soon as the surprisingly high pitch of Van’dret scream sounded, both Doi’van’s and Rodregas’ feet were free.
 Rodregas stumbled for a moment, but was running almost, even as he caught himself.

She managed to doze a little but was wide awake before dawn.
 Deciding to do an aerobics tape until it was light enough to walk in the garden, she put on her workout clothes and went downstairs.
 She didn't know how she was going to be able to wait two entire days.
 She was so excited that she felt like she could run all the way to Hollywood.
 After 45 minutes of aerobics, she still wasn't tired!
 She wouldn't be able to sit still and watch TV today.
 She'd do all their laundry and clean the house from top to bottom and have dinner ready when Rick got home.
 She glanced at her watch and decided to get everything ready for breakfast so that it wouldn't take long to cook it for Rick as soon as they got back from her walk.
 She froze in place.
 What if she got back to 1927 today?

I wasn't sure whether I helped because I was feeling guilty, or because I was worried Brandon would show up before she'd left.
 Maybe I was just hoping to kill two birds with one stone.
 It wasn't until she was finally in the Jeep and backing down our lane that I finally stopped worrying that Brandon was going to pop around the corner.
 He'd been smugly confident he wouldn't show up before she was gone, but had refused to tell me how he planned on pulling up at my house five minutes after the coast was clear.
 Half of me was strongly tempted to dawdle for fifteen or twenty minutes, but with my luck he'd really manage to show up within the next few minutes, and I'd have to scramble to get ready while he waited for me.
 With a sigh I ran up to the bathroom, brushed my teeth, gave my hair the once-over, and grabbed a light jacket as I left my room.
 It wasn't even remotely as cold here as I would be at home by this late in the year, but the oppressive heat had finally started to wane a little.
 Knowing my luck, if I left it home tonight would be the first time it snowed in Sanctuary in the last two centuries.
 More and more excited about the prospect of going to my first real party, I bounced down the stairs and into the kitchen for a drink.
 I happened to look out the window as I pulled a glass out of the cupboard, and nearly dropped it when I saw Brandon leaning against his car, patiently waiting for me.

Rodregas nodded.
 The pain was easier to manage knowing that at least he was still in the running for the tournament championship.
 Imeralda stepped into his sight shaking her head, “You men are crazy sometimes; you actually look pleased!
 If your armor had not held you would be dead now.
 And it is not like you are fighting someone who deserves to die.
 Most of these men are honorable warriors.” Rodregas nodded.
 “True, hopefully another day of this though and we will be back to fighting those we should be fighting, and it will be far harder to stop me if I achieve a greater sigil.” Imeralda crouched down, she had a very serious expression on her face, and Rodregas had a sense that he was not going to like what she said next.
 “Rodregas,” she said slowly, “we are not doing this for vanity right?” Rodregas nodded, he sensed she knew the answer to the question but was going somewhere with the question.
 She looked around to make sure others in the arena could not overhear.
 “We attacked a slave caravan simply because there were children and innocents that needed rescuing though the odds were against us.” Rodregas nodded again.

Jim – But why did you do it?
 Liz – It just seemed to fit into the whole mood of the conversation.
 Jim – BAH!
 You people won’t open your eyes until people in Palm Beach are drinking beer watching hockey and saying Eh.
 Will you?
 The whole world is full of blind fools who laugh at anyone who can see the truth and dare to talk about what they see.
 Liz – I think some people in Flordia already drink beer and watch hockey, dunno about how often they say Eh though.
 Jim – That ain’t funny.
 Liz – I’m serious, Hockey is popular all over the country.

While he had been living on less since his home lock-down, he was really never clean during this detox.
 How was Brandon going to achieve what these cops wanted in his condition and with his new reputation as a snitch?
 I am the father, with all that that means.
 I am the man of the family, and I would do anything to protect my family but I was in unchartered territory here once again.
 What would Dino NOT do?
 What would Richard NOT do?
 I looked the undercover narcotics officer in the face and blurted, “I’ll do the bust!” I’m raising my freaking hand like I am volunteering to coach a soccer team.
 I believe firmly that the deal to bust Steve should be forgiven due to the failure on the part of the police and the complete and total fiasco that had come from the officers not doing their homework and giving Brandon the same number that Steve already knew was an undercover cop’s phone.
 They have pushed me into a corner and I only see one absurd way out.
 “We don’t let parents work off deals to keep their kids out of prison,” Officer White responded after several moments of silent staring around the room.

“This city has long been treated neutral, even though it resides within Neldar’s border.
 The elves will not take kindly to removal from a home many have lived in since before our dear king’s grandparents were alive.”
 “I eagerly await the bloodshed,” Qurrah said.
 He bowed to his master.
 “Go.
 The night is young.
 Taint the dreams of the slumbering.”
 Qurrah left Velixar to sit alone before the fire.
 The dark night sang a song of crickets and wind.
 In the quiet, Dieredon entered the light of the fire.

My earlier commitment to rededicate myself to school notwithstanding, the weekend hadn't exactly been conducive to mastering the intricacies of our latest subject.
 Her smile was wide indeed by the time the bell finally released me to flee in defeat and embarrassment.
 Alec paced me all the way back to my locker.
 "Is that normal for her?"
 I started to laugh, only to cut the motion short as I realized there was a better than even chance I'd end up crying instead.
 I settled for just nodding as I swapped books and slammed my locker shut.
 Alec pursed his lips for a second and then nodded, not at me, but at whatever decision he'd just made.
 "We'd better get you to your next class.
 Dealing with that will have to wait until later."
 I wanted to ask what he meant, but the halls were already full of other students, and I was pretty sure he'd tell me when he was ready and not a moment sooner anyways.

“Come on.
 I have an idea.”
 He grabbed Qurrah’s arm and hooked his elbow around it.
 Qurrah was too weak to complain, so together they ran down the streets.
 They passed closed homes containing people praying for safety and victory.
 Looming ahead of them was the southern gate.
 Hundreds of soldiers stacked against it, their shields braced and ready.
 All along the walls, archers released arrow after arrow into the darkness.
 “How are we to get closer?” Qurrah asked.
 “Ignore them,” Harruq said.

 Harruq stormed through the village, roaring for any to stand and fight.
 “We’re coming for you,” he shouted, his voice like the growl of a dog.
 “You are weak!
 Weak!”
 The cry of a child sent him bashing through the door of a small home.
 Inside, a girl huddled beside her much younger sister.
 They were wrapped in blankets.
 The little girl clutched a doll in her hands.

They were able to briefly incapacitate the wolves, giving Rhys and Rider less warning of their approach before you were attacked.” He hesitated.
 “When we heard the alert, I turned.
 Your eyes were closed.” I didn’t comment, so he continued, “I was able to catch you just before your horse dropped.
 I’ve no idea why they attacked him.
 They should have been focused on you.” I wasn’t sure they had attacked the horse.
 Maybe it was because I’d been there, in his mind, controlling him.
 “What happened to Rhys and Rider?” “They broke to keep from fighting such a sizeable force alone.
 They circled back to meet us.
 In the disorder, they lost track of the wolves.” “But the wolves weren’t hurt?” “They had been strung up by vine among the trees, but alive.” I winced at the idea.
 “Why?” A wry smile crossed his lips and I couldn’t help but focus on them for a moment.

It might have little practical effect, but he knew that while a greater sigil might make him a great fighter and that while fighting was necessary, it had no real inherent value.
 It simply made one better at fighting.
 Somehow he knew the blessing was inherently a positive thing.
 He remembered on hot sunny days as a kid the wonderful pleasure of lying under a tree when the city would be so hot in the summer, but in the shade of the tree it was just perfect.
 It was a random thought, but a good one.
 Doi’van interrupted his memory by asking a question.
 So like Doi’van, always thinking, Rodregas thought with a smile.
 “So first I make my infernal side more structured and then I become a part Nymph, a strange combination for a Hellborn.” Rodregas said, “I think we both feel the importance of the blessing and I thank you for sharing it.” She nodded and said, “I am so happy that I decided to go with you to sneak in, otherwise I would never have been able to receive the blessing of the One Tree.
 No matter how successful we are now against the Immortalists, I have been blessed as few of my people have.” Imeralda looked like she wanted to talk and Rodregas hated to break the mood, but they needed to get back to business.
 “We should return to the main chamber.

What if you kissed me so hard that-that my teeth cut my lips?
 What if--" "I would never, ever hurt you."
 He caressed her hair.
 "If I ever do anything that hurts you or that you don't like, tell me, and I'll stop.
 Right away.
 I care about you, Marie, and I'd rather never kiss you again than hurt you."
 She laid her head on his shoulder again.
 She believed him.

Seth smiled sheepishly.
 “Jazell, you should just relax.
 Let them bicker all they want; we don't have to be a part of it.
 Get some sleep.” My mind was still slow, trying to process why he was holding my hand.
 I blinked and nodded.
 “Alright but if it starts getting crazy, wake me up.” “Wake you up?” he asked and laughed.
 “I'm sleeping too.
 If it gets crazy, they'll wake us up.” “Okay,” I said and yawned.
 I leaned my head against the tree and closed my eyes.
 The world seemed to fade around me, along with the bickering and Seth's hand, as I fell asleep.

Vincent overreached in his effort to claim the kill, and I sunk my teeth into the muscled flesh of his shoulder as I finally made it around behind him.
 My claws sank into his arms and legs as I repositioned to snap his neck, and then a hammer blow of weight struck me across the shoulders.
 Knocked loose from Vincent, I spun around in time to tear Simon from the air as he leaped at me again.
 It was the perfect opportunity to end a life nearly as evil as Vincent's, but one of the recent arrivals had bowled Jasmin over.
 Leveraging a frame that was more than capable of picking up a small car, I threw Simon into the whirling ball of flesh and fangs.
 He didn't hit hard enough to snap his neck, but he knocked the other wolf off of Jasmin, and then Vincent was back on his feet.
 The rest of the rival pack, save for Brandon their leader, came streaming past, but they didn't help their fellows swarm Jasmin and me over.
 None of them even slowed.
 Vincent took an angry swipe at the last, a small female, and then our pack burst from the trees.
 A second later, our enemies were in full rout.

Bountiful gardens were replaced by weeds and thorns.
 Hurt and betrayed, the Sun distanced herself from the Earth, lessening the number of life-giving rays warming his surface.
 Possibly that was his plan.
 If she'd totally abandoned him then her children would've all died."
 I felt my eyelids begin to flutter, as my breathing slowed to match Alec's.
 "Whether that was his intent or not, the Sun didn't completely abandon him, either out of respect for what they'd shared, or possibly out of concern for her children.
 Once it became apparent that the Earth and Sun were through with each other, the Moon began to court her.
 Doomed to touch only briefly during the rare solar eclipses, they nevertheless became beloved, one to the other.
 The greatest sign of the Moon's devotion to the Sun came about when he sent his children down to the Earth to watch over and protect the sunborn, or dayborn as they are most often called."
 Alec's pause was long enough that I think I nodded off, but the sound of his voice once he resumed talking pulled me back awake.

 “What are they looking at?” Harruq later asked as the two brothers walked down the winding streets of Woodhaven.
 “Let us see,” said Qurrah.
 Harruq muscled his way past two men, his brother following in his wake.
 They found a proclamation nailed to a post.
 “What’s it say?” Harruq asked.
 “All children are to be kept outside the boundary of the forest,” Qurrah said, his eyes narrowing.
 “Six have been killed by the…”
 Qurrah laughed, a hideous sound.
 “By the what?” Harruq asked.

Brandon stood surrounded by his friends on one side of the circle, with Alec and a smaller group standing opposite them.
 The tension in the room was like the air before a lightning strike, charged and unpredictable, a living organism on the point of materializing out of thin air and attacking anything surrounding it.
 Taking in the two groups, I was amazed at the disparity before my eyes.
 The kids behind Brandon were half again as many as the gathering behind Alec, and they were eager for the confrontation, watching with excited eyes, and large smiles.
 Alec's company on the other hand awaited the coming fight with calm exteriors and a sense they were bowing before the inevitable conflict without conceding anything to their opponents.
 They were fewer in number, but the men were larger than anyone other than Alec or Brandon, and I somehow knew even the girls were dangerous.
 With a sudden start I realized the confrontation wasn't between Brandon and Alec as I'd originally thought.
 Instead the stuck-up blonde I'd first met in the office, was squared off against a brunette less than three-quarters her size.
 As Britney pulled us even closer, almost into the dead zone between the two factions, I finally realized the smaller girl was Rachel.

 But you don't need any money.

 "No.

 He stood up, taking her hand.
 "It'll be payment for the history lesson."

 But she didn't recognize the interior at all.

It was all so crazy.
 Two weeks ago my life had revolved around my inability to think of certain things without collapsing.
 That hadn't changed, but now there was a distinct possibility Jasmin was going to hurt me just to ensure I stayed silent.
 Oh, and I was actually considering opening myself up for some very nasty ridicule, just on the infinitesimally slim chance a boy who was so popular, rich, and gorgeous that he shouldn't even know my name might be interested in me.
 Life was supposed to get better as you got older, but it was starting to look like it just got more complicated.
 Just before I looked back down at the shiny aluminum of my now-naked can, Brandon looked up and caught my eye.
 The smile on his face seemed to say all kinds of things.
 I'm sorry I can't come over and talk.
 They all really depend on me.
 This whole thing with Jasmin is really crazy; we've got to figure out how best to handle it.

He finally went out to the garden.
 She was way over by the pink roses, and he was surprised and dismayed to see her wearing her 1927 clothes.
 "Marie!"
 He ran over to her, but something about her stance when she looked up at him kept him from sweeping her into his arms like he wanted.
 "What are you doing?"
 he asked.
 She shrugged.
 "Trying to get home."
 His heart plummeted.
 "Why didn't you come tell me?"

I hid myself behind a patch of brush to watch him.
 He had a lovely complexion with a hint of bronze and cropped dark brown hair with a few tiny streaks of blond just around his face.
 He looked less like the others I had been watching.
 He was built like the elves, strong and muscled, but still lean.
 He wore plain pants and tall boots.
 His light cloth shirt moved around him as he walked, unlaced at the chest.
 He carried a small blade in his hand, but I couldn’t imagine what he was doing here unaccompanied.
 There was a rustle from the brush several yards in the opposite direction I was hiding.
 He rushed toward it and I followed, unsure why he was running.
 The noise was made by a small boar and the human was chasing it.

While he seemed calm, the man in black did not miss how his eyes still refused to meet his.
 “Give me time,” Qurrah said.
 “Let me make sure he is ready.”
 “Is he not open to Karak?” Velixar asked.
 “He is open,” Qurrah said a bit too vehemently.
 A glare from Velixar calmed him before he continued.
 “My brother can be a mindless butcher, but he must be angered or spurned into battle.
 When peaceful, his mind entertains ideas that run…‌ contrary to what he and I are.”
 “And what is that, Qurrah?
 What are you and your brother?”

No problem, I said.
 In my heart, Billy Torrey was my little brother, and would be for years to come.
 We would play music and perform together in a coffee house, until he married and moved away.
 Not long after our one date, Serena died in a car crash.
 I didn’t go to her funeral.
 I hadn’t minded her snitching to Liz.
 She was a sweet girl, and Liz was her friend.
 But I had seen too many funerals.
 Then Billy Graham came to town.

 Karen – I’ve seen a couple of pictures, she isn’t.
 Art – Stay in Russia and have no foreseeable future, or come to the United States and marry a stranger who just happens to turn out to be a contributor to the growth of the lesbian community.
 I wonder what would happen to the poor man if she decided to go back to Russia as a lesbian.
 Karen – I don’t know, I hope it never happens to him, my family would make his life hell if they ever found out.
 Art – A good reason to stay away from them.
 I haven’t seen much of my family in years, those people are nuts.
 They’re bizarre on the odd days as well as the even.
 That and a rift opened between us about my wife.
 I found that I preferred her company over that of my family.

Mrs. Campbell looked up when I reached her desk.
 "Here's your form, among other things."
 I verified that the top sheet had her signature on it, and then turned to go.
 She didn't let me get very far.
 "From your bewildered expression during class it appears you aren't transferring in from another school.
 I expect most of your other teachers are just letting you pick up from where they are now.
 I'm afraid this class builds on itself, so I'll be testing you on everything we've covered in the past month.
 I'm sure you've got a full class load, but we haven't gotten into anything truly difficult yet.
 The sooner we get you caught up, the better off you'll be.

 And to be able to have access to it, well there wasn’t any practical way to really keep it out of the hands of anyone who actually bothered to look.

 Jim – Dad could almost start his own shop with what he’s got so far.

I pulled back the string, and then stopped.
 I couldn’t take out one of these like, this unless I set it on fire.
 But Emily wasn’t here.
 I could take it out with a few arrows but it’s best to kill Thrashers before they realize you’re there.
 Instead I lowered my bow and slowly crept up to it, until I could see the hideous claws on its hands and the hatred in its eyes.
 Thrashers hate everything and sometimes I wonder how they tolerate each other.
 I aimed for the head again and released the arrow.
 It whizzed silently into the thrasher and it howled in pain as the arrow dug into its fur.
 It whirled around, facing me.
 A low growl sounded in its throat and it charged.

 Jim – And you still did it?
 Johnny – Of course!
 Liz – Where did you get the Dodo’s blood?
 Johnny – I didn’t actually use Dodo blood.
 Liz – Why not?

When I was by myself, it was hard to believe it all hadn't been a dream.
 Thursday morning flew by, it was like I blinked and it was already time for Mrs. Campbell's class.
 A number of the other girls, and even a couple of the guys, stopped by my desk before the bell rang to congratulate me on winning the last ticket to Les Misérables.
 Britney wasn't one of them.
 I caught her glaring at me a couple of times out of the corner of my eye.
 Under normal circumstances I probably would've felt guilty, or at least wished things had worked out differently.
 Today, I was fully prepared to acknowledge Britney as the spoiled, self-centered brat she was.
 The bell rang and then Mrs. Campbell's lecture was over in record time.
 I even finished my assignment a good ten minutes before class was scheduled to end.
 I was absently sketching what I expected the inside of the opera house to look like, when a tap on my shoulder pulled me out of my reverie.

But this is the type of understanding and perspective needed by governments and international agencies today to formulate effective policy measures in an interdependent world.
 Cooperative Security
 Eliminating nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles and small arms proliferation are practical measures whose time has come.
 But by themselves these steps will only mitigate the most pernicious threats to international security.
 They will not provide an effective system for ensuring the peace and security of all nations that is so vitally needed, and now so imminently possible, as a basis for accelerating the political, economic and social development of humankind.
 The end of the Cold War provides us with the opportunity, and pressing global issues provide the urgency, for more significant measures.
 These measures cannot be conceived within the perspective of international security that has dominated our thinking in the post-war period, or from a half-hearted desire to modestly improve what to some still appears an adequate and acceptable system.
 This is an occasion that demands visionary and courageous leadership to usher in a better world.
 The children of the next millennium will judge us by our response.
 Historically, all landmark changes in the international political and security system have been the result of armed conflicts, wars and revolutions.

Apparently Alec was the only hard-core party animal in the class.
 I was still feeling weird from Britney's story, so unlike the rest of my classmates, who seemed genuinely intrigued by the assignment, I just pretended to leaf through a reference book all hour.
 Spanish was as bad as history.
 Mrs. Tiggs turned on one of the Spanish TV channels within thirty seconds of class starting.
 Towards the end of the hour I finally started to come back out of my funk, so I put the last few minutes to good use reviewing vocabulary for the quiz on Tuesday.
 I felt a momentary surge of relief when class ended, but the feeling evaporated when I remembered I had to go to math tutoring.
 I grabbed my math book, and met an equally morose Britney at her locker.
 There are only so many times one person can say something sucks, and expect the other person to agree with them.
 Britney quickly used up her allotment of complaints, and then subsided into silence as she led the way to an out-of-the-way corner of the old school.
 I'd noticed Britney liked to position herself so she was closest to the middle of the hall.

"Goodnight, Rick."
 She gave him a quick smile before slipping into her room.
 Rick's smile had become a frown by the time he was in his own room.
 He wasn't sure this trip was such a good idea after all.
 Sharing her dream was going to make him fall even more deeply in love with her.
 And when she left, he'd be devastated.
 But remembering the excitement on her face as she'd danced with the actor, he couldn't regret it.
 The next day they went to Universal Studios.
 "This is set up like an amusement park," Rick told her as he bought their tickets.
 "So even if it isn't authentic, I think you'll enjoy it."

Rodregas headed back to Doi’van who said, “I don’t think that technique is what the knights had in mind.” His voice showed his personal pleasure, knowing that a move he had taught Rodregas lead to his victory.
 Rodregas nodded and said, “Decided that my advantage of strength was being matched by armor and steed, so it was time to use agility.
 I was not sure it would work.” “It will be harder the next time.
 Good luck,” Doi’van said.
 Rodregas’ next opponent for the joust was riding a powerful war steed and was in the dark non-reflective brown of full Night Bronze armor.
 Rodregas recognized the simple gray banner of Geriodon.
 His arm was decorated with the ribbons of his accomplishments in the tournament to date.
 As the flag fell it seemed like Geriodon was half way to Rodregas before Doom Hoof started to move.
 Rodregas knew that the only way he would be able to dodge the lance was if his timing was perfect.
 He raised himself up as the lance lowered down and dodged to the right.

The Helsinki Process, the Stockholm Document, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Warsaw Treaty’s adoption of the doctrine of ‘non-offensive defence’, and most recently the UN Secretary General’s Agenda for Peace – all give highest priority to war prevention.
 While welcome, these incremental measures do not fully recognize either the extent of the danger of the continued application of violence to achieve political ends or the extent of the opportunity which the end of the Cold War has brought for radically altering the way in which humanity settles domestic and international disputes.
 There was a time when war could be justified as a necessary expedient.
 Now the potential human and economic costs of even limited terrorist war – especially if it involves the use of nuclear or biological weapons, but even otherwise – are so great that the risks are no longer tolerable.
 Because the potential risks far outweigh the possible advantages of continued reliance on this means of achieving national and international security, war has become obsolete as an instrument of policy.
 At the same time, there is no longer an insurmountable political conflict within the UN system to prevent all member countries from agreeing to a total ban on the use of violence against each other.
 It is time for the UN to declare war itself a crime against humanity and to ban from membership any nation that engages in aggression against another.
 Even if this intention cannot immediately be made effective, the adoption of this Peace Imperative would mark a milestone in human affairs.
 There is no rational or practical obstacle to the immediate adoption of this measure.
 As a starting point, it can be demonstrated that with the right perspective, courage and commitment, practical immediate solutions are possible for any and all of the conflicts presently raging.

 (Jim holds up the Groucho glasses disguise from earlier).
 Art -  What are you doing with those ridiculous things?
 Jim – Just a precaution.
 Couldn’t she have gone out of town with him?
 Are they still fighting?
 (Puts on the glasses)
 Liz –They’re still fighting.
 Jim take those off, you look like an idiot.
 Jim – I thought that they had started getting along better over the last couple of months.

“You’re alright!” Harruq hugged him.
 Qurrah laughed.
 “He lost,” he said, pointing to the night sky.
 “And he doesn’t know how badly.”
 One by one, the skulls’ fire went out and they fell like morbid hail upon the city.
 “Limitless,” Qurrah said, his smile trembling.
 Blood ran from his nose, and his skin was so pale Harruq could see his veins.
 “The well is limitless.”
 His eyes rolled into his head.
 Without another word, he collapsed.

Cleo – Where do you get off speaking to me like that?
 Liz – Oh I just guess I wasn’t raised very well, my mother spent so much of her time sleeping with the gardener and her tennis instructor.
 Cleo – I never did anything, those are all lies made up by your father to turn you against me!
 I never touched either of those men.
 I was faithful to your father!
 Liz – I have pictures.
 Cleo – You little sneak!
 Well your father has been cheating on me too, with his secretaries, since just a little while after you were born.
 Liz – I’ve got pictures of that as well.
 It all makes for a wonderful family album to show my children one day.

"Yeah."
 She looked at his arms with concern.
 "How does your sunburn feel?"
 she asked him.
 "Still a little sore.
 I should have put some lotion on this morning."
 "Go do it now."
 "I'm feeling too lazy."
 "Tell me where it is, and I'll get it for you."
 Following his instructions, she went to his bathroom and got the lotion.

"I'll have my lawyer send you the papers, Mr. Lawson," Jefferson Tranton said.
 He showed his guest out and then returned to kiss his daughter's cheek before sitting down behind his desk.
 "You look lovely this morning, my dear."
 "Thank you.
 I didn't mean to interrupt.
 I didn't think you were going to be doing business at home this morning."
 "Young Lawson is eager to close the deal as quickly as possible.
 Says he's going to build two houses on that property.
 Not a good location for houses, in my opinion, but who can tell young people anything these days?
 I hear that he bought two other pieces of land last month.

I laughed, shocked at myself, but filled with excitement and amusement.
 He stood, whirling to face me, bloody blade held out.
 I had to stifle another laugh.
 I managed to keep my reaction calm, only a smile.
 He seemed disoriented for a moment and then his breathing slowed and his arms relaxed.
 He stared at me as if I were a delusion, a dream looking back at him.
 He was speechless and it occurred to me that perhaps elves were not a part of this human’s knowledge.
 I wondered if he would recover soon.
 I considered abandoning him and returning to watch the others, but his face was so interesting, the emotions so plain and readable there.
 But he wasn’t afraid.

Want it more than anything else."
 That wasn't completely true.
 I wanted him to kiss me even more than I wanted to go to the Ashure Day Dance.
 Having him touch me in other ways was pretty high on the list too, but maybe that was just psychosomatic.
 He didn't need to know that.
 I really did want to spend time with him.
 Even if he wasn't going to touch me, being with him was better than being anywhere else.
 "This is a mistake.
 The worst kind of mistake because we both know it's wrong and we don't care."
 "I don't think it's a mistake.

He also handed Audrian a few of his coins.
 It wasn’t much, but it would get them started; they were lucky he was being so generous.
 Rodregas felt he owed them, and if he had been in their place he would have tried to kill Ravenhurr.
 Clearly the three human men were eager to get started back to the main road.
 He noticed that the Hellborn Doi’van and Imeralda seemed to be hanging back.
 As the three men started to head down the road Doi’van walked up to Rodregas and stated, “I would rather travel with you.” That was it; he just stood there like some huge tree after that simple statement.
 Audrian seemed as surprised as he was.
 They both spoke at the same time, their thoughts strangely in agreement.
 “Are you crazy?” asked Audrian at the same time as Rodregas said, “That is crazy.” “Look, the Guild will be after me,” Rodregas stated.
 “It will not be safe to travel in my company,” he added.

“The first Horde War was caused by a disciple of mine,” the man in black explained.
 “He blessed the armor of one of the leaders of the orcish clans.
 I claimed it when he fell on the battlefield.”
 Harruq examined the suit, turning it over in his hands.
 It was composed of many interwoven straps of thick leather.
 Obsidian buckles and clamps held the pieces together.
 The only color was a yellow scorpion emblazoned on the chest.
 “Why the scorpion?” he asked.
 “The orcs have forgotten Karak, whom they once served.
 They worship animals as their gods, believing they take strength from them.

As amazing as James' and Isaac's tuxes were, I was already looking past them, craning my neck to see down the hall in a vain effort to catch a glimpse of Alec.
 There was no reason for my heart to be pounding away so furiously in my chest, but unlikely or not, my body at least seemed convinced he was going to change his mind and leave me standing here by myself.
 Rachel looked up from her conversation with Jasmin just long enough to give me a reassuring smile, and then I heard the barest whisper of sound.
 I spun around with a speed that gave lie to all of my pathetic attempts to pretend like I hadn't been worried.
 Alec was standing in the doorway, having crossed the distance down the hall faster than I would've believed possible, appearing almost as if by sorcery.
 His shoes were every bit as shiny as James', leading up to slacks that could've been mistaken for shiny, but were actually something else, something with more depth than anything I'd seen before.
 The coat was made out of the same material, tailored tightly enough it managed to emphasize rather than conceal his massive shoulders and chest.
 His pocket square matched his bow-tie, both of which were the exact shade of green used on my dress.
 It wasn't a masculine color by almost any standard, but he made it his, and there wasn't anything about him that could be described as anything other than manly.
 Having stalled as long as I could, I finally looked up past his perfect lips and met his twinkling eyes.

Say them.
 Say them and live.
 My life for you, _Qurrah shouted as the world crystallized.
 A red line slashed across his mind, and as the dream shattered into shards the words of the dark man ripped through him._
 Then come reap the rewards.
 Qurrah lurched awake, gasping for air.
 His throat ached, and he could feel the tiniest trickle of blood down his trachea.
 The night was still deep and the town quiet.
 Beside him, Harruq snored loud enough to wake the drunkest of men.
 Far away, a wolf howl beckoned.

I didn't quite manage to avoid twisting my ankle though, so I limped all the way up to the second floor.
 Trying to be as casual as possible, I looked into the art room as I hobbled by, but they'd rearranged their stations, and someone's easel was in the way now.
 The sprained ankle had slowed me down enough that there was no way I was going to make it back to my locker before the bell rang.
 Still, I tried to be gracious when it went off just as I handed Mrs. North the papers.
 Based on the number of classrooms on the second floor, and the narrowness of the stairs, there was no point in trying to wait the crowd out.
 I gritted my teeth and limped out into the surge of bodies.
 Surprisingly enough, there were more familiar faces than expected.
 As I grabbed the handrail on the right, I noticed Isaac several feet ahead of me.
 Of course, it's hard to miss someone nearly six feet tall and almost as well-muscled as Alec.
 Even if he was partially hidden by Vincent, who was strutting along a little higher up the stairs with all of his usual arrogance.

Not that I could remember him, but I could definitely blame him because the father was always responsible for naming the firstborn.
 It wasn’t as if you could get more unoriginal than using the ancient word meaning “elf”, but he certainly hadn’t needed to follow it with a string of ridiculous, flowery—I stopped mid-thought, realizing my tutor was watching me.
 “Hey, Junnie,” I said, forcing a smile.
 “What’s on the schedule for today?” She smiled in return, straightening the deep blue sash that tied her tunic.
 “How do you feel about studying the lineages?” She knew I hated trying to memorize endless pages of names and dates, and didn’t seem surprised by my groan of complaint.
 “Well, let’s get to it then,” she said, leading me through the tiny living area toward the back room.
 She didn’t have or need a great deal of space.
 Much like me, Junnie was practically alone.
 Her family had all received the calling “to serve elfkind.” I didn’t know exactly what that meant, only that the elf usually left with fanfare and seldom returned in fewer than a hundred years.
 It was apparently a very honorable thing, though she never seemed proud.

But with the memory of Korin breaking Jorin’s neck, adrenaline pounded in his new arms.
 This was justice long overdue.
 With a quick movement of his arms and the haunting memory of the sounds of crunching and popping from all those years ago, he twisted Korin’s head nearly all the way around.
 Rodregas held his body as it spasmed wildly for a moment.
 Then the Adapt went still and limp; and Rodregas dropped him to the floor.
 Korin’s’ body hit the floor and started to empty itself.
 “Gods,” he thought and asked out loud to no one, “What did he eat this morning?” He grabbed the body and dragged it into the water closet and dropped it into the small bronze tub.
 Rodregas started to leave and then saw Korin’s purse; the Adapt was dressed for travel and Rodregas had yet to find even a single coin in the Master’s chambers.
 He reached down and took the purse off his belt.
 Rodregas opened it to find only a few silvers.

Jaime recently earned a Master of Arts degree from Perelandra College, which Pam and I founded about eight years ago, and which I essentially run.
 The college is one of the occupations that keeps me rushing around, the condition that originally clued me I should read Brother Lawrence.
 Pam and I believed God was asking us to found the college to make a place for people in general and Christians in particular who wanted to become writers to discover what they honestly believe, and to write with courage from their unique visions.
 Thinking of Jaime, I can’t begin to lament the virtually endless hurdles we've been called upon to jump in order to earn and maintain the college’s licensing, accreditation and the rest.
 Jaime's thesis is superb.
 A novella about a young woman whose Christian parents, when their daughter finds herself in extreme trouble, appear more concerned with remaining in accord with their church than with helping or even trying to understand their daughter.
 Its honesty touches my heart.
 Jaime and I spend a day roaming the city, with an hour stop at the Seattle Mystery Bookstore, which played a role in the final scene of Road Kill, an account of a book tour my friend Alan and I did together.
 At several of the tour stops, including Seattle and Portland, Mike Connelly joined us.
 Since then, Mike has become an international bestseller.

“What’s going on?” he demanded, eyes flickering from each of us as he took in all of our strange appearances.
 “Don’t know Jason, we’re as stumped as you.” I said.
 He bit his lip and then smirked.
 “Oh, I almost forgot.
 Look at this.” He gestured at his belt, grinning mischievously.
 Hanging there were a multitude of thin, dangerous looking knives.
 He pulled up his sleeve so I could see another one strapped there.
 “Cool, huh?” Emily had turned to see Jason appear.
 She spotted his knives and groaned, stomping her foot.
 “Aw come on!” Jason whispered behind his hand to Seth and I.

Ah shit…
 Liz – …so that’s why Eugene was in the hospital for that entire week.
 He always claimed that he fell down the stairs to his basement, oh God, I teased him about it, I feel so bad.
 Jim – I wasn’t sposed to say anything, he’s gonna be pissed.
 Liz – what happened?
 Jim - Technically he did fall down the stairs.
 But his dad was the one who kicked him and made him fall.
 He pretty much moved in here ever since that happened, I don’t think he’s been home since for more than five minutes at a time.
 And never when his dad is home.
 Liz – Why don’t the police do anything about it?

“Why do we fight?” she asked again, desperately trying to block every swing.
 Blood covered her arms, and another swing cut through her dress, slicing into the beautiful flesh of her leg.
 “Why, Harruq?
 Why!”
 “I don’t know!” he cried.
 Strength surged into him, dark and unholy.
 In the blink of an eye, he twirled both swords, knocked Aurelia’s staff from her hand, and then looped his right arm all the way around to bury Condemnation deep into her stomach.
 Everything, all fighting, all arguing, all bleeding, living and dying halted at that moment.
 For Harruq, there was only the sight of Aurelia doubled over, her eyes filled with sadness.
 His arm yanked the blade out of her, without any thought on his part.

'Truck' turned out to be an understatement.
 I'd marveled more than once since getting to Utah, at just how big some of the pickup trucks I saw driving around were.
 It seemed like nobody was willing to drive anything around the way it came off of the showroom floor.
 Everything had bigger wheels, and suspension that lifted it up several inches.
 Vincent's truck had more in common with the beasts in monster truck rallies than it did with the souped-up vehicles I'd seen driving around town.
 The tires were the biggest I'd seen on anything outside of a tractor, and the lift kit on it was so outrageously tall that I was pretty sure someone was going to have to lift me into the cab.
 By myself it was going to take a rope and climbing shoes.
 Of course it was black.
 I couldn't imagine Vincent in anything other than a black vehicle.
 Predictably, Vincent was rubbing down his vehicle, but the exercise seemed more targeted to giving him a chance to walk around with his shirt off than it did with cleaning up the already immaculate truck.

Both the knights and the squires always started off the day with a prayer to the Celestial Gods.
 I have not done this in over forty years, but I am going to start again and I would like you to join me if you would.” The two looked at Rodregas, they were very different people, but they both seemed unsure what to say to his request.
 Finally, Doi’van nodded at Imeralda and said to Rodregas, “It has been too long since I have prayed as well, it would be good for the soul.
 Please lead us in prayer.” Imeralda did not say anything, but she nodded and followed the two of them outside.
 Rodregas knelt in the grass facing the sun, the sign of the All-Father in the celestial heavens.
 He reached out and wove his fingers together; he pulled his thumbs down and opened his woven hands in the ancient symbol of opening oneself to the gods.
 “Dear Celestials in the heavens, we open our hearts to you and we accept our duties as your warriors here in the world.
 Let your courage fill our hearts and your strength fill our arms.
 May we know the guidance of your twin children, Honor and Justice.” He then knelt down and pulled one of the two short swords from his weapon harness; he crossed his arms and laid the blade across his own upper arms.
 It was possible, only with great concentration to do this without dropping the sword or cutting himself.

I somehow found my first class before the bell rang.
 Mrs. Sorenson, my biology teacher, was a skinny old woman with curly white hair that looked like Greek paintings of Medusa.
 She made me introduce myself to the class and then let me slink over to my assigned seat.
 I left the class even more depressed than I'd been when I woke up.
 I'd kind of known I'd have an incredible amount of material to catch up on from the first part of the semester.
 I hadn't anticipated that every other student was going to spend the class carefully ignoring me.
 I'd never really fit in, but this was unbelievable.
 New students could always count on someone to offer to be their friends.
 I'd seen it a dozen times before as people had moved in.
 The really attractive people got drawn into the popular circles, less cool people were offered a place with the punks, the nerds, or at least with the drug users, who didn't care as much what you looked or acted like as long as you were hooked on something illegal.

“Any man who would hang out with a brute like Harruq must be a disturbed individual.”
 Both turned to see Aurelia step out from behind a tree.
 She smiled at Harruq, and then nodded to his brother.
 “Care to introduce me?”
 “Oh yeah, this is—”
 “Qurrah Tun, my lady,” Qurrah said with a bow that sent Harruq’s jaw dropping.
 “It is a pleasure to meet you.
 May I have the name of the one who has brought civility to my brother?”
 Aurelia laughed at Harruq’s flabbergasted look.
 “I am Aurelia Thyne,” she said, offering a quick curtsy.

Brandon gently captured my arm as we slipped inside the school.
 "Speaking of stars, I happened to read them last night and they told me a secret."
 "Oh, really?
 Do tell, I always love to hear a good secret."
 There was a new twinkle in his eye as he shook his head.
 "Oh, it wasn't a secret from you, just one you hadn't shared with me.
 Happy birthday.
 I've got a multi-part present in the works, but it's taking a bit longer to wrap it all up, so you may have to wait a little."
 As quickly as that, he winked and turned to catch up with Cassie, leaving me in a state of near shock.
 He'd been inside the house, but hadn't been able to see the kitchen, so he hadn't seen the cupcake and candle.

I couldn’t even imagine what lay in the mountains where I was heading, but there was no going back.
 I wasn’t tired anymore, not as I had been every day since I’d been using magic.
 But I forced those thoughts away, counting steps as I ran.
 I was miles from home.
 A home I might never return to.
 I pushed myself forward through the day, only stopping when I found a patch of sweet berries and a small, babbling creek.
 The berries were wild, small and much less palatable without the guiding hand of an elf, but the water I’d gathered from the stream was cool and refreshing.
 As evening approached, so grew the underlying discomfort with the idea of the coming darkness.
 Not that I hadn’t spent my share of time alone at home, just not alone in the middle of a strange forest outside.
 I might have run through the night and slept at day, but it made little sense to struggle out of fear.

 Marie whirled around to see Davis in the doorway.
 "Would you?"
 she breathed, thrilled at the prospect of spending the day in her beau's company.
 He usually worked on Saturday mornings.
 "If you like."

It is just that, well I was hoping for some more time.” “If you can accept her for who she is, then your time is not over,” said Doi’van, his voice rumbling less than usual.
 “None of us is simple,” continued the Hellborn.
 “The two of us have become friends, even though I am a Hellborn.
 In me flows the blood of the Daemons of the Infernal.” He paused and then his voice cracked, showing a trace of a deep emotion for the first time “Yet, you treat me like a man.
 You must do the same for Imeralda, for you two to be lovers you must learn to share her with others.
 She has a lot of love to give.
 Do not be so selfish as to want it all to yourself.” With that he gave a punch to Rodregas’ side, causing Rodregas to grunt in pain, and Doi’van followed the other two out the door.
 Rodregas laid in the bed, his mind whirling with thoughts.
 At first he thought about the implications of what Jordaan had shared.
 But, then his mind went back again and again over his and Imeralda’s time during the last few weeks and then back to Doi’van’s words.

He frowned and pulled a piece or two out of his head.
 His eyes widened, and I laughed at the shock on his face.
 If we were dead, which was my best guess, why not poke fun at him?
 Seth smiled at me.
 “Well, yes but you have green hair.
 It’s bright green, like neon green.” I shoved my hair in front of my face.
 It was bright green all right.
 I stood up and examined myself.
 I was wearing light brown hunting boots and tight black pants made out of some sort of light cloth.
 A thick woven jacket was shielding me from the October cold.

 I know you’re not implying there’s something insidious about that, that they sold because I was dumbing down or whatever.

 That’s the bottom line.

But I was.
 I was going to do it.
 And if I got caught?
 I could claim ignorance.
 The entire clan thought I was an imbecile in any case.
 Maybe I would just see how close I could get.
 Maybe just to try… And then I was there, standing in front of the Council building and walking in.
 My attempt at stealth was a poor endeavor, but no one ever seemed to pay much attention to me anyway.
 I casually leaned around a doorway to see into the next room, where a small group of villagers stood, blocking my way.
 They spoke in low voices, and as I tried to figure a way past, something seized my attention.

But that does not mean there has been no peace dividend.
 A comparison of the performance of the world economy over the past two decades reveals that after an initial recessionary period of economic dislocation, economic performance has improved on the whole in all regions and almost all countries.
 According to IMF, the growth rate in emerging and developing countries rose from 3.7 per cent annually during the period 1985-94 to 5.1 per cent over the following 10 years and is projected to reach 5.9 per cent in 2005.
 In Sub-Saharan Africa, the rise was from 1.9 per cent to 3.9 per cent and it is expected to reach 5.8 per cent in 2005.
 In the former Soviet republics, growth has accelerated from 0.1 per cent to 4.1 per cent and projected to touch 6.6 per cent next year.
 These trends are likely to continue throughout the decade.
 While foreign aid to developing countries as a percentage of GDP has fallen by 50 per cent since 1990, it has been offset to some extent by a 150 per cent rise in foreign investment.
 In the least developed countries, foreign aid has declined by 24 per cent but this has been offset by a 29-fold increase in foreign investment, so that the combination of foreign aid and foreign investment as a percentage of GDP has remained constant.
 If the rich countries, particularly USA, had met the UN development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of GDP, progress in improving the human condition in countries characterized by a high incidence of poverty would have been faster.
 These real and significant gains have been offset and to a large extent obscured in our minds by the persistence and aggravation of problems that constitute the other side of the post-Cold War ledger.

“And what do you do when facing a warrior in full plate armor?” asked Doi’van.
 “Even chain mail can stop an arrow or the edge of a sword.
 And while a mace is great against chain, crushing your opponent and breaking their bones, such tactics take far too long against plate armor.” Rodregas was not sure what to say to that question.
 The mace or the war hammer was, of course, the weapon of choice against all well armored opponents.
 Doi’van was right, edged weapons were not of much use against a full set of plate armor.
 That is why knights or others who could afford the cost wore all that metal.
 Rodregas had to shrug; he had no answer other than an extended fight with the mace that often did not end until one or the other was too tired and battered to defend themselves.
 Doi’van nodded at Rodregas expression of confusion, “My clan is known as the greatest warriors there are against heavily armored opponents because we are masters of the halberd.
 With a halberd we can quickly dismount an armored warrior, knock him to the ground and then, with the leverage provided by the halberd…” He swung his staff and acted like he was holding down a foe with his left foot.
 He made a savage two-handed thrust downward, “...we can pierce his armor and win the battle quickly.” Rodregas nodded.

Where have you been?"
 Marie caught her breath.
 In her misery over leaving Rick, she hadn't gotten around to thinking up a plausible story.
 "I-I'd rather not talk about it."
 "Not talk about it?"
 Mrs. Tranton shot her husband a warning glance.
 Marie had surely been through a very traumatic experience, and they shouldn't make her talk about it until she was ready.
 "Why don't I have Louise make us some breakfast, and we can talk," Mrs. Tranton suggested.
 "If you can take your hands off our daughter long enough."
 Mrs. Tranton smiled.

“Sure thing,” Harruq agreed.
 “Come on.
 I have an idea.”
 He grabbed Qurrah’s arm and hooked his elbow around it.
 Qurrah was too weak to complain, so together they ran down the streets.
 They passed closed homes containing people praying for safety and victory.
 Looming ahead of them was the southern gate.
 Hundreds of soldiers stacked against it, their shields braced and ready.
 All along the walls, archers released arrow after arrow into the darkness.
 “How are we to get closer?” Qurrah asked.

 He seems to have learned that from Eugene.

 Liz – That I’m not sure of, but it doesn’t seem to be any sort of skill at video games.

The two brothers bowed and then left to do as their master commanded.

 [section break](break.png)
 Dieredon watched the brothers travel back to Woodhaven.
 He had been waiting outside the town, and in the starlight the swathe of darkness rolling across the land had caught his eye.
 He had followed and from a distance observed the short meeting.
 His eyes flipped between the half-orcs and their master.
 His heart was torn.
 He had already warned Harruq that he would tolerate no strange behavior, yet he had given a similar warning to the man with the ever-changing face.
 “I do this for you, Aurelia,” he said, his decision made.

In the bars, we saw girls get used by both men and farm animals.
 A few times we rode in taxis to motels where prostitutes greeted us.
 We would barter, object to the price, and leave while the coarser of them screeched obscenities.
 Some cabbies, after three or four such stops, stoically delivered us back downtown.
 Others pulled up beside a gang of thugs.
 Then we ran for our lives.
 The night Eric joined us, so did big Mike Beatty.
 He was about 6’6”, 280 pounds.
 We rode with a cabby to three motels.
 After the first, Eric said, “This is bad, Ken.

The branches were way beyond reach.
 Of course, she was a Forest Nymph and he had seen her move in trees like a squirrel.
 Still she seemed very vulnerable high up there; he had to get to her.
 Rodregas took off his harness and boots and grabbed the ridges of the bark.
 He had climbed walls where you stuck your toes in the crack left by old mortar worn away.
 The bark of the tree, like the rest of the tree, was on an epic scale and actually provided good leverage for climbing.
 He did not look at how high he had to go, but instead simply started to climb.
 The climb took far longer than he hoped and he could not see Imeralda as he climbed.
 He was finally getting close to the first of the branches of the tree when he heard Doi’van yell.
 “Rodregas, what in the name of the Celestial Winds are you doing?” He paused in his climb, his toes caught in the bark.

We've come for one purpose and one only.
 No more murdered hikers, no more convenient accidents.
 This ends tonight."
 Brandon worked more mockery into a simple clap than most of us could carry off with a full cast of supporting actors.
 "Always observing the old forms, aren't you, Alec.
 Well now it's time for a whole new batch."
 One second Brandon was a human, the next he was a huge monstrosity, a thing that normally dwelt in the bottom, most primitive parts of the mind, venturing out only to star prominently in nightmares.
 The rush of power beat back at our entire pack.
 If it'd been a physical wind it would've knocked me over.
 Intangible or not, it still staggered me and only my grip on Jasmin and Dom kept me from dropping to my knees.

 My mother’s diary.
 Her writings went on until they became more erratic, answering questions I didn’t want answered.

 It’s just as Junnie feared—just what he’d done to my mother.
 I will find a way to stop him.

As we prepared to leave we were treated with the same long embrace as when we arrived.
 As we drove off down the narrow road, Brandon waved.
 Could we really be getting our son back?
 We knew at least for now, he was exactly where he should be.
 He was far from the streets he once roamed and free from the drugs he once craved.
 Chapter 23: The Where, When & Why of Drugs We talked to Brandon as often as he could and we kept in touch with the counselors weekly.
 Over the next two months we received calls from our son and his counselor as he was in the part of the program where he was assigned to come clean with his family, acknowledge his behavior, and confess to the many terrible things he had done.
 The calls were very hard on us because even though they were necessary, we felt like he was getting so much better and we were getting all this bad news about stuff in the past.
 We understood that this was a necessary part of his treatment; he needed to cleanse himself and ask for our forgiveness.
 At the end of every confession he would ask if we would accept him back into the family to which we always answered yes!

Some of her enthusiasm wilted in the face of my incomprehension.
 "I just thought maybe you'd want to go.
 You know.
 You said you loved the music, that it was what made you want to read the book.
 It's playing for more than a month, so there's plenty of time to make arrangements.
 I can set everything up if you want."
 It seemed impossible that she'd be so insensitive to my situation.
 I opened my mouth to tell her off, and then realized she wasn't privy to everything happening in my head.
 My world felt like it was disintegrating around me, and hers continued on as normal.
 It should have been depressing, but somehow I found it so ludicrous I giggled.

As he glanced up, he slid whatever he’d been working on into a pocket at his hip.
 It dawned on me then that the main room had only the entrance and two other doors.
 If we were staying with Ruby then the second room must be hers.
 I meant to offer Chevelle my room to sleep in, but the look on his face was so unnerving I could not stop myself from offering something else.
 “You don’t… you don’t have to protect me.” I hoped it was true.
 “I can turn myself in, take myself to the village, or…” I was trying to say Grand Council, but the words stuck in my throat.
 No part of me wanted to surrender to my mother’s killers, but I could not make Chevelle suffer more than he already had.
 My hands trembled and I tightened them into fists.
 He was my watcher; he must have felt he needed to fulfill his duties, to keep his honor.
 He would finish our journey and return me to the village.

As scary as all of this was, I knew flying away and never knowing what'd happened would be worse.
 Alec was probably going to die, and all of the rest of us with him, but if he didn't, if the pack somehow managed to survive the coming crisis, I wanted to be there.
 Alec was more than capable of sending me away and then never letting me know he'd survived.
 There was a constant war inside him over what to do with me and I couldn't afford to give up my one advantage.
 He seemed less able to contemplate cutting me out of his life when I was around.
 I planned on playing that card for all it was worth.
 I was staying and that was it.
 Alec sighed, presumably in resignation, and then suddenly my legs were thrown up in front of me as he picked me up with inhuman speed.
 Only the steady pressure of Alec's arm around my waist kept me from screaming, and then I was back on my feet, and being carefully, but firmly shoved through a tangled knot of bodies.
 My shoes had never been intended to allow ankles to withstand that kind of punishment.

Liz – I’ve got pictures of that as well.
 It all makes for a wonderful family album to show my children one day.
 ‘Look kids, here’s your grandmother and another one of her “friends”.’  ‘Mommy, grandma sure had a lot of friends,’ ‘yes sweetie she did, but so did your grandfather.’
 Cleo – And when do you ever plan to have children hmmm?
 You waste all your time dreaming about your thick-headed friend Jim when you could be serious with a real man who treats you more like the beautiful young woman you are.
 Liz – I like Jim, he’s nice, and fun to be with.
 And I think he’ll figure out that I like him more than just being friends.
 Cleo – My daughter you don’t seem to understand men in the least.

My son Cody and I went to Tae Kwon Do classes twice a week.
 And I was managing Cody’s Little League team, hoping he might become a pitcher instead of a ninja.
 Probably because I didn’t sleep enough, my emotions had shut down, and every day I sensed impending doom.
 Something had to change.
 My kids didn’t deserve a catatonic dad.
 One late afternoon as I sat on the grass at the University of San Diego, overlooking the harbor and wondering how I could fix my emotions, I mumbled, “Okay, where should I start?” Then I remembered advice Master Jeong, our Tae Kwon Do instructor, often gave.
 He told us, "Everything begins with the spirit.
 From the spirit come the thoughts.
 From the thoughts come the actions.
 From the actions come the habits.

He is often compared to courtly though dipsomaniacal photographer Bill Eggleston, a friend of Buddy’s from those acme days.
 The cover photograph of Black Lung’s Pepper Records album, Turntable Poison, is an unaccredited Eggleston photograph.
 (It is, of course, a weathered Sinclair sign, imbued with the enchantment Mr. Eggleston brought to all his work, a divergence quite inexplicable.)
 Buddy was loved, revered.
 He was not held to the same rules as everyone else.
 So it goes with the great.
 And when Buddy started using drugs, mixing bennies, reds and laxatives in dangerous quantities, no one was there to question him.
 Of course, drugs were part of the scene then.
 They were everywhere.
 In the back of every minibus, in the bathroom of every nightclub, at practice sessions, in the homes of every groupie.

She said she's already arranged for a charter plane out of St. George.
 If I leave in the next ten minutes, we can make the flight out of Salt Lake International with something like half an hour to spare."
 We both sat there in silence for a few seconds as everything sank in, and then Mom exploded into motion.
 She ran downstairs to repack her photography equipment, all the while yelling upstairs to verify that I'd packed all of the other essentials she was going to need.
 Almost before I'd even finished assimilating how quickly Alec had pulled everything together, Mom was backing down the lane as I waved goodbye.
 Alec appeared within thirty seconds of Mom's departure, Isaac close behind him.
 "We need to go.
 One of Brandon's people just got close enough to smell us.
 They left before we could tell for sure who it was, but the odds of them coming back with lots of help just went through the roof.
 If we're still around when they do, things will get ugly."

East of the Rigon River was Neldar, ruled by Karak.
 To the west was Mordan, governed by Ashhur.
 However, there was a delta at the end of the river controlled by none.
 Within were a few small villages with no government, no ruler.
 Karak brought his troops to establish order.
 Ashhur was quick to defend it, and in turn, claim it as his own.”
 “You speak of centuries ago,” Qurrah interrupted.
 “Yet you claim to be one of Karak’s first.”
 “I was his high priest, half-orc,” Velixar said, his eyes narrowing.
 “He blessed me so I would never die of sickness, age, or blade.

I breathed a sigh of relief that he wasn't going to continue fishing for compliments, and returned to my drawing.
 I knew I should open my books back up and study, but it was starting to take shape, and I figured it was only a few minutes away from becoming recognizable.
 Once that happened my meager drawing skills would evaporate and I'd have to stop anyways.
 For whatever reason every time I tried to work on something after I realized what it was, I completely ruined it.
 One of many reasons why I'd never really pursued drawing.
 A short time later I surfaced again and looked down to find a familiar landscape.
 The body of water had morphed into an oblong pond with a crescent island positioned almost exactly in the center.
 I still remembered the first time I'd been told a monster had taken a bite out of the island, and that was the reason it was so oddly shaped.
 The trees were all familiar too.
 I'd climbed each and every one of them at least once.

I felt my lips trembling, and he freed one of his hands to brush it lightly across my mouth.
 "You've been a godsend for her, Adri.
 As badly as it hurts each time she sneaks away, it hasn't happened nearly as often since you got here.
 She's been improving ever since you moved into town, and the rate of change has increased over the last two weeks."
 "I suppose we make quite the pair, her and I.
 Two shattered little dolls trying our best to make sure the pieces don't blow away and leave us with nothing.
 An imposition to everyone around us."
 He hugged me to him as he shook his head.
 "Not an imposition.
 Never that."

Please, Harruq.
 I don’t want to fight you.”
 “I didn’t want you to fight either,” Harruq said, his eyes leaving hers for an instant.
 He took a step toward her and raised his swords, just as when they sparred.
 “Stop this,” Aurelia said.
 Her staff remained at her side.
 “Will you kill me, too?”
 “I asked you not to fight, but here you are.
 Qurrah made it simple, Aurry.
 Either I love you or I kill you.”

“You’re traveling with us?” “You don’t mind, do you?” “No, of course not,” I gushed.
 It was too eager, so I explained, “Chevelle’s been training me.” “Well, we can certainly help with that.” I grimaced at the thought of Ruby’s training methods.
 “Don’t fret.
 She’s actually very talented.” His smile warmed.
 “An asset, you’ll see.” An asset?
 Ruby came through the door, in a movement that could nearly have been classified as whirling.
 “Come on, Steed.
 We need to set you up outside of town.
 Chevelle is afraid we’re causing a scene in the village.” She laughed lightly.
 It seemed like she was having fun.

"All right."
 She closed her eyes and began thinking about Davis and how it felt to dance with him.
 She thought about her mother and father and brother and how they'd laughed and talked at meals before her brother had been disowned.
 She thought about Tom and the speakeasy.
 She opened her eyes to see Rick watching her anxiously.
 She swallowed.
 "I'm still here."
 "I'm sorry."
 "Maybe I should go walk in the garden.
 That's how I got here, so that's probably the best way to get back."

 CM:  	You describe Dickinson as the Wise Old Man, what do you mean by that?
 BG:  	You know, Creole, you know the man.
 Wise One, in, I think it’s Navajo—no Apache culture, maybe it’s Navajo, too--he was the younger brother of Killer-of-enemies, part of a holy pair.
 That’s Sid and Jim.
 (laughs)
 CM:  	And you ever hear from Tony Hudson?
 BG: 	 Naw, fuck man, that’s Pete’s gig.

(leaps from the chair and runs offstage while bawling)
 Character 1- (Shrugs his shoulders) After I found out that dad was really a convict, I found myself wanting to know more about him, so I started spending time near the local jails….
 (hears character 2 approaching and leaps behind the couch)
 Character 2- (enters the stage) Ok, where are you?
 Are you quite proud of yourself?
 You made yet another Doctor run screaming into the night.
 And you didn’t even get any drugs this time.
 Oh the things I have to go through to keep you sane.
 Where are you?

His precious undead were being massacred.
 He could feel their numbers dwindling in his mind, now but a third of what his glorious army had been.
 “This has gone on long enough,” he seethed.
 He outstretched his hands and shrieked words of magic.
 Qurrah staggered back, in awe of the power that came rolling forth.
 The fog of darkness swirled and recoiled at each word Velixar spoke.
 The cold on his flesh grew sharper as the blackness grew thicker.
 “Be gone from me!” Velixar cried, yanking down his arms.
 Six fingered hands ripped up from the black, some smaller than a child’s, some as large as houses.
 Each one lunged to the sky, clutching and grabbing at the elves that circled above.

 We could hear him approaching the bedroom as the volume of his voice increased.
 We watched through the slats in the closet door as he would open her dresser drawers and rummage through her belongings, including her undergarments, while looking around over his shoulder, still yelling her name.
 Eventually, he would leave and somehow mom would come up with the rent to keep a roof over our heads for another month.
 We were getting old enough to know that we were different than most families in many ways, but we always knew we had a loving mother.

They're sensationalistic.

 "Get me some?"
 "Yeah--we'll rent some."
 "Rent?"
 "Yeah--there are stores where you can pay a couple of dollars and take the movie home for the night."
 "Really?"
 He smiled, taking her hand and squeezing it.
 "I'll find something good--`Gone With the Wind,' `Casablanca.'

I am told to pull it up, but warned that it might easily disconnect and if it did, the bust would be aborted.
 After some light tugging on the mic to get it between my collar and my neck, Officer White says the sound is good.
 As we talk on the phone, he assures me that I am doing fine and I should continue to hold my position no matter how hard Ashley and Steve try to get me to go to their location.
 The attempt to move me is a tactic the narcotics’ officers know well.
 The goal of the drug dealer will be to get me on his ground and on his terms.
 With so many officers surrounding me in a variety of cars, trucks, vans and on foot around the parking lot acting like patrons of the nearby stores, there is no way they could all uproot and follow me to some new location.
 Not to mention that marked police cars are waiting within striking distance of the retail center.
 I know the cops can hear everything I say so I spare them my nervous singing and limit my comments, fighting my compulsion to curse wickedly at them.
 I’m staring off across the wetlands, connecting with known drug dealers, talking to undercover narcotics officers on my personal cell phone, feeling a wire taped to my body and extending up to my neck, holding a bottle filled with one hundred Oxys in my jacket pocket.
 What brought me here?

Antonil halted at the center of Veldaren where the four main roads of the city interconnected and a large marble fountain towered over all.
 Not bothering to call for silence or attention, he unrolled the scroll and shouted its edict.
 Because of his rank, the troops in attendance, and the overall respect given to the man who had engineered the city’s successful defense only days before, he was quickly given a respectful silence.
 “By order of the King, all elves are to be removed from Neldar lands.
 They shall not travel within our cities, live in our settlements, or trade with our people.
 They are banned in all possible sense of the word.
 They have abandoned us, so let us abandon them.
 These are the words of your King, Edwin Vaelor, and may they never be forgotten.”
 Antonil closed the scroll and then nodded for his soldiers to return to their post.
 Holding in a curse, he headed to the royal stables.

“Ugh, cat pee.” I thought I might hurl.
 How much of that healing crap had I drunk?
 I heaved once and Steed shook beneath me with laughter.
 I glanced up to find him looking at Chevelle.
 For some reason it angered me, even though I knew Steed wasn’t laughing at him.
 I was talking again, without regard to thought.
 “His mother died, too.
 We killed her.” It sounded so matter-of-fact, my head bobbing along with the words.
 I couldn’t seem to stop.
 My mouth opened to speak once more but I was suddenly swept up, off Steed’s lap and into Chevelle’s arms.

Seth stared stone faced at Kojas as he slowly walked towards us.
 With every step, Seth’s hand inched closer to his sword.
 Emily cracked her knuckles quietly and held them stiff at her sides.
 Her face was determined, but I saw her eyes flicker.
 Jason flicked out his knives and held them so tightly that his knuckles were white.
 If he gripped any harder, I was afraid he would snap his fingers off.
 And, me?
 I pulled an arrow out faster than you could say oh-my-god-there’s-a-hideous-monster-coming-to-whip-our-butts.
 And then I launched it.
 The arrow shot at Kojas, speeding through the air.

"That's all right, my dear.
 Mr. Lawson and I were just concluding our business."
 He stood, addressing the young man who'd risen when Marie entered.
 "I don't believe you've met my daughter.
 Marie, this is Daniel Lawson.
 He's just bought that piece of land I'd intended to use for a warehouse a few years ago."
 Daniel smiled at Marie, shaking the hand she'd extended.
 "It's nice to meet you, Miss Tranton."
 "Likewise, Mr.
 Lawson."

Jim – Hate to break it to you, but Eugene doesn’t inspire fear into anyone.
 Well maybe girls who might one day marry a guy with the name Eugene.
 In fact I bet mom’s all over the country use that as a threat ‘eat yer peas or else maybe you’ll end up marrying a guy named Eugene.’  I bet it works too.
 I’d be afraid.
 Eugene - Shut up dude.
 Jim – So, what’d you do to get your butt almost handed to you this time?
 Eugene – Nothing.
 Jim – Even wannabes don’t usually beat people up for no reason.
 What’d you do this time?
 Didja make a pass at one of their sisters?

“They did not the first time.
 Why do you hope so now?”
 “Because these arrows are different.”
 He fired three at once, all burying deep into Velixar’s chest.
 The man in black screamed as the sacred water burned his skin.
 He fell to one knee and vomited a pile of white flesh and maggots.
 “You will suffer,” he gasped.
 “For ages, I will make you suffer.”
 “Try it,” said Dieredon.
 Two more arrows flew, but they halted in mid-air.

 Johnny – You’re a lot of help.
 Jim – What can I say?
 I’m a fountain of wisdom.
 Johnny – Don’t you want to adopt Gene?
 Jim – Yes, I’d like to have Gene as a member of the family, which is a weird thing to say.

Marie watched in fascination as he applied the lotion to his arms and chest.
 When he was finished, she told him, "I'll do your back."
 "Thanks."
 She used both hands, slowly rubbing the lotion over every inch of his back.
 She couldn't even imagine touching Davis like this, and she didn't think it had anything to do with morals.
 She just didn't feel comfortable enough with him to do something this personal.
 Yet here she was running her hands all over the back of a man she'd known only a week.
 Was it a difference in morals?
 Or times?
 Or was it Rick?

The attack had been more sudden than usual and nobody had been close enough to catch me.
 In those circumstances experience had shown that I led with my head.
 "It was just the heat here.
 I'm not used to it.
 Now please put me down."
 Alec looked at me doubtfully, then took a deep, no doubt calming breath, and shrugged.
 The movement seemed too casual, almost as if he was angry, but trying to hide it.
 I wanted to try and make eye contact to test my hypothesis, but was afraid of what I'd see.
 The tingling was spreading, no doubt a bad sign.
 Maybe I'd hit my head even harder than I thought.

 Davis is leaving."
 John had come in search of them.
 "Are you all right?"
 "We're just having a mother/daughter talk," Mrs. Tranton said as Marie reached for a napkin.
 "Tell Davis she'll be out in a minute."
 Marie wiped her face.
 "Well, I guess I have to go face him."
 "Are you sure you want to end your betrothal, darling?"

The look of concern for my intelligence was not exactly uncommon, but it was something I could never quite get used to.
 “Not that I know of,” she said.
 She got her mischievous grin then.
 “Though I did read once that there was a way to steal life force and use it for yourself.” Chevelle shot her a stern rebuke from the front of the pack.
 She continued as if excusing herself, “But it was merely a fairy’s tale and probably not entirely accurate.” Then, in a lower voice, “It is fun to speculate, though.” I wiped at my cheek to clear the dampness from the mist, mirroring her low tone as I questioned her.
 “How would you steal life force?” “Well, like I said, probably not accurate… but you would have to take the other’s life in order to gain their power.
 Take it in a specific manner.” She noticed Chevelle glaring at her and clamped her mouth shut.
 I waited until he turned back around before I whispered, “Ruby, did you bring the magic book with you?” She smiled.
 “Can I read it?” She winked at me.
 I started to share her grin, but before I could, Chevelle was in front of us, his horse blocking my way.

 On this I’m quite serious my boy, I’ve seen the way she looks at you.
 Jim – And where did you gain the experience to gauge a woman’s affections from a look?
 Art – Your mother used to look at me the same way.
 Jim – Oh wonderful, mother looked at you the same way.

“My brother can be a mindless butcher, but he must be angered or spurned into battle.
 When peaceful, his mind entertains ideas that run…‌ contrary to what he and I are.”
 “And what is that, Qurrah?
 What are you and your brother?”
 The fire sparked a shower of orange into the sky as Qurrah spoke.
 “Superior.”
 In the distance, elven eyes watched that cough of flame stretch to the stars, as well as the sight of those two huddled figures talking long through the night.

I spotted her red arm just before my body felt like fire.
 I closed my eyes and blacked out.
 I didn’t really black out but that’s what I thought at the time.
 I opened my eyes to find I was sitting on the ground next to my sleeping body.
 I saw Emily sitting there, saying nothing for once.
 Something fell off my back and I picked it up.
 It was a wooden bow, and when I reached behind my back I felt a quiver full of feathered arrows strapped there.
 I ran a finger over the smooth, dark wood and turned to see Seth crashing out of the woods.
 I smirked at him and pointed at his head.
 “You have dark blue hair.” I giggled, not knowing why I was giggling after what had just happened to us a few minutes ago.

When I arrived at home I called Officer White’s phone and told him I had a drug deal set up with Steve and Ashley and they wanted one hundred Oxy pills.
 To say he was shocked would be an understatement.
 He wanted to know how I did this and was I sure it was Steve, as well as numerous other questions.
 I told him that he had told me he didn’t want to know anything, and I preferred to keep it that way for now.
 I did give Officer White enough information so he was sure I had the right people.
 I just needed to know when and where the narcotics squad wanted to do this deal and what I needed to do next.
 The Officer was excited at the opportunity to get this guy and he arranged me coming to the police station so I could make the call to set up the one hundred Oxy pill deal on a recorded phone line.
 The drug deal itself would happen later and I would need to be evasive and the where and the when as to the actual exchange of money for drugs.
 I was told to call her from my phone and tell her I would call her tomorrow around noon.
 Chapter 18: Game Time I arrived at the station and was escorted to an interrogation room.

Pot smoke always filled the air.
 The family room had an array of donated couches and chairs and beanbags gathered by the roommates and friends.
 A long curled phone cord hung from the center of the ceiling with a roach clip taped to it.
 This was a convenient way to pass a joint around the room without ever leaving your chair.
 The clip swung from smoker to smoker.
 I got up and went to school early the next day, and then my daily routine would repeat itself.
 Somehow I willed myself to stick it out at school despite my surroundings and the influences of my peers.
 I don’t know what it was that enabled me to do this, to not fall entirely into the wasteland of addiction and entitlement.
 Biology?
 Character?

Your mom’s had it even rougher than you have, and you’re not going to leave her anytime soon.
 Not for long anyway.” He knew me better than I did.
 I had told him some part of me blamed myself for my dad’s first heart attack, the one that weakened him and probably set him up for the big one.
 On a sweltering summer day, I had teased him about being old when he declined to volunteer to keep score at a golf tournament I played in, though I knew all about his angina.
 He must've wanted me to believe in his strength.
 So he changed his mind and walked the course, and landed in the hospital.
 One evening Eric gave me a sweater and a stack of records.
 Thelonius Monk.
 Dave Brubeck with Gerry Mulligan.
 Lena Horne.

Harruq pointed past the army to where a long line of men stood in the distance, carrying no light or torch.
 “What are they doing?” he asked.
 Qurrah searched the line, and he saw what he suspected.
 “The necromancer,” he observed, pointing to the black shape hidden underneath robes and a hood.
 “Those alongside him are dead, Harruq.
 They serve only him.”
 “Huh,” Harruq said.
 “Lot of good he’s doing.
 How are the orcs going to get through the wall, they have nothing but…”
 The man in black robes lifted his hand.

“Too bad they can’t stay inside with us.
 Frey can have my room, I’ll be out all night, and you can take the spare.” She took one last look at me before she rushed out, apparently satisfied with her project.
 And I was alone with Chevelle again.
 My pulse quickened and I had to remind myself he hated me.
 He was my watcher.
 He was fulfilling a duty.
 Then I realized what Ruby had said and I wondered if my brain would ever be quick enough to keep up.
 “Guests?” He hesitated before answering.
 “We will be traveling with some friends.” He was so vague.
 A formless irritation started to crawl its way to the surface, but I had to remember I had no right to ask.

I had no desire to become separated again.
 “When can’t you use sarcasm?” I asked loudly.
 He didn’t reply to me because he had spotted Emily.
 She was slowly backing up with her palms out.
 Fire danced from her fingertips and twisted towards the troll and frost beast.
 The beast breathed and ice sprayed from its mouth.
 Emily moved her hand over and the ice evaporated into mist.
 She was holding up fine but I didn’t know how much longer.
 I strung my bow and released an arrow.
 It pierced the frost beast’s pelt and it fell to the ground.

She was in her own garden.
 She ran to her house, tearing open the door and dashing upstairs.
 She paused at her room long enough to toss her bag onto her bed and then dashed to her parents' room.
 "Mother!
 Father!"
 She banged on the door.
 The door opened, and her father stared at her in shock.
 Her mother, however, jumped out of bed with a cry of joy and threw her arms around Marie.
 "Marie!
 You're all right!

I listened, hoping to gain clarity… but something was still wrong.
 Nothing fit.
 They discussed Junnie and Anvil and Fannie, but those all felt like two sets of people now.
 They were worried; I could hear the stress in their tones.
 How long had I been like this?
 It seemed so long, trapped here.
 I remembered the vines.
 I tried to feel my arms, see if they were still there.
 Was that why I couldn’t move?
 Was I still tied to a wall?

The half-orc stood, his hands clenched into fists.
 He hooked them through the air as he repeated his question.
 “Was it willing or not?” he demanded.
 “Yes,” Ahrqur whispered, grimacing as if filled with horrid pain.
 “When she approached me, I offered no resistance.
 Now will you let me return to peace?”
 “Not yet.
 Harruq, would you like to tell him?”
 Ahrqur glanced at Harruq, who was grinning wide.
 “You can see we have orcish blood in us, right?” Harruq asked.

Tears?
 No, blood.
 My nose was bleeding.
 It took a moment to get my bearings.
 My bed sheets were a tangle and my clothes were disheveled.
 It must have been a dream.
 I had fallen asleep looking at my mother’s pendant, trying to remember her, and somehow combined it with the disaster I had read of the northern clans.
 It was only a dream.
 Shaken, I sat up, struggling to collect myself.
 I reached up to remove the pendant from the hook and squeezed it tight in my fist.

My heart pounded, the wind cutting against the damp sweat on my skin.
 I wanted to understand what had just happened, but I couldn’t process it.
 It was just too painful.
 I was confused, drained to the point of exhaustion.
 I had no way out.
 When they found me, I would have to surrender.
 I could see no other option.
 No one came.
 I wasn’t fool enough to go back voluntarily, but for some reason, they hadn’t followed.
 I didn’t know what to do with myself.

Ever since learning Alec's secret I'd assumed everyone here was a shape shifter.
 Only I hadn't ever felt the underlying hint of power and energy from her that I'd come to associate with Alec and the others.
 "Wait, you're not a shape shifter?
 How is that possible?"
 Rachel's expression as she tried to understand my question was so surprised it actually managed to lighten the mood.
 "Oh, I forget sometimes how much you don't know.
 I'm normal, and Mom's normal, but everyone else is a shape shifter.
 Human-shape shifter marriages almost never happen, but when they do the kids can go either way.
 Alec became a shape shifter, and I'm just a run-of-the-mill girl without even a single superpower."
 We sat in silence for several seconds as I tried to process how that new piece of information fit in with everything else I already knew.

However, his assistant Korin had only been an Immortalist for a few decades; his victims and his power were still purely mortal.
 Rodregas had known that in a fair fight he could kill him.
 Korin was no warrior, and his actions spoke of cowardice when Korin hurt those who had no chance in a fight against him.
 Rodregas had been trying to get him alone, where he could kill him without blame, for years.
 Rodregas went over and reached down to grab the bottom of the heavily made bed, and almost fell over when the bed lifted far more easily than expected.
 The sound of wood screeched as weight switched to the back legs of the bed and then moved at his awkward action, and the top of the columns smashed against the plaster ceiling.
 Rodregas carefully lowered the bed back down; as the bed settled back to the floor he was covered by a light dusting of plaster from the damaged ceiling.
 Was Rodregas really that strong?
 Or was the bed just lighter than it looked?
 He went back over to the trunk and lifted it up; it to went up too easily and felt strangely light.

The doors were large enough that the three of them could have entered abreast through the threshold and the doors were solid enough, looking as if they were made out of whole trees.
 Bound in iron, they looked like they could handle a battering ram better than even the front gates.
 A group of knights stood tall next to the doors, but their heads tracked the presence of Rodregas and his two companions.
 Rodregas vaguely remembered one as Gorin, an older man who under more prosperous times for the knighthood would now be enjoying his retirement.
 “Gorin!” Rodregas yelled boastfully, “Open the doors, the Grand Marshal says that I may review the choice I must make.” Rodregas walked over and slapped the knight in the arm, laying it on heavy.
 Luckily, his success on the field had him in a good mood.
 Rodregas waved at the heavy doors as if wiggling his fingers could open them.
 “Sir Rodregas, you look good for having just completed the tournament this day,” said Gorin.
 “I would not expect you to be moving around much yet.” Rodregas nodded.
 He could not explain that he already had a minor sigil of healing.

“Please, move.
 Give me an excuse to kill you.”
 Harruq was too stunned and disoriented to give him what he wanted.
 Instead he lied there, his nose throbbing and his swords limp in his hands.
 “What do you want?” he asked, ignoring the sharp pain in his throat as a tiny drop of blood trickled down his neck.
 “The entire village of Cornrows is missing,” Dieredon said.
 “Most likely dead.”
 Harruq’s breathing quickened.
 His hands tightened around the hilts of his weapons.
 “I had nothing to do with it,” he said.

"Did I say something wrong?"
 Alec's voice was surprisingly gentle.
 "No, you've nothing to feel sorry about.
 I should tell you though that calling a shape shifter a werewolf is the kind of insult that nearly always results in a fight, and often even a death."
 I felt momentarily like I'd been hit.
 Alec was waiting for me to respond, but I couldn't bring myself to say anything.
 "I'm sorry; I didn't mean to scare you.
 I forget sometimes how much more violent my world is."
 I wasn't any less shocked, but his tone was so apologetic I couldn't help but smile.
 "That's better; I much prefer the happy Adri face to the scared Adri."

Until now he had seemed very thoughtful, almost careful in the words he spoke, but when he spoke of killing and shook his head in defiance his mouth widened.
 To say he grinned would not be accurate; he showed his teeth.
 There was something very dangerous about this Hellborn, something that reminded you that this creature was the spawn of Greater Daemons.
 While he might not have chosen the side of the Infernal hells, there was a very dark and dangerous side to him.
 Rodregas could almost smell the fire and brimstone.
 Rodregas met Doi’van’s smile with a smile of his own.
 He reached out and grabbed Doi’van’s forearm and gripped it in the handshake of warriors and said, “You have spoken to me honestly.
 I will honor that with my own honesty.
 I don’t know exactly how I ended up in this body, but I do know that I killed Ravenhurr, and I killed his bastard assistant, Korin.
 The Immortalists are a sore on the world.

Art – It isn’t that bad, except for the constant being on guard so that you don’t say the wrong thing, but that soon becomes second nature.
 Jim – What happens if it doesn’t?
 Art – Like with most of the natural world, men who don’t adapt to changes don’t live for very much longer.
 Jim – How do you always do that?
 Art – Do what?
 Jim – Put the worse possible face on things, all while managing to scare me to the point that I fear for my life.
 Art- I don’t always do it.
 Only when it would be really funny.
 Jim – How does now make it really funny?
 Art – It’s about time I passed on my extensive knowledge about women.

 Liz – Jim, you have some strange dreams.
 Jim – Tell me about it, the weirdest one yet is when you, me, Johnny and Gene were exploring this haunted mansion, Scooby Doo style.
 Yeah, that was a weird one.
 Liz – What happened?
 Jim – Well there were things that one would expect in a haunted mansion, ghosts and dancing skeletons and strange noises.
 But then on top of that Johnny and Gene actually got along well.
 They actually paired up to explore the mansion willingly, and they didn’t kill each other.
 That’s not the weirdest thing, but you get the point.
 Liz – So you and me were teamed together?

The chorus of droning moans agreed.

 “If there was any time I needed you, Sonowin, it is now,” the elf said as he fled across the grass.
 Each breath made his chest ache.
 His right arm hung limp, and his other hand clutched his shoulder.
 He desperately needed to bandage it but had no time.
 A wave of undead moans reached his sensitive ears.
 Dieredon shuddered.
 “How many does he command?” he asked.

He was a midget who needed a wheelchair, but whose live-in babe was about twice his height and half his age.
 She reminded me of the barmaid in New Orleans.
 I was mourning the loss of that dream when the midget said, “You guys from San Diego, must’ve driven a boat now and then.” Bob said he had driven a couple speedboats.
 “Sure you did,” the midget said.
 “Johnny’ll get you the boat.
 All you gotta do is take it out a coupla miles, pick up some items, bring’em in.
 You’re game, right?” After considering the looks worn by the midget, Johnny, and even the babe, we said, “Right.
 You bet.” Johnny drove us to a row of affordable motels, parked at the curb and pointed to one of them.
 “I’ll come for you tomorrow.
 Say 6:30.

She stiffened slightly as I hugged her, but then smiled and returned the gesture with an earnestness that made me think she hadn't had much in the way of hugs in her life.
 "Well, I hope it doesn't come to that, but thanks again.
 I may still flunk out, but seeing the expression on her face makes it worthwhile."
 Was it possible to be both shy and confident at the same time?
 If it was, Dominic's fluid, expressive face pulled it off.
 "Nonsense.
 Once we undo all of the damage from her teaching you, you'll do so well even she won't flunk you."
 It went against everything past experience with Mrs. Tiggs had taught me, but I almost believed her.
 Chapter 26 It was amazing how quickly my classes flew by when I had a friend, or at least a protector, with me at all times.
 Then again all of Monday had flown by, not just the school portion of the day, so it really shouldn't have been a surprise today was doing likewise.

“What the heck?” I fell on my butt and blinked as Jason picked himself off the ground.
 “Sorry,” I said and stood up.
 “Watch where you’re going… Jazell, look out!” Jason suddenly yelled.
 I dove onto the ground and felt the monster brush past me.
 I looked up to see Jason rolling on the ground before jumping on the faery jerk’s back.
 He yelled at Jason right before I saw the knife disappear somewhere in his neck.
 The faery’s yells turned to screams and then nothing.
 He fell to the ground and Jason brushed himself off.
 “You okay, Jazell?” he asked me and held out a hand.
 I took his hand and he pulled me up.

The hour is still in progress.
 There is still time and that time is now.
 The world today has far greater opportunities that ever before, far greater degrees of freedom within which to act to accelerate progress and eradicate suffering.
 The Millennium Development Goals adopted at the UN Millennium Summit in 2000 represent the essential minimum needs for building a stable, secure, free and prosperous global community.
 We confront once again an unprecedented opportunity and an unfinished agenda.
 Disappointed by our failure to achieve all that seemed possible or disillusioned by the emergence of new, more dreadful challenges, some may feel prompted to curb mind’s contemplation of the greater potentials, dispense with lofty plans and resign themselves to the slower, circuitous pace of progress that characterized earlier periods.
 That choice would be unfortunate.
 For everything in our experience of the past two decades points to the fact that humankind is now capable of more rapid and radical action to build a better common present and future for all.
 We may have become habituated to the astounding magnitude of the events since 1989 and still feel unsatisfied with the results, but we can no longer deny that we collectively possess the capacity to create the world that we choose to create.
 This is still the hour in which anything can happen, provided we are determined to make it happen.

His lips were the perfect combination of firm and soft, and the heart that'd been all but stopped a second before sped up to heart attack rates, slamming itself against my chest in an effort to get closer to him.
 All of my senses were blending together.
 I couldn't tell if he smelled incredible, tasted like heaven, or if it was all just a side effect of the energy which had gone from tingling to crackling as soon as our faces touched.
 My inhibitions, the ones that'd always kept me from acting on the occasional amorous impulse, evaporated sometime in the first half second, and I found myself with both arms wrapped around his neck, clinging to him with all my strength.
 Later I'd probably claim it was to steady myself against the wave of dizziness, but right now I knew it was because I wanted him more than anything I'd ever experienced.
 Alec pulled me away, held me at arm's length while I gasped for air, and then once I calmed down a little, he smiled and pulled me in close again, just for a hug this time.
 I tried to turn it into a kiss, but he deftly avoided my attempt, burying his face in my hair.
 "I'd like to, I truly would, but I don't think that would be fair to you.
 Even letting that happen was a mistake.
 I've never come so close to losing control."

This project would prove to be a huge challenge that would last seven-plus years, partly because it coincided with the start of Brandon’s drug use.
 What started as a project he was very enthusiastic about became an afterthought to time with friends and partying.
 He would show up for certain monumental events like when we put the body back on the frame after it was painted, but I was pretty much on my own with it for a bit.
 My wife was a champ as “that thing” (her nick-name for it) sat in a million pieces in the garage for so long.
 Seeing Brandon heading down the wrong path, I knew only what not to do.
 I had no idea what to do.
 I remember a lesson I learned while coaching youth sports.
 “The hardest kid to coach is your own.” A true statement.
 I found myself unable to dissuade my eldest son from the dangerous road he would travel.

While you may very well have lost your way, it would have been a small matter for one of the others to track you down.
 You have, if I may say so, a very distinctive smell.
 It reminds me of a type of sage brush that hasn't grown here in quite some time."
 His sigh was more felt than heard, and it put me in mind of mountains, redwoods, and other ancient things.
 "Donovan, can I ask you a question?"
 "Of course, mistress.
 I'm afraid there are many which I won't be able to answer, but it would be a delight to share those things which haven't been forbidden me."
 "You're really old, aren't you?"
 His hesitation was brief, so much so I almost thought I'd imagined it.
 "Yes, Mistress Paige, I'm quite old."

It was stupid, but I couldn't help feeling this was yet another sign I wasn't going to win a ticket.
 I tried to shake the feeling during History, but was still fighting it when I walked into Physics.
 In a departure from his normal routine, Alec was already seated when I arrived.
 I flipped open my notebook and tried to distract myself with a brief sketch, only to tear the page out and ball it up as the bell rang.
 I looked up to see Alec staring at me, which just made me mad.
 It was completely unfair.
 I wasn't going to get to go to Les Misérables, but he was rich enough to fly to New York and book the whole theater.
 As Mrs. Alexander stood up to take roll, a burst of static silenced us all.
 "It's my pleasure to read off the names of the five winners in our drawing for tickets to Les Misérables."
 "The first winner is Pam White."

They were excused from class, walked through the desks that lined the classroom, all eyes following them out the door.
 Their parents stood with the principal ready for their arrival at the office.
 As they entered the room it wasn’t hard to see the anger and disappointment.
 They were from different sides of this small town.
 My father’s dad was a butcher, his wife a seamstress.
 My mother’s dad was an oil rig grunt of American-Indian decent, and his wife, a meek submissive homemaker.
 Neither parent thought the other was good enough for their child, let alone the fact that they were both still children.
 Once the reason for the marriage was revealed, their parents accepted it as best as they could.
 My father’s parents arranged for them to live together in a small home while they finished school and awaited the birth of their baby.
 It was the late fifties and a pregnant teenager was an embarrassment.

 It didn't tell the date of her death.
 That was odd--he was sure it had been in this section.
 His heart began racing as he scanned those pages.
 There was no mention at all of her death--or of her marriage.
 The only information was her date of birth, the names of her parents and brother, and the general family history.
 He knew that the other information had been there before, and after his mind had completely rejected the impossible--that the print had changed when Marie had stepped from 1927 into 2011 (another impossibility)--he rapidly considered the implications of such an impossibility.
 Maybe the information about the rest of her life wouldn't appear until she returned.
 And maybe she wouldn’t marry Davis when she returned.

Not to mention that marked police cars are waiting within striking distance of the retail center.
 I know the cops can hear everything I say so I spare them my nervous singing and limit my comments, fighting my compulsion to curse wickedly at them.
 I’m staring off across the wetlands, connecting with known drug dealers, talking to undercover narcotics officers on my personal cell phone, feeling a wire taped to my body and extending up to my neck, holding a bottle filled with one hundred Oxys in my jacket pocket.
 What brought me here?
 Where did things get so completely fucked up?
 Chapter 8: Boy Meets World I officially moved out of my parents’ home when I was 15 years old, 35 years ago.
 I didn’t have a driver’s license yet, but I had a learner’s permit.
 I had no car and I walked, bummed a ride or hitchhiked if I needed to get someplace like work or high school.
 It was not easy living on my own and finding roommates at such a young age, but I managed.
 After a short stint of crashing on couches or extra bedrooms of several friends, I rented a room at a house with some other kids near my age.

"My business with your father shouldn't take longer than two or three hours.
 You and I can have dinner afterwards and still have plenty of time to do something else.
 What would you like to do?"
 She started to reply, but the waiter arrived then with her salad and his roast beef.
 Picking up her fork, she told Davis, "Dancing.
 Can we go dancing?"
 "Mmm."
 He swallowed a bite of his meat.
 "Did you have any place special in mind?"
 "No.

Art – I never really thought about that.
 I enjoy most of her work when I see it, but I’m not really interested in art or artists.
 I guess I’m one of her fans though.
 Karen – Are you some sort of dirty old man?
 Art – Well you know I usually don’t try to be.
 Why do you ask?
 Have I come across as one?
 Karen – You claim that you’re not an art fan.
 You don’t work for Miss Struan, and you’re not a family member.
 Yet you’re here.

Then he slashed his sword across Seth’s face.
 I saw the thin blue line well up on his cheek.
 Kojas laughed.
 “You can’t beat me; you can never be safe.” Seth pushed himself up and dove for his sword, which was off to the side.
 Kojas flicked his sword down and I saw Seth flinch.
 He looked at his arm in amazement where a deep cut had sliced through his clothes.
 He pressed his fingers on his arm to stop the blood and continued to scoot towards the sword.
 Kojas stepped to the side and blocked his path.
 Seth gazed up at him and I saw his eyes blaze in hate.
 “What do you want?” he snarled.

Seth pulled back and parried Kojas’ swing.
 “Emily, is he okay?” I yelled.
 She looked up and nodded to me.
 I turned back around to see Kojas slash Seth across the stomach.
 That’s when I screamed.
 Seth fell to his knees, holding his midsection.
 His sword fell out of his grip and to the ground.
 Kojas grinned in triumph and kicked Seth to the ground.
 I screamed again, when he didn’t move.
 “At last,” Kojas breathed.

I was suddenly very certain though that I was going to wage that war.
 I couldn't not want him, not love him, any more than he could do less than his best to keep his family from harm.
 Chapter 28 Alec was completely drenched in sweat, and I still wanted to throw myself at him so badly my teeth hurt.
 It shouldn't be possible for someone to look so good dressed in what amounted to little more than loose, extra-stretchy sweatpants.
 "How was training?"
 It was hard to sound casual.
 The urge to kiss him had become almost overpowering in the last few days.
 He knew me better on every level imaginable than anyone outside my immediate family ever had, and all I could think about right now was how much I wanted to touch him.
 "Fairly well, all things considered.
 We took it easy though..." I'd gotten used to the idea that he left a substantial number of thoughts unsaid out of a desire to protect me from knowing too much.

The stinger fell on the ground and dark blood oozed from the cut.
 “Now Jazell!” Seth yelled to me.
 I notched an arrow and took aim at the thrashing belly.
 I pulled the string back and released it.
 The arrow whizzed through the air and sunk into the creature’s belly.
 It shook and fell to the ground.
 Seth ran from underneath it right before it crushed him.
 He turned around and studied it.
 Then there was a horrible sound, like ripping metal.
 The belly of the creature seemed to open up and winds picked up.

Ravenhurr raised his head up from the tube again and scanned the rooftop making sure all the parts of the ceremony were in place.
 Rodregas had always thought that it was only Ravenhurr’s eyes that gave away the fact that what was inside him was not as attractive as his exterior.
 Ravenhurr’s eyes had an intensity about them, a habit of weighing everyone else and finding them wanting.
 Rodregas felt that Ravenhurr saw in everyone else a lesser person whose best function was to be used by his betters.
 Rodregas looked over the rooftop following Ravenhurr’s eyes.
 Most of the open flat roof of the tower was covered in various circles.
 The largest circle held all the others and was made of a glittering white sand-like substance.
 Its diameter had been drawn as large as possible within the limitations of the roof’s edges.
 On the inside were sigils, runes, and small candles set out every few feet.
 Rodregas knew enough of magic to understand that the purpose of this circle was to keep out unwanted magical influences.

Uncle Eddie.
 Aunt Mary.
 Uncle Fenton.
 My other grandma.
 And three high school friends including my best friend Eric.
 After Eric died, I took a vow.
 I would love nobody.
 Then neither death nor desertion could hurt me.
 The attitude worked, except it doomed my marriage and helped make me crazy.
 When Darcy arrived, the sight of her instantly flushed my heart of that vow against loving.

"I don't know.
 Things were already pretty tense.
 That's probably where Alec is right now actually.
 Brandon's people are always skirting around the edge of our territory, but tonight they'll be out in greater numbers than normal.
 If things don't boil over now, it's pretty much guaranteed that there will be some kind of confrontation Monday at school."
 The word confrontation reached out and grabbed me.
 It took a second before I realized it was dragging up memories of the near-fight between Alec and half his pack.
 "What happened last night...it was for real, wasn't it?"
 Rachel didn't ask what I meant; she didn't even bat an eye.
 "I'm afraid so.

They will have the finest equipment that the Guild sorcerers can make or buy.
 While the two of us might be a match for most of the sigil warriors’ one on one, their equipment will make them hard to beat.” “I agree that has to be something we figure out,” Rodregas said, “but, I am actually thinking decent horses might be more important first.” “Horses?
 How will that help us in battle?” asked Doi’van.
 Rodregas responded, “Well, a true trained war horse can help directly, but what I am worried about is escaping after an attack.
 Even if we have a successful raid against an Immortalist, we will need to be far away before a large group of The Immortal Guard can track us down.
 The Immortal Guards, or at least their officers, use Dire Steeds.
 If we are mounted on regular horses and they come after us on Dire Steeds, well, they will track us down and outnumber us the first time we strike.”  Doi’van nodded at that.
 Rodregas had the impression that he had not thought of anything but the actual fight.
 Imeralda said, “Ok, that is all fine.
 You two need to find Dire Steeds and magic armor and weapons before you fight the Immortal Guards.

She nodded toward the t-shirt on the pillow.
 Mrs. Tranton gazed down at her for a moment.
 "I'm sorry, darling."
 She kissed Marie's forehead and left.
 Marie curled up next to Rick's t-shirt still clutching his handkerchief.
 She felt so empty.
 She didn't sleep well that night but woke up early nevertheless.
 After bathing, she put on her emerald underwear and a simple white dress and went out into the garden.
 It didn't look so different from Rick's, she decided.
 They didn't have any white roses like he did, nor an electric fountain, but they had red roses and azaleas, just as he did.

It matched the long cuffs on his forearms, the same dark, worn leather of his saddles.
 He stepped closer, taking my chin in his hand to examine my face in the moonlight.
 He purred something toward Ruby about her decorations and gave me a wink as he walked off in the direction Chevelle had gone.
 We were alone then, Ruby and I, and I was sure this was going to hurt more than my other training.
 She untied her cloak and tossed it to land with a muffled sound on the rocks.
 She was smiling a touch as she reached a hand across her waist, closing her fist around a black hoop I’d not seen before.
 She drew it out and around as a long black trail curved in its wake and came to rest at her side.
 My mouth went dry.
 A whip.
 Oh yes, this would hurt.

I jerked upright.
 My ears were still ringing from the harsh song, but the bird lay dead on the wood planks below the window.
 Chevelle started to turn to find the source of the muffled thump and, before I realized what I was doing, I flicked my right hand and the bird’s body flopped behind a shelf out of sight.
 When Chevelle turned back to me, I stared right into his eyes as if I had not seen or heard a thing, wondering why he wasn’t still explaining the histories of Grah.
 He glanced past me… or maybe at the crown of my head.
 Like he was avoiding my eyes.
 My lying eyes.
 I was too worried about being caught to feel guilty about the bird, to think about its soft gray feathers, that wing that was bent not-quite-right beneath it.
 I didn’t know about where Chevelle was from, but around here you didn’t just kill birds.
 Especially not for singing.

I didn't know what it meant.
 I didn't even know if it was a good thing.
 It made Brandon more intriguing, but he hardly needed any more help there.
 With a sigh of frustration, I walked into Physics, smiled at Mrs. Alexander, and took my normal seat.
 I could pretty much set my watch by Alec's arrival.
 Apparently it wasn't cool to be caught inside a classroom more than fifteen seconds before the bell rang.
 It was a sign of just how far removed from reality I was that he was able to sit down in the other corner before I even realized he'd stepped through the door.
 I realized I must have been woolgathering for longer than I'd thought, and reached for my notebook.
 Only the bell should have rung by now, and it hadn't.
 I looked up at the clock and it confirmed that there was still at least a minute before class started.

He'd probably sat in the garden until he'd known for sure she was gone.
 He might even still be there, hoping she hadn't gone back, that she was lost somewhere in 2011 and would eventually call out to him to come find her.
 Tears began to run down her cheeks.
 She fell asleep and dreamed that she, her parents, her brother, and Rick were at Cape Cod.
 When she awoke a couple of hours later, she felt feverish.
 Frowning, she felt her forehead.
 No .
 .

 When a breeze stirred the curtains, she realized that it was just the heat of a late July afternoon.

“Nothing.
 Just a big stupid half-orc I’m going to miss.
 Bye-bye.”
 She waved and then vanished into the forest.
 For a long time, Harruq remained.
 He ran a hand through his hair and pondered what in the abyss was wrong with him.
 “Never get involved with elves,” he mumbled.
 “Never ever should have gotten myself screwed up like this.”
 But a part of him liked it, and that scared him even more.

The high-pitched scream of pain as Jasmin began trying to crush her opponent's spine was answered by rapidly-approaching howls.
 Vincent attacked with renewed strength at the promise of reinforcements.
 I was bleeding in a dozen places now, but the rage insulated me from pain and weakness.
 Both sides of my nature were united in hating Vincent.
 If I ever did manage to kill him, my questionable humanity wouldn't grieve.
 The world would be better for his absence.
 I could hear the other pack now, panting with exertion, our friends hot on their heels.
 Vincent overreached in his effort to claim the kill, and I sunk my teeth into the muscled flesh of his shoulder as I finally made it around behind him.
 My claws sank into his arms and legs as I repositioned to snap his neck, and then a hammer blow of weight struck me across the shoulders.
 Knocked loose from Vincent, I spun around in time to tear Simon from the air as he leaped at me again.

She was in the process of raising her glass to her lips when her eyes met his.

 She set her glass down.

 I'm not interested in seeing anyone."
 "I know you just broke up with Davis two days ago, but a family dinner--" "It has nothing to do with Davis.
 I just-I just want to be with my family for a while."
 The thought of being courted was revolting.

 Do I have to be sure?

 At least that’s the advice that you’ve given to me for the last ten years.

When the sound reached her, Aurelia knew her doom.
 Velixar was laughing.
 He stood, brushed off pieces of ice clinging to his robes, and then glared at her from afar.
 “Not good enough,” he said.
 Wild anger contorted his face.
 Black lightning thicker than a man’s arm tore down the street.
 Aurelia gasped as all her power flowed into her shield.
 The collision sent her flying, her magical barrier shattered into nothingness.
 The lightning continued, swirling about her body.
 Every nerve in her body shrieked with pain.

Repeatedly.
 I felt all kinds of defeated before we’d gone half an hour.
 After watching us for a while, Steed stepped in to save me.
 “Frey”—he’d converted to the nickname the others used in place of the sunnier ones—“why don’t you take a break for a while?
 Let us spar so you can watch.
 We’ll give you a few pointers.” I didn’t know if I liked the idea of the group sparring, whether it gave me a break from the torture or not, but Grey stepped forward and my opinion no longer mattered.
 “Just watch and learn.” I backed away and sat cross-legged on the ground.
 Ruby joined me; I could tell she was excited.
 It seemed everything excited Ruby.
 Everything that makes me nervous, I amended in my head.

“It is quick, deadly, and strikes from nowhere.
 Listen to these words very carefully.
 If you give it enough of your power, nary a soul can withstand the shock and blood loss.”
 The man in black listed off a stream of seven words.
 Seven times he pronounced them, giving his disciple ample chances to hear the precise, delicate pronunciations and mimic them himself.
 “Prepare the spell with these words in the morning and you may trigger it at any time with but a single word.”
 “And what is that?” Qurrah asked once the words were tucked firmly into his mind.
 “Hemorrhage,” Velixar hissed.
 The frail half-orc smiled, loving the sound.
 Harruq sat nearby.

Which Rodregas admitted was better than the opposite reaction.
 But the horse felt incredibly sluggish compared to his own mount.
 Hopefully, the horses positive qualities would shine in the tournament.
 As Rodregas circled around the courtyard warming up his horse he noticed fewer horses than he expected.
 After Doom Hoof seemed awake he headed over to where Doi’van stood.
 For this competition each squire was allowed a servant to provide support, mostly assistance with equipment, especially fresh lances.
 “Where is everyone?” he asked Doi’van.
 Doi’van did not look up from the ground where he was trying to straighten out a shield without doing more damage and said, “I wondered that myself.
 Apparently most drop out by this point.
 A lot have been injured, especially during yesterday’s sword and shield competition, and many simply quit due to not having any points yet.

I didn't expect for them to tell monster girl off, or that I'd recognize the new voice as belonging to Cassie.
 The first girl was still whimpering.
 It nearly covered up the distant sound of some kind of machinery kicking on and creating a barely-audible two-part growl that made the air shiver.
 "You can't get away with this."
 Cassie's voice was barely recognizable, a tattered shadow of her usual arrogance.
 "I already have.
 I've already told Lucy where she stands with Ben.
 If you get in my way, if you approach him on her behalf, if you even think of acting on any of the hundred things going through your mind right now, I'll kill you too."
 My knees were weak, but I had to get out now.
 For all that I hated Cassie, there was no way this crazy chick would act on her threats when there were three of us to corroborate each other's stories.

I cursed as the stone glanced off my cheek.
 “This isn’t fair,” I complained.
 It seemed he was holding me in place just to strike me.
 “It’s the only way, Freya.
 This is for your protection.” “I highly doubt they will pummel my face with rocks,” I spat out.
 “No,” he said, “they will bind you and burn you alive.” I felt sick.
 A vision of the Grand Council cloaks circling me was convincing enough, but he continued.
 “You will not know their thoughts; you must be ready for any attack.” I nodded, even though part of me was certain there was a less painful way.
 The rock came at me again.
 I couldn’t respond quick enough, couldn’t counter and hold on to a galloping horse in the instant it took him to decide.

“I’ll get you some food,” he said.
 A fire lit beside us as if of its own accord.
 He strode off in search of food, and I sat close, tucking my cheeks into the material of the cloak for warmth.
 A moment later, he was back, our breakfast roasting over the flames.
 We ate in silence and mounted the horses as we had each day before, but it was obvious nothing was the same.
 How could it ever be?
 I was racked with guilt as we made our way up the mountain.
 I purposefully rode behind him, glad at least to be able to control the horse on my own.
 Small patches of snow had started to dot the landscape, the vegetation a darker, sharper green.
 Occasionally the sun would break through the mist, making me squint, and I would appreciate the calmer, hazier atmosphere.

A little.
 I just hate being such an open book to everyone."
 "Try not to let it get to you too much.
 As hard as it may be for you to believe, Alec's even better at reading people than most of us.
 There are several of the pack there at the house who are nearly as bothered by that as you are."
 The familiar feel to her touch suddenly fell into place.
 It was hard to believe that I'd spent so long with her and not realized that she was a shape shifter until she'd said as much.
 "Ah, and the first question you want to know is how come you didn't realize I was a shape shifter, isn't it?"
 I nodded, surprised at her insight, but more or less resigned to the fact that I was never going to have any kind of secret ever again.
 "Partly it's because I'm so old, but it also has a little bit to do with the fact that I've spent the last couple of decades concealing my presence from others.

But they also evoke images of more people and less work – meaning fewer jobs!
 No sooner has the threat of nuclear annihilation receded, than the spectre of chronic unemployment and unrelenting poverty has risen to replace it, giving renewed justification to humanity’s deepest anxieties by transferring them to a new source of apprehension.
 In recent years, unemployment has emerged as a major cause of concern for governments around the world.
 In industrial countries, the subject evokes pessimistic prophecies of a fast-approaching future in which tens of millions of people will never find jobs, technology eliminates the need for human labour, cheap imports replace domestic jobs, welfare systems collapse under an unbearable burden, children have less economic opportunity than their parents, a widening abyss divides the rich and poor, and both markets and governments are powerless to do anything about it.
 In developing countries, it dashes hopes of ever conquering hunger, eradicating wide spread rural and urban poverty, and bridging the gap that separates these nations from the prosperous West.
 The very same deterministic mentality that until recently made us feel that a nuclear war was inevitable now leads many to conclude that rising unemployment, chronic poverty and social alienation are unavoidable.
 Yet the enormous gains of peace and democracy that we contemplate cannot be secured and brought to fruition if this other apprehension is allowed to become a settled reality, as war between nations has been during past millennia.
 The peace and security we seek internationally depend directly on our ability to promote and maintain domestic peace and tranquillity within nations, which in turn are dependent on the ability of countries to provide food and economic security to their people.
 Poverty and unemployment are closely linked to most instances of social unrest – tribal wars, civil wars, urban crime, drugs and violence.
 There is clear evidence from the US and UK that crime is economically related to lack of job opportunities.

Paranoia it might be, but it is justified.”
 Antonil quieted.
 Dieredon watched him, amazed just how young the man could still look in the moonlight.
 He was a year beyond forty, yet he commanded the entire Neldaren army.
 Publicly, he handled the weight wonderfully, but when prying eyes were gone, his all-too-human fear and doubt showed.
 When the man spoke again, his voice trembled.
 “I will not break my oaths.
 His Majesty asked I enforce his edict, and so I shall.”
 Dieredon nodded, the sparkle in his eyes fading.
 “I had hoped otherwise, but follow your oaths and your heart as you must.”

Officer White wants to do a last minute sound check on the wire that I am wearing taped to my back.
 It seems that my lack of noise has caused the undercover officers who surround me in cars, vans and bushes to become concerned that they have lost sound.
 They haven’t heard a word from me since my last crack-berry conversation with Ashley, the suspect that I have set up in exchange for dropping pending drug dealing charges.
 They are not my charges.
 They belong to my son.
 He is the real drug dealer.
 I’m just trying to be a good dad.
 My last conversation with Ashley seemed a little muffled and the cops want to make sure they get a clear recording of the drug deal.
 The reason I am here and have insisted that I do this is complicated.
 I think I am here to save my family the anguish of watching another family member go to jail, not wanting to relive the time I watched my brother Thomas go to a federal prison for dealing drugs many years before.

The man in black gestured to the city nestled against the forest.
 “This city has long been treated neutral, even though it resides within Neldar’s border.
 The elves will not take kindly to removal from a home many have lived in since before our dear king’s grandparents were alive.”
 “I eagerly await the bloodshed,” Qurrah said.
 He bowed to his master.
 “Go.
 The night is young.
 Taint the dreams of the slumbering.”
 Qurrah left Velixar to sit alone before the fire.
 The dark night sang a song of crickets and wind.

The terrible poverty and such just made her desperate to get out of the country.
 Art – Well as long as she’s pretty.
 Other wise, well I can’t imagine that he has much self-confidence left.
 Karen – I’ve seen a couple of pictures, she isn’t.
 Art – Stay in Russia and have no foreseeable future, or come to the United States and marry a stranger who just happens to turn out to be a contributor to the growth of the lesbian community.
 I wonder what would happen to the poor man if she decided to go back to Russia as a lesbian.
 Karen – I don’t know, I hope it never happens to him, my family would make his life hell if they ever found out.
 Art – A good reason to stay away from them.
 I haven’t seen much of my family in years, those people are nuts.
 They’re bizarre on the odd days as well as the even.

In a low voice she said, “They have heard of your return.
 They have come to see for themselves.” Their rulers had burned, along with so many of their families.
 After the massacre, there had been no one.
 From the dead, it seemed, I had returned.
 Chevelle stepped to my right side, placing something cold and heavy in my hand.
 My sword.
 I knew what to do then.
 I took a deep, steadying breath as I raised the blade to the air.
 There was a faint pause, the briefest tick before the bird took flight, its wings hitting wind as the shift began, and then nothing could be heard but my name, roared in the song of the crowd below.

I slowly shook my head, trying to jar something loose enough to figure out who he was.
 "Please, Adriana.
 It really isn't any trouble.
 James, can you get your car, please?"
 He looked angry.
 Like maybe he was going to argue, but as he opened his mouth Rachel turned and glared at him.
 It seemed odd to see someone only a little smaller than Alec back away from someone even smaller than me.
 The image stuck with me so strongly that I considered it until Rachel came over and took my hand.
 "What's wrong?
 It's just the two of us now, you don't have to worry about James, and I won't tell anyone else.

“Stay safe,” Qurrah said, offering a small wave as his brother trudged north.
 When he was gone, the smaller half-orc slipped back into the shed, removed a false floorboard, and grasped a small pouch containing various herbs, bones, and knives.
 Reaching back in again, he took out an object wrapped in sackcloth and soaked in blood.
 A knife in hand, he opened the pouch and closed his eyes.
 His mind attuned, he carved into the remains of a man’s heart.

 [section break](break.png)
 On his way back home, the threepence jingling in his hand, Harruq spotted a patrol of guards approaching.
 He glanced to the right, where the small alley led back to their shed.
 If he hurried, he might be able to make it before they noticed…

"And then summer ended.
 There were so many things left undone.
 I felt as though I had cheated him.
 I thought that while I was growing up all those days I hadn't given him anything.
 But I was wrong.
 He told a friend of ours many months ago that I had made him happier than he'd ever been.
 "I know how hard it was between you.
 Perhaps when two complex people can't live with each other, it's because they need each other so much they hit head on.
 "I have been thinking how important it was for Eric to be free.
 God didn't make him for this world.

 queen.
 But she was back now.
 Davis was her fiancé, and she had no business kissing Rick, no business sitting in his kitchen in nothing but his pajama top.
 Reddening, Marie set her glass down and headed for the stairs.
 “I’m going to take a shower.” She couldn’t believe what she’d done.
 She could almost excuse herself for kissing Rick in Hollywood, say that he’d been part of the dream.
 But this morning .

I also hope this can help people to think about their defining moments and to never give up on their addicted loved ones.
 Expecting someone to just stop being addicted is as absurd as asking someone to stop having cancer.
 These addicts need professional help from those who are trained in this field.
 We are ignorant and ill prepared to help and understand an addict and that ignorance could be deadly.
 We can only pray that these addicts can overcome their addiction and start living a clean and sober life one day at a time.

"Here it is, you've changed the numbers here, it should be fourteen sixty-fifths, not fourteen fifty-sixths."
 Rachel's skin was several shades darker than mine, tan enough that it didn't show embarrassment as easily, but it still looked like she'd gone the slightest bit red.
 "Oh, I'm sorry to bug you with such a stupid mistake."
 "Don't worry about it.
 I'm just glad it was that easy.
 I've been worried all day someone would stump me on something right out of the gate on my first day."
 Rachel looked up at me through dark lashes as I stood.
 "I've wanted to say thanks for a while.
 I really appreciate you making Cassie back down yesterday.
 Nobody else has ever stood up for me like that.

He knew they were not good, but his mind did not spin with the odds.
 He simply focused on the rightness of Doi’van’s words.
 Trying to attack an armed keep probably had far worse odds, and for what?
 So that they could steal horses; so that they could better their odds to escape a future fight?
 Here, if they succeeded, the three would not be stealing horses, they would be freeing people from slavery.
 Rodregas looked into Doi’van’s eyes.
 He was resolute.
 Rodregas felt humbled at the man’s bravery, at his passion, at his strength.
 Rodregas knew there was no such thing as a hero,  simply people that sometimes choose to do the right thing when it was a hard choice.
 There was no question for Doi’van, he simply stood quiet and ready.

 She put her hands on his chest and pushed away.

 You hate to go both Saturday and Sunday."
 "But you love it."
 He took her hand, pressing his lips into her palm.

Environment: Unsustainable lifestyles and consumption (in industrial countries) and population growth, along with rising levels of production and consumption (in developing countries), will place strenuous demands on the environment of the planet.
 Growing damage to the basic life support systems of soil, water, flora, fauna and the atmosphere is taking place in all parts of the world.
 Unemployment: In the West, rising levels of unemployment have increased resistance to free trade and immigration.
 Rising levels of long-term unemployment and youth unemployment in inner cities are associated with the increasing incidence of crime.
 In developing countries, rapid population growth continues to outpace job creation in most regions, resulting in high levels of unemployment, increasing social unrest and large scale migration from rural to urban areas and internationally.
 Gender discrimination: Gender remains a major determinant of privilege and discrimination worldwide.
 Women still suffer from unfavourable sex ratios, lower wages and restraints on property owner ship, as well as higher levels of illiteracy and lower educational attainments.
 Rising violence: Violence is on the increase, especially violence within society in the form of civil wars, crime and drugs.
 During the first half of 1994, 36 armed conflicts were in progress.
 During the past year, more than half a million people perished in Somalia and Rwanda alone.

Raising awareness internationally
 Public opinion is an even more important determinant at the international level, since the authority of global institutions is still quite limited.
 Rising ethnic and nationalistic sentiments threaten the integrity of states and impede progress toward regional cooperation and global governance in many countries, because their populations lack reliable information regarding the enormous costs of political and economic fragmentation.
 The global debate over the Uruguay Round of GATT has been obscured by lack of clear information regarding its impact on the countries involved.
 International negotiations on debt, aid and the environment are complicated by lack of awareness about the opportunities that greater economic integration will generate for all nations.
 International institutions, non-governmental agencies and the international media play an important role in providing information to the world community, but there are still huge gaps to be filled in all fields.
 A conscious and systematic effort is required at the international level to put in place both the institutions and the technology for information superhighways needed to support peace, democracy and sustainable development in the twenty-first century.
 Building Social Organization for Development
 The achievement of peace, food security and full employment cannot be accomplished without more fully utilizing one of the most creative and productive of all human resources – organization.
 The march of humanity is marked by the development of larger-scale, more complex and more efficient types of organizations to serve higher and wider social needs.

The elf dove, rolling underneath the barrage.
 Not an arrow had hit earth before the elf tucked his feet and kicked.
 The blades sprang from his bow.
 He crossed the distance between the two in a heartbeat.
 Velixar accepted a stab deep into his chest.
 A pale hand grabbed Dieredon’s throat, its grip iron and its flesh ice.
 “It will be painful,” Velixar said.
 Vile magic swirled about his hand, pouring into Dieredon’s neck.
 The blood in his veins clotted and thickened.
 A toss of his hand and the elf flew through the air.

By the time I surfaced from my musings, Mrs. Pendely had printed my schedule out on an ancient piece of machinery, handed me a map of the school and a locker assignment, and then dashed off a handwritten note to my first teacher.
 I somehow found my first class before the bell rang.
 Mrs. Sorenson, my biology teacher, was a skinny old woman with curly white hair that looked like Greek paintings of Medusa.
 She made me introduce myself to the class and then let me slink over to my assigned seat.
 I left the class even more depressed than I'd been when I woke up.
 I'd kind of known I'd have an incredible amount of material to catch up on from the first part of the semester.
 I hadn't anticipated that every other student was going to spend the class carefully ignoring me.
 I'd never really fit in, but this was unbelievable.
 New students could always count on someone to offer to be their friends.
 I'd seen it a dozen times before as people had moved in.

During the last ten years, Indonesia has succeeded in bringing down the consumption of chemical pesticides without adversely affecting grain production through the nationwide adoption of integrated pest management systems for food crop protection.
 India has launched a massive national training programme to popularize bio logical methods of pest control, which can reduce the consumption and cost of chemical pesticides by 50 to 75 per cent.
 Public education programmes of this type are needed at the national and international level to disseminate information about chemical-free methods to producers and to educate consumers in developed and developing countries about both the health and environmental benefits of organically grown produce.
 9.Inland aquaculture.
 Depletion of deep sea fishery resources has resulted in a significant decline in world harvests from the sea.
 Proven technology is available for substantially replacing sea-grown fish with fresh or salt water pond-grown varieties.
 The new intensive and semi-intensive methods of cultivation can generate yields 10 to 100 times higher than traditional extensive methods.
 Due to the warmer climate and lower labour costs of the developing world, inland aquaculture can become a major stimulus to rural employment, incomes, processing industries and exports.
 10.Micro-level indicators of food security.
 Development initiatives have been severely limited by the absence of accurate and sensitive measures to assess the impact of national-level policies and programmes on food security at community and household level.

At first we were gonna do it on Frank’s Straight label but he was going through some business hassles at the time.
 So it came out on Laughing Buddha Jesus Phallus, this really underground Frisco label, started, I think, by Dino Valenti.
 Maybe not.
 Anyway, we did this heavy piece as a kind of lark—I was pissed, I admit by all the dismissals I was getting in the rock press, all the accusations of sell-out.
 So I did this little 45, this really wild piece of music—that’s a Stratocaster I’m playing but filtered through this mini-moog that Underwood brought with him.
 And damned if it wasn’t a hit.
 We didn’t even have a back for it, you know, a flipside.
 So I quickly wrote “Stately Plump Buck Mulligan” as a 12-bar blues, and we sort of adlibbed it in the studio.
 One take.
 Anyway, you heard it here first.

This is no sorcerer we fight.” The voice was from his present combatant, the only one who had proven to be dangerous to him.
 “She is right,” Rodregas said, “I am not Ravenhurr.” “We don’t know that,” challenged another voice from the dark.
 As he stepped forward he recognized the shape of the large aggressive man that Rodregas had first thought was the leader.
 “If he is not Gerald, then he must be Ravenhurr.” There was a silent response to that statement, but finally one of the other men lit a torch and held it up.
 Rodregas quickly realized that in front of him were five of the eight prisoners who had been held in the dungeon.
 “How did you track me here?” Rodregas asked.
 The one with the torch waved it over toward the lone female of the group, the half AElfin maiden from the tower.
 “I am afraid you are not much of a woodsman, not that it is easy to hide wagon tracks,” she stated, her voice hinting disapproval at his skill.
 “Still, it was far too easy, even though my people do not count me as one of their better trackers.” Rodregas thought of asking her if she was referring to her AElf or her Nymph heritage as her people, but decided it was best not to ask.
 He had to admit she had a very nice soft voice to go along with that killer body and exotic look.

Poverty and unemployment are closely linked to most instances of social unrest – tribal wars, civil wars, urban crime, drugs and violence.
 There is clear evidence from the US and UK that crime is economically related to lack of job opportunities.
 Unemployment is also a major cause of massive migrations, both to urban areas within countries and across borders, which has become a highly destabilizing factor in many regions.
 Without sufficient purchasing power for food and other material essentials and non-essentials, there can be no assurances of lasting social peace and political stability.
 The linkage between peace, political stability and economic development will be even stronger in the future than in the past, due to the democratic and social revolutions that are in the course of encompassing the globe.
 The greater access to information and freedom of expression which characterize democratic societies and the rising expectations of people at lower economic levels combine to generate a powerful pressure on society to provide economic opportunities as well as social freedoms to every citizen.
 If the greater freedom and higher expectations are unable to find means for their positive fulfilment, they can lead to rising frustration, tension and violence, which threaten the prosperity of those at higher levels and the stability of the society as a whole.
 Democracies can only thrive and the revolution of rising expectations can only fulfil itself peacefully, when economic opportunities are provided to every human being.
 The recent rise of the political right, ethnic unrest and opposition to immigration in Western Europe, and the surge of crime in the United States, are sufficient evidence of the corrosive impact that unemployment can have, even on mature democracies.
 Increasingly, those excluded from the benefits of modern society reject its standards of justice and ignore its laws.

He spoke as if they had met at a box social.
 And he kept asking, “What can we do?” As if our mission was to fix all the world’s broken people.
 Eric was the fastest middle-distance runner in our school.
 Baseball was my best game.
 But Eric and I had alienated some coaches.
 Me for quitting the baseball and football teams, soon after my dad died, so I could go instead to Singing Hills, a country club where Tommy Rupnik, a golf pro and friend of my dad’s let me play for free.
 Most every day, I traipsed through the woods alongside a stream and clobbered golf balls.
 Eric had angered coaches for walking away from the wrestling team after he lost a match and Coach Feezer belittled him.
 The coaches believed Eric had quit out of wounded pride.
 The truth was, disappointing people wracked him with shame.

You can turn your horse and guide him on the path, but that is simply pushing their heads and encouraging them with the click of your heels.
 You can’t make them choose to take you; it just doesn’t work that way.
 You can’t get into an animal’s mind and make them behave the way you want them to.” “But the dogs… wolves… follow them.
 They had them do a demonstration and—” “No, Frey.
 The wolves do not follow the elves.
 The wolves protect them by choice.” “By choice?” “Yes.
 And I have seen them tear an elf apart as quickly as defend them.” I shivered.
 “Rhys and Rider were saved by the wolves once.
 They think the animals understand.
 They follow the wolves, you see.

Aurelia, meanwhile, absently drew lines in the dirt.
 He watched for a moment, suddenly nervous and quiet.
 The words of his brother echoed in his head.
 “Aurry?” he asked.
 “You said most elves remember when men were created…‌do you know how orcs were made?”
 The elf looked at him.
 She was trying to read him, Harruq could tell, but he endured it without protest.
 “When Ashhur and Karak warred, there were elves that sought to end it,” she said.
 “Against Celestia’s orders, they joined Karak, hoping their aid would finally end the conflict.
 When our goddess imprisoned the two gods, she cursed those elves.

They were killing the final hour before dark.
 Then they would hoist the wrapped body onto Harruq’s shoulder and sneak out of town.
 Qurrah sat meditating in a corner while Harruq yammered to himself.
 The blade was in one hand, the decorative scabbard in the other.
 “He was a skilled swordsman,” Qurrah said.
 “He was also arrogant.
 I would expect such a blade from one like him.”
 Harruq shrugged.
 “If I didn’t have my own two swords, I’d use it.”
 The half-orc cut the blade through the air a few times and then sheathed it.

Suddenly he knew, and he looked at Aurelia in total disbelief.
 “Is that a book?”
 The elf nodded.
 “Is it a safe assumption that you don’t know how to read?”
 Harruq frowned at the book.
 “You’re not going to teach me elvish, are you?”
 Aurelia gave him a playful jab to the side.
 “No, it is in the gods’ language, your gods anyway.
 Karak and Ashhur got something right having humans speak and write the same language.”

"You're different from the others then?
 I mean, they can't change into cats, can they?"
 She shook her head, attention still mostly on the fighting taking place on the far end of the sand court.
 "We're from different bloodlines.
 If you believe the legends, Adjam became the first wolf, and Inock the first of the big cats.
 Alec and the others descended from Adjam, and I'm a descendant of Inock."
 It all seemed so impossible, legends brought to life and paraded before my incredulous eyes, and yet there was no arguing with the truth.
 It was starting to sink in that I needed to come to terms with all of the natural implications.
 Things like the fact that some or all of my attraction to Alec was based on his ability to addict humans to him, intentionally or not.
 James and Jessica were squared off against Alec now while Isaac and Jasmin watched.

 He watched her play for a couple of minutes and then headed back toward the blanket.
 Marie ran after him.
 "Don't you want to play?"
 she asked, clinging to his arm.
 "No."
 She could tell he was angry.
 "What's wrong?"
 "Nothing."

It's barely 7:00."
 She pushed away from him, looking up at him anxiously.
 "How are you feeling?"
 "OK." "I haven't had a chance to make breakfast.
 Since it's so early, why don't I do that before we go out to the garden?"
 He started to say that he wasn't hungry, but he wanted to put off her walk in the garden as long as possible.
 So he helped her make breakfast and then managed to swallow most of his.
 Out in the garden, he took her hands, gazing down at her.
 "I won't kiss you like I did yesterday.
 But I want you to know how very much I love you."

 CM:  	Right.
 BG:  	High school was a strange trip.
 I found myself popular after years of feeling like my nose was pressed against the glass.
 And I got myself a girlfriend for the first time.
 A cheerleader!
 (laughs)  She thought my music was from the angels, man.
 And we went at it, you know, it was a real relationship, even that young.
 Hell, we were kids.
 But, when I wasn’t writing, playing, I was with her—let’s call her Debbie because every girl back then was named Debbie—in front of her house, practicing our manumission, handjobs and fingerings and oral sex.

Rodregas could not help but think about how out of his depth he was trying to interfere with the ritual ceremony.
 However, as he forced the beautiful woman forward, the woman whose name he had refused to learn, he knew he was indeed going to try.
 “I will do it this time,” Rodregas thought to himself, “This time I will not choose my survival over others.” His life was not worth living if he did nothing again; he wanted to feel at least a small measure of being the man he had been raised to be.
 “Celestial Gods, please let my life be worth something in death, if not in life,” he prayed quietly.
 Captain Poir and Rodregas carefully put the two prisoners in the middle of their circles, and then stepped out.
 They each picked up small wooden clubs.
 Dale and Junnit stood across from the two of them holding matching clubs.
 The ceremony required the prisoners to stay in each circle unbound.
 The job of the guards was to remain outside the circle but make sure that the prisoners stayed inside.
 Metal would interfere with the magic so the guards held simple wooden clubs and wore only linen clothes with no metal fastenings.

Her eyes were closed, her face still flushed.
 He knew that she wanted him, and he didn't think she'd respond to his touches and kisses the way she always did if she didn't love him.
 He could make her happy if she stayed here with him.
 They'd get married and make love day and night.
 And soon they'd have children.
 She'd have a family here, and that would make up for the family she had in 1927.
 They swam and played in the surf, but Marie thought Rick seemed very sober.
 Did he think she was still angry with him?
 Maybe he wasn't feeling well.
 Taking his hand as they returned to their blanket, she asked, "Are you feeling all right, Rick?"

The lower prices result in increased demand, greater consumption, higher levels of production and even greater cost reductions due to economies of scale.
 This represents only the first cycle of job creation.
 While jobs are being eliminated in low-skilled manual or assembly operations, simultaneously they are being created in industries that manufacture and service the more sophisticated machines, as well as in Research and Development (R &D) laboratories that develop the new machines, materials and manufacturing processes.
 The workers who operate the improved machines require higher levels of skill, which demands more education and training, thus creating demand for jobs in the service sector.
 The more productive and higher-paid industrial workers utilize their enhanced purchasing power to buy more goods and services than before – spending more on travel, consumer goods, housing, leisure, health and the education of offspring, and thus creating demand for more jobs in other industries.
 Rising incomes generate higher standards and expectations, bringing changes in lifestyle that create new needs and new commercial activities.
 This process has led to enormous growth in new jobs.
 The best documented example of this process is the automotive industry.
 Inspired by the idea of making a car the working-class masses at the turn of the century could afford, Henry Ford adopted new manufacturing technology, the automated assembly line, to produce the first low-priced automobile.
 Ford’s technology increased worker productivity more than seven-fold and reduced production costs by two-thirds.

Mrs. Tiggs turned on one of the Spanish TV channels within thirty seconds of class starting.
 Towards the end of the hour I finally started to come back out of my funk, so I put the last few minutes to good use reviewing vocabulary for the quiz on Tuesday.
 I felt a momentary surge of relief when class ended, but the feeling evaporated when I remembered I had to go to math tutoring.
 I grabbed my math book, and met an equally morose Britney at her locker.
 There are only so many times one person can say something sucks, and expect the other person to agree with them.
 Britney quickly used up her allotment of complaints, and then subsided into silence as she led the way to an out-of-the-way corner of the old school.
 I'd noticed Britney liked to position herself so she was closest to the middle of the hall.
 Admittedly, dodging all the people trying to get into their lockers wasn't much fun, but I suspected her real motivation was a desire to ensure she could see and be seen, which was much more easily accomplished by relegating me to the outside position.
 Normally I'd have just viewed her theatrics with amusement, but it'd been a long day and I wasn't in the mood.
 If I'd known for sure where we were heading, I'd have considered cutting her off, even with all of the probable fallout, but I didn't.

I pushed on the door and then the next thing I knew, I was waking up on the floor with the restroom door against my side, propping it open like a bag of sand, half of my body in the restroom and half out in the hall.
 After splashing some water in my face I returned as if nothing had happened, but I knew and I suspected that Lisa did too.
 Shortly thereafter, we entered the hospital in first time frantic labor.
 We were calmly directed to the “birthing room.” There was no turning back.
 There is no way to describe this to anyone who has not witnessed a birth.
 Those that have, know exactly what I am saying.
 When my boy let out his first cry, I was so relieved and amazed.
 He was perfect.
 A boy.
 My boy.

In the absence of legal channels of protest, opposition parties have frequently resorted to violence.
 By the end of the 1980s the lack of material progress and the emergence of young educated professionals in leadership positions had fostered, on the one hand, a revolt against single-party rule and, on the other, popular pressure for multi-party democracy that have together resulted in a democratic domino effect, similar to the spread of communist rule which Western democracies had feared would overwhelm South Asia twenty years ago.
 As recently as 1989, only four African countries could be considered stable democracies and three more were moving in that direction.
 Only three years later, 18 African nations could be classified as democratic and a number of others were in the midst of far-reaching political change.
 The peaceful end of apartheid in South Africa is one remarkable outcome of this process.
 There are even winds of change in the Middle East, where Jordan has recently shown the way by conducting free elections.
 The role of democracy in development would be even more compelling were it not for the apparently contradictory evidence posed by the recent experience of Russia and China.
 Russia hastened to introduce democratic reforms in the hope that they would lead to rapid economic advancement.
 China preferred to postpone political reforms until the economic transition was much further advanced.
 As an immediate result, China has the highest economic and employment growth rates among the nations of the world, while Russia has experienced three successive years of steeply declining national income.

Rodregas knew that if Ravenhurr had ever thought he had more than basic magic training he would long have been reassigned to a duty far from the ceremony.
 The very air seemed to strum like a stringed instrument with the gathered magical power.
 Rodregas could not help but think about how out of his depth he was trying to interfere with the ritual ceremony.
 However, as he forced the beautiful woman forward, the woman whose name he had refused to learn, he knew he was indeed going to try.

In Eastern Europe, where a peaceful revolution from within has broken the shackles of statism that long confined the energies of people, these energies now surge forward in high and eager expectations of a better life.
 Already there are growing signs of impatience, disappointment and frustration arising from the greater hardships that have come in place of the greater benefits that all expected.
 It is essential that these energies be channelled into constructive pursuits that generate tangible improvements.
 Otherwise they may recoil from the effort and look backwards to a failed system or be guided by false prophets on a path that once again poses a threat to other nations.
 The phenomenon of growing violence in an age of increasing affluence seems to contradict the thesis that poverty is one of the major causes of violence, until we realize that the increasingly visible signs of prosperity the world over raise the expectations and aggravate the sense of deprivation and revolt among those that have been by-passed by the general progress.
 Greater political and social freedom can only further magnify this tendency.
 This suggests that violence at the international, national and community levels cannot and will not be eradicated before poverty itself has been abolished, and that, if poverty is left unaddressed at its source, further economic progress is likely further to aggravate conflict in society, unless we are able to extend the benefits of progress to everyone.
 This realization would be quite disconcerting were it not for the fact that we are fast approaching the time when both these persistent ills of humankind can be banished forever – the way slavery and colonialism were banished in the past.
 The recognition that it is neither desirable nor possible to go backwards adds urgency to our efforts to move forward.
 Revolutions of the past have been partial and localized negative reactions against an existing social order, and benefited only a small part of society that, in turn, blindly resisted change.

Alec put me down with a slight start as soon as he saw his sister.
 I reluctantly let go of him, and covered the last few feet under my own power.
 I gave Rachel a hug as soon as she was within arm's reach.
 "I'm so sorry.
 I've been incredibly dumb."
 She waved the explanation away.
 "Brandon's fooled people smarter than both of us put together.
 The hardest part was not being able to tell you anything."
 Alec started to open the door, but Rachel put a hand on his arm.
 "The rest of the pack is back.

he asked as he walked her back to the house.
 Last night it had occurred to him that she might feel more inclined to stay in 2011 if she had friends here.
 "All right."
 She looked up at him.
 "Are you going to tell her about me?"
 "What do you mean?"
 "Are you going to tell her I'm from 1927?"
 "Are you kidding?
 She’d think I’d lost my mind.
 I'll just tell her that you're my girlfriend."

“But still, I would travel with you.” Again he made the statement and showed no interest in explaining his action.
 “Actually,” added Imeralda shaking her long curly hair behind her as if to clear the way for her decision, “I was thinking the same thing.
 I am not safe from the Guild anyhow.
 My natural magical talent is very strong, and until I am better skilled in it, I am very vulnerable,” she stated “And frankly, while Audrian, Brit and Geor are very brave to let me travel with them, I fear that I put their lives in danger.
 You, on the other hand, are in more danger than I am, and should be even more motivated to stay out of the sight of the Guild.” After saying the little speech that she had clearly been practicing in her head, she added, “Joining you makes sense.” Rodregas hesitated, but she had an excellent point, and of course turning away such a beautiful young woman was a difficult thing to do.
 She did have a point and he did have a reasonably safe place to hide that he had been heading toward.
 So, even if he did head out on a raid of the Immortalists, she should be safe enough.
 The human men would be of least interest to the Guild and the easiest to blend in.
 On the other hand, while the Hellborn were feared and disliked, the Immortalists should not be interested in Doi’van.
 He was also clearly a gifted warrior and between the two of them they would make a dangerous duo.

It has been generally assumed that the transition now taking place in Eastern Europe will sooner or later lead these countries to adopt forms of government and economy identical to those prevalent in the West.
 But for those raised in a society that offered a great measure of social security, the poverty and insecurity of the Western system are gross inadequacies.
 While it is clear that these new democracies have rejected the authoritarian statist system, it is not yet clear what finally they will accept, discover or invent as a more acceptable alternative.
 The creativity and inventiveness they have exhibited in seeking an alternative in the past may quite possibly lead them to discover that better social system which both East and West are in need of.
 Viewed from an evolutionary perspective, we may surmise the general direction and likely destination of that quest.
 The requirements of the state and the market must eventually give way to the needs of people.
 The values of authority and money must be supplanted by acceptance of the fundamental value of the human being.
 Human welfare and well-being must become the central determinants of social policy, in place of the compulsions of the centrally controlled state bureaucracy and the decentralized market pricing mechanism.
 The first essential step in that direction is a commitment by market economies to guarantee the right of every citizen to employment.
 Neither the mechanism of state planning and control nor the mechanism of market prices can accomplish this on their own.

“As an Ambassador to the knighthood I, of course, have no favorites.
 Though as one who works to join the Celestials in the Heavens, I do have an abiding dislike for anything that smells of the Infernal.” His voice was smooth, very reasonable, and intolerably smug.
 Rodregas spoke before he could help himself, “Really?
 Because I heard that you and Taiga rather liked the smell of the Infernal.
 In fact, I heard that it smells very familiar to you.” Rodregas immediately felt ice in his belly; he knew his hint at such knowledge was enough to turn Van’dret fully against him.
 The Immortalist’s eyes blazed with fury and Rodregas had no problem thinking that the Infernal Realms were reflected in those cold eyes.
 Strangely, it was the one who looked the part of an Infernal Daemon that broke the tense moment.
 Doi’van casually stood up and said, “This is the best I can do with this shield and here is your lance.” The Hellborn promptly handed Rodregas the items.
 As Rodregas sat on his horse juggling the gear Doi’van finished with, “Now stop teasing the nice Ambassador and go win a pretty ribbon.” His voice managed to be light and teasing even though it was deep enough to vibrate rock.
 Rodregas realized his best move was to go quickly, before the angry looking sorcerer could act, and he moved Doom Hoof around and into line.

And, you know, we didn’t wear any clothes—this was summer and it was beautiful out on that porch—and we became known as the naked hippie couple—among the other cabins spread out along the river.
 Not that we talked to anyone, but they were aware of us, apparently.
 And, of course, there were binoculars trained on Lor, as she walked around in the nude.
 (laughs)  But, man, that was my only comfort, my woman, her body, her sweet, enveloping body.
 She suckled me like I was a child—she has these breasts, well, sorry—anyway, we did a lot of fucking, you know, the kind you do until you cry yourself to sleep.
 We fucked in the cold water of the river which ran right below the cabin, standing up, man, cold as hell, I held her up and entered her right there, in front of God and everybody.
 It was heaven.
 It was hell.
 I was empty man, as empty as a skull.
 And Lor brought me back.

I have had people call Harruq and Qurrah evil.
 Perhaps you agree.
 Much of what they have done certainly is evil.
 I will not sit here and justify the deaths of children, and to do so would paint me a psychopath and my characters sick beings.
 I view Velixar as sort of a recruiter, the kind of man who’d be right at home at a Nazi rally filling confused kids with bigotry, anger, and murder.
 He is gone, for now anyway, and in The Cost of Betrayal these two brothers will get a chance to live on their own.
 For once Harruq has not only felt regret but done something about it.
 For once Qurrah has seen that the darkness he follows is not the absolute power it claims to be.
 This Half-Orc Series is a story of redemption.
 I will not tell it in just one book, not even in two or three.

I was in shock as he knelt, not under his own power, and was frozen there before us.
 How could I have seen him?
 Chevelle mumbled something and my ears began to ring, distracting me from bewilderment.
 It was only a few stuttered heartbeats before recognition came.
 “Stop!” I hissed.
 All eyes turned to me, but I glared at Chevelle.
 “Stop,” I repeated.
 He understood.
 My ears ceased ringing, my hearing cleared.
 I stepped forward, the rage still fuming.

The next morning is sunny, the only dry day I will see while in Portland, according to the weather report.
 So Bob and I head out for a day of whacking golf balls into the marshes beneath some snowcapped peaks across the Columbia River in Washington.
 Because Portland’s main attractions are its brewery pubs, after golf we stop at one of them.
 On two of the too many televisions is the women’s college softball World Series.
 I watch the pitchers, studying their moves.
 Zoë is a softball pitcher too.
 She was the ace of her eight and under team.
 The season just ended a few weeks ago.
 For a project in her second grade class, she wrote and illustrated a book, which her teacher bound, entitled The Fast Friendly Pitcher’s Bad Remembering Day.
 I suppose if I live another thirty years, my eyes will still mist when I think of my girl as the fast friendly pitcher.

Britney's innocuous words shouldn't have caused my mind to immediately sink back to the terror I'd felt this morning, but they did.
 For a moment I couldn't focus on what Britney was saying, my heartbeat had become completely erratic from the surge of adrenaline flooding my body as it futilely tried to escape the nameless things that'd been snapping at my heels.
 "...out in the south end of Zions.
 It was Mark Childs and Lessi Arnolds.
 The bodies were a couple of days old by the time search and rescue found them, but it was pretty obvious they'd been mauled by something."
 I opened my mouth to interrupt, but my vocal chords weren't working.
 Now that she'd finally broached the subject, Britney was unstoppable.
 "It had to have been a mountain lion, there isn't anything else around here that's both aggressive and big enough to kill people, but neither of them had been gnawed on at all, which was strange enough by itself.
 Everyone refusing to talk about it would've been enough to make it X-Files weird, but when the coroner threw such a fit, it entered a class of its own."
 Britney looked around again to make sure nobody was in hearing range, and then leaned in even closer.

He still cut through crowds, but people weren't moving out of his way out of deference anymore.
 Instead they were dodging away to avoid being run over.
 I felt the fine hair on the back of my neck stand on end, but was distracted by Alec's return before I could figure out what else had changed about Brandon.
 Jasmin pulled Rachel to her feet, and gently pushed her towards Alec before casually taking a seat next to me.
 It was a careful act.
 I'd spent way too much time with the pack to believe any of them had failed to notice Brandon's entrance.
 My gaze wandered back to where Vincent and Cassie were arrogantly walking through the door.
 Where Brandon had chosen a fairly traditional black tux, Vincent had selected a silvery masterpiece that probably cost only half as much as the former's outfit, but which practically screamed for attention.
 Cassie trailed along half a step behind Vincent, in a gray evening gown that was equal parts material and skin.
 Backless and strapless, combined with some fairly daring cutouts.

It was like I couldn't win.
 If Britney drove all the way out here and I was already gone because I'd taken the bus, she was going to be really mad.
 On the other hand, if she didn't show, I had no other way to get to school, and Mom would freak out.
 Part of the reason she felt like she could be gone so much ever since the accident was the fact that I always did the responsible thing.
 If she started thinking I was cutting class, she was going be furious.
 It would be like I was behaving irresponsibly and taking away her ability to pursue her art, all at the same time.
 It was past time for the bus to arrive, and she still wasn't here.
 A car zipped around the corner driving way too fast, just like Britney always did, but it wasn't white.
 I looked past it, hoping to see another one following it.
 My mouth nearly hit the ground when I recognized the throaty roar and dark paint job of Brandon's Mustang.

The necessity for understanding and addressing these issues as a complex whole rather than as disparate and independent parts has been an underlying principle of our work.
 From the outset, it has been our intention to build upon the work of previous international commissions that have done so much to generate greater public awareness and support for coordinated global action.
 This report contains specific operational strategies for implementing many of their recommendations.
 Much of their work can come to fruition in the changed international climate, if only we shift the emphasis from preoccupation with cataloguing the problems to focusing on the opportunities available to eliminate them.
 The work of an independent, self-constituted commission has the advantage of being unfettered by the necessity of conforming to any official policy lines.
 It is also faced with the challenge of making a real further contribution on issues which engage so many excellent minds and institutions world wide.
 In formulating the ideas and recommendations incorporated in this report, it has been our objective to avoid utopian and idealistic prescriptions that are incapable of being translated into practice in the foreseeable future.
 At the same time, we have refused to be confined by what is presently considered realistic and practicable, because both intuition and recent experience confirm that our conception of what is real and achievable are themselves often the expression of limited and short-sighted perceptions.
 Disclaimer
 Due to the diversity and complexity of the views examined by the Commission, and the heterogeneous mix of Commission members drawn from a wide range of countries, backgrounds and professions, it has not been possible to arrive at consensus on all the views discussed in this report.

He scrutinized me, and I resisted the urge to straighten my hair and brush the dirt from my clothes.
 “Don’t be shy.” The stranger beckoned, gesturing to an upturned log beside the fire.
 The meat sizzled and popped as I crossed to him and sat obediently.
 It was too late to hide; I might as well at least have something decent to eat.
 Its smell was unfamiliar, but I didn’t care.
 It smelled like food.
 He reached down and tore a hunk from the spit, tossing it to me with a wink.
 When I blushed, he smiled a wicked smile.
 My mouth went dry.
 He was tall and broad with dark hair and eyes.

Then I saw the incredibly beautiful rose on our porch.
 I picked it up, trimmed the bottom inch or so off with a knife, and got it into some water acting out of nothing more than pure habit.
 Dad had always kept at least a pair of rose bushes alive.
 He'd loved nothing more than giving Mom roses.
 Once I'd safely done my part to help prolong the future life of the gorgeous specimen, I got down to really examining it.
 I was far from an expert on roses, but I'd looked through pictures of hundreds of different kinds of tea roses, and never seen anything quite like this one.
 It was as big as some of the largest specimens I'd seen, and had at least fifty percent more petals than most of the 'very full' varieties I was familiar with.
 That in and of itself was pretty amazing, but nothing in comparison to the petals themselves.
 They were the purest white edged in a breathtaking purple.
 Equally amazing was just how velvety they were.

Jim – You’re not going to go on about the birds and the bees are you?
 Art – I wasn’t planning on it.
 Jim – Good, cause you gave me that speech when I was nine.
 Art – I was planning on hitting the finer points of the fairer sex.
 I’ve figured that you already know what breasts look like.
 Well on to more important things.
 Can you tell when a girl is interested in you?
 Jim – Nope.
 Wouldn’t she just say something if she was?
 Art – I’ve never had it happen to me, most of them seem to want to be chased, but for the most part our culture has taboos against women chasing men.

I giggled.
 Evelyn shot a glower at me.
 And then she whirled, storming away, and as she glanced back, her parting expression was so priceless I wished I could see it again.
 “Achoo!” “Choo!” “Hachoo!” My ears popped as I burst out with laughter.
 Evelyn began to run toward town and I couldn’t stifle it, despite the fact that it was absurd something as insignificant as a sneeze would give me such pleasure.
 I wondered briefly how I’d delight in a choking fit and then tugged the lobe of my ear as it popped again.
 Apparently I wasn’t used to laughing.
 I strode off toward home, taking the long route despite my good humor.
 As I approached the old tree, its twisted and gnarled limbs reaching into a cloudless gray sky, I caught sight of an aged elf leaving.
 My stomach dropped; it was a Council member.

All that groove.
 She comes from the Midwest.
 She comes from nowhere.
 That’s what she says.
 I don’t know where she went or she’d tell you, but it was her idea to come out here and it’s worked out great, man.
 I mean, look at this.
 Look at the work I’m doing.
 I’ve never been so content.
 CM: 	Contentment is good.
 BG:  	That’s a question?

They fought until both collapsed against trees, sweat soaking their bodies.
 “You’re starting to get the hang of it,” Harruq said after their fifth session.
 “Don’t flatter me,” Aurelia said, refastening one of her braids that had come loose.
 “You’re still going too easy.”
 “If I move too fast you won’t learn anything,” Harruq insisted.
 “How do you know?” she asked.
 “Do you train elves often?”
 The half-orc grinned.
 “All the time.
 I’m known for it, in fact.

 Liz – What’s his problem?
 Jim – I’m not sure, I think mom fed him lead paint chips when he was a kid.
 Liz – That would explain a lot, he has only gotten worse lately.
 Jim – For some reason the divorce hit him hard.
 It doesn’t make much sense, mom never treated him all that well.
 Liz – She always seemed nice to me.
 Jim – Mom was like 2 different people, she was lovable and sweet around company, but when there was only us… she told him a million times since he was a baby that she hated him and that he was a mistake.
 She meant it too.
 Liz – You’re making this up aren’t you.

They should have been focused on you.” I wasn’t sure they had attacked the horse.
 Maybe it was because I’d been there, in his mind, controlling him.
 “What happened to Rhys and Rider?” “They broke to keep from fighting such a sizeable force alone.
 They circled back to meet us.
 In the disorder, they lost track of the wolves.” “But the wolves weren’t hurt?” “They had been strung up by vine among the trees, but alive.” I winced at the idea.
 “Why?” A wry smile crossed his lips and I couldn’t help but focus on them for a moment.
 “Because the wolves would have fought to the death, and Grand Council does not kill animals with magic.” I remembered my mother.
 “Only elves?” His mocking smile widened.
 “Only elves.” They thought killing an animal with magic was evil, dark, but they were hunting us down.
 To burn us.

“Why do you think this happened to me?
 I mean, we’ve tried to figure out how I can get back, but we don’t even know why it happened.” “I don’t know, Marie.
 I still can’t really believe it happened.
 If you hadn’t been scared half to death, I would have thought you were playing a joke on me.” She smiled a bit.
 “If you’re playing a joke on me, I want to take one of your televisions home with me.”  Returning her attention to the mushroom, she frowned.
 “And that’s another thing—why 84 years in the future?
 Why not five years?
 Or 100 years—at least that’s a round number.
 Why the year 2011?” Her questions made him reflect uncomfortably.
 The fact that he’d read an article about her just days before she’d appeared couldn’t be a coincidence.

He drew his sword and spoke softly.
 “So be it.”
 Elves appeared in the windows of every building that lined the center.
 Full quivers hung from their backs.
 Sixty more elves joined their lone companion on the street and readied their bows.
 The men in the center raised their shields, but they knew the deadly aim of a trained elf.
 They were about to be massacred.
 “Stand firm!” Antonil ordered, raising his own shield.
 “Stand firm.
 Do not break formation!” A shout came from the elven side, and then the hail began.

I felt horrible for my little brother Harry who was ten years old at the time, because they were so close.
 I also felt bad for his aging Father (my Greek grandpa) who was very ill, as this was his only son and his namesake.
 Dino’s funeral could be a book in itself.
 On the day of the funeral, we went from church to viewing to church to graveyard, always with another sermon or eulogy, with unbelievable crying and hysterics.
 I was in the family limo with my mother, my brothers and poor old Grandpa (Dino’s father).
 Before I got in the limousine a man walked up to me and introduced himself as Grandpa’s doctor.
 He handed me a bottle of small white pills and told me they were nitroglycerine tablets and to get one under the old man’s tongue if he seemed to be having a heart attack.
 Great, Grandpa is rambling in Greek and may die on my watch!
 At least Dino is not here to beat me if I fuck this up.
 So in the limo I’m tossing these little white pills in Grandpa’s mouth like candy.

I didn’t know what he had seen there, but he blinked, shaking his head.
 “Let’s keep working.” He stepped a few paces away as he spoke.
 “You’ll need to think clearly and stay calm.
 The best fighters are the best thinkers.” “Fighters?” I asked, confused.
 He shook his head again, as if clearing it.
 There was a long pause as I waited for his answer.
 “I’d like you to practice just for protection.” “I have fire.” He picked up a fallen branch, long and jagged, and snapped the smaller twigs from its side.
 “Yes, but you should learn to think more openly.
 It is an important resource and should be familiar to you.
 You should have years of experience by now.” “Why don’t I?” He stopped.

My mother had killed his family, his entire clan.
 He’d been there in the village in my dreams, in my memories.
 He had saved me.
 His family was there as well.
 The people running and screaming and dying were his clan.
 I knew the cloaks in that vision now, too.
 They were Grand Council.
 The council was circling my mother to stop her.
 She was killing the northern clans.
 I didn’t know why.

My marriage suffered because Lisa defended Brandon vehemently; I completely understood, because I had grown up with a similar scenario: my mother’s unwillingness to see Thomas’s problem.
 My wife and I had many confrontations, and while we both knew he had a problem we disagreed on the severity and the solution.
 Soon, Brandon moved in with his girlfriend, Tiffanie, and she was as strung out as he was.
 When they were together, they looked like two skeletons embracing.
 They had grown fuzzy around their edges; it’s difficult to describe how they clung to each other in a desperate way as if they didn’t know where one ended and the other began.
 It was more than teenage passion driving them to that; it was dependence, an unhealthy co-dependence.
 They couldn’t meet anyone’s eyes; their pinpoint pupils darted around the room when I spoke to them.
 They couldn’t answer simple questions coherently.
 They babbled and told those outrageous stories.
 They were sick.

“Some people should not reproduce,” she said.
 Down came her staff, all her might behind it.
 The end smashed his genitals, eliciting a cry of pain beyond anything her spells could do.
 She continued to strike, punctuating every word with another blow.
 “So, let, me, fix, that, for, you!”
 She stopped when he passed out from the pain.
 She turned his head to the side so he wouldn’t choke on his own blood, a strange gesture of kindness considering what was left of his manhood.
 “Glad to give you something to remember the town by,” she said.
 After a flirtatious flip of her hair, she started down the street.
 Aurelia froze, her blood as cold as when she had sensed the man in black.

He fell to the ground, the arrow sticking straight up at the sky.
 Now the forest was maniac free.
 I killed the others and looked up to find the thrashers dead too, probably courtesy of Seth.
 A few dwarfs were also lying dead in front of Emily.
 I walked back to my body and closed my eyes.
 When I reopened them, I stood, stretching my legs.
 The four of us headed back to the restaurant together, adrenaline still pumping through my veins.
 I told Emily and the boys about the freaky dwarves.
 “Crazy right?” I asked, running a hand through my hair.
 No one said anything and Emily produced a pencil out of her bag.

I cast a spell upon his throat, filling it with ice.
 I watched him die and then I left that disgusting place forever.”
 “You were a worthy apprentice,” Velixar said.
 “Especially to learn such a spell on your own.
 Your master was blind.”
 “He was weakened,” Qurrah said.
 “Even the clumsiest of fighters can slay a sleeping man.”
 “How old were you then?” Velixar asked.
 “Nine,” Qurrah said.
 The man in black shook his head.

Nothing about what had happened to her made sense, but Rick was right.
 If she had to walk out of 1927 into another time, she was fortunate she’d walked into his time.
 The week went by quickly.
 Marie always began the day with a walk in the garden, and Rick always hugged her and dried her tears when she returned.
 When he left for work, she'd exercise and watch movies he'd rented for her and clean the house with the supplies she'd discovered.
 In the evenings they'd eat and talk and watch TV, but he promised to take her to the shore Saturday.
 "The first thing we have to do is buy you a bathing suit," Rick told Marie as they strolled through the mall after dinner Friday evening.
 "Be prepared, OK?
 I think you'll find them a little immodest."
 She tried to prepare herself, but she was shocked by the outfits she was shown.

Because the potential risks far outweigh the possible advantages of continued reliance on this means of achieving national and international security, war has become obsolete as an instrument of policy.
 At the same time, there is no longer an insurmountable political conflict within the UN system to prevent all member countries from agreeing to a total ban on the use of violence against each other.
 It is time for the UN to declare war itself a crime against humanity and to ban from membership any nation that engages in aggression against another.
 Even if this intention cannot immediately be made effective, the adoption of this Peace Imperative would mark a milestone in human affairs.
 There is no rational or practical obstacle to the immediate adoption of this measure.
 As a starting point, it can be demonstrated that with the right perspective, courage and commitment, practical immediate solutions are possible for any and all of the conflicts presently raging.
 Recent failures of international diplomacy do not contradict this assertion, they confirm it.
 War must, and can, be abolished.
 Nuclear Weapons
 The threats to future peace come in many forms and at many levels, but unquestionably the most pernicious and potentially devastating is the peril from nuclear weapons.

Since God hardly needs spiritual growth, let’s define loving God as the willingness to sacrifice when God calls us to.
 And at the very least, he calls us to obey his commandments.
 Meaning we face yet another problem.
 In churches that preach seeking relationship rather than religion, we're told that lacking a relationship with God, we’ll have at best a heck of a time trying to obey.
 And I have seen no reason to doubt that assessment.
 But if the call to relationship implies we should adore, I confess that truth has escaped me until now.
 I mean, we all know it's possible to have a relationship with someone we don't adore.
 But to have a relationship with Jesus and fail to adore him seems all wrong.
 Evil, maybe.
 After all, I adored Eric Curtis.

“If your patience matches your beauty then my brother will soon be dressed in nobles’ finest, sipping wine and commenting on the taxing errors of our dear King of Neldar.”
 Aurelia blushed.
 She smiled at Qurrah.

 It truly is a pleasure to meet you.”
 “And it is a pleasure to meet the elf that my brother is so smitten for.”
 Aurelia giggled at Harruq’s squirming.
 “He’s a loveable puppy dog, but I do not think he is smitten.
 Are you, Harruq?”
 “Um, course not,” the half-orc said.

I drive a lot, across the desert to visit my kids and grandson in Tucson, and all over the West and sometimes farther on vacations and book promotion tours.
 One reason I drive rather than fly is, I come closest to adoring God while on the road.
 Between cities, I plug in my I-pod.
 What goes in comes out.
 If I listen to a love song, these days I’ll probably wish for a loving companion.
 If I turn on a radio talk show, I usually want to argue.
 Those pastimes aren’t good for me.
 So, on long trips in my old Toyota I listen to hymns, gospel music and such.
 As I set off on this trip, half book promotion tour and half vacation, I’m wrestling with Brother Lawrence and the question, why don’t I adore God?
 I plan to drive up the West Coast, San Diego to Seattle, and stop over with Cliff Torrey in Atascadero and Bob Williams in Portland.

 He tried to destroy the Council of Mages, but they destroyed him instead.” Velixar gave a greedy look at Qurrah.
 “He was but a starving boy when I found him.
 I gave him a name and lent him my power.

 Jim – Since it wasn’t something you said…you must have worn your McDonald’s uniform for gang colors again.
 Eugene – It should have worked, people just don’t seem to understand how tough you have to be to work there.
 The heat, the humiliation, the fact that you work for a clown.
 It’s a dangerous job.
 The uniform should inspire fear and respect in all who see it.
 I was even wearing my visor backwards!

I'd been trying to find the vivid dreams again.
 I'd finally stopped thinking about them, finally stopped yearning for them every night, only to have my stupid subconscious somehow mix them up with real life.
 That was really the thing that was the most unnerving.
 I'd only ever unconsciously drawn real places.
 To draw a pretend place was surprisingly unsettling, but I almost couldn't blame whatever part of me had gotten confused.
 The dreams were so clear and sharp they sometimes seemed more real than the rest of my life.
 By the time I finally realized what was keeping me from getting real sleep it was too late to worry about trying to get anymore rest.
 I just stared out my window at the light the previous owners had mounted on a pole.
 It was just close enough to see an amazingly thick cloud of insects swirl around it, captivated by the artificial glow.
 When I walked downstairs I found Mom's camping equipment piled in the living room.

“For hundreds of years my brother and I lived here, and for hundreds of years more we would have remained.
 He is dead now, and for what reason?”
 “Death has no reason,” Qurrah said, his whole body tensing.
 “No,” the elf said, turning around so he could stare at Qurrah eye to eye.
 “But murderers do.”
 Neither moved.
 Neither spoke.
 Qurrah felt his nerves fray, and in his gut a sudden confusion swelled.
 He felt as if he hung over the side of a cliff, and the bones he held were the rope.
 The elf let go of his bow and held his hands out to either side.

Rachel grabbed my arm, disrupting my concentration.
 "Are you okay?
 What's going on?"
 She had a cell phone out, partially hidden by her desk.
 Part of me wondered why I'd never seen her with a phone before.
 Most girls walked around looking like they'd had some experimental surgery that created a two-way graft between their phone, their hand, and their ear.
 It didn't really matter though.
 Cell phone or not, the biggest part of me was already floating away to somewhere safe.
 "I'll call Alec; he'll know what to do."
 She was still whispering, but the words sheared through the darkness, arresting my fall.

They lived in what had once been a large shed.
 The door was still boarded shut, but the window, well…
 For two such as they, windows worked as well as doors.
 They sat diagonally of each other so they had room to stretch their legs.
 Harruq unhooked his belt and placed his swords in a corner, brushing their hilts against his fingertips.
 “I want to learn how to use them,” he said.
 “Think anyone will teach me?”
 Qurrah laughed.
 “You’ll find plenty who’ll teach you how to die by one,” he said.
 “I’m not sure about the other way around.”

 Now I don’t have very little control over Johnny, I wish I did, but I don’t.
 The only thing Johnny’s shaping up holds in common with winning the lottery is that the chances are slim and all I’ll ever be able to do is fantasize about it.
 Jim – If only you did win the lotto, then you could buy a nice tropical island somewhere and send Johnny to it.

 Jeremiah Stoutmire walked through the village of Cornrows, the hair on his neck erect.
 The cool spring breeze was weak compared to the ice that locked his spine.
 He held a torch in one hand and a shortsword in the other.
 At first, he had thought himself foolish waking in a full panic from a nightmare he could not remember.
 Then he saw others about, lit torches in their hands, and he knew his fear was justified.
 A young, fat-nosed farmer saw him awake and approached.

The central element of the programme was the introduction of a new currency, the `superdinar', in parallel to the existing currency, but without demonetizing or confiscating it.
 Inspired by an experiment in the Soviet Union during the 1920s, the value of the new currency was tied to that of the Deutsche Mark and made fully convertible without restriction.
 Based on the country's very limited foreign currency reserves, new issues of the currency were to be utilized primarily to inject real purchasing power into the economy, revive demand and stimulate production, while covering the government's budget deficit during an initial six-month period needed for sufficient recovery.
 In this way the foreign currency and gold reserves were used as a buffer to moderate contraction of the money supply and avoid the shock usually accompanying such efforts.
 Issuing of the old dinar was stopped, but it remained in circulation as legal tender.
 An interest rate of six per cent was established for the superdinar - the first real, positive interest rate in years - to make holding the new currency an attractive alternative to hoarding goods or foreign exchange.
 It had been widely anticipated by foreign experts that this strategy would result in an immediate run on the country's foreign reserves and thereby a collapse of the new currency's foundation.
 Contrary to expectations, the initial months of the programme have yielded spectacular results.
 Inflation fell to zero per cent in the first week after the issue of the new currency and remained below one per cent during the first five months.
 Instead of a massive outflow of foreign currency through conversion of superdinars, people have rushed to cash in their foreign currency, resulting in a 60 per cent increase in the nation's reserves during the first three months.

I am tucked away in a remote parking space at a retail shopping center.
 No one would normally park this far from the grocery store, which anchors an array of businesses, at least not this late at night in this sparsely populated lot.
 I know this place well, as this is where my wife and I buy our groceries.
 It is in an upper class neighborhood serving the wealthy residents who live in their posh homes nearby.
 The front of my truck faces a short decorative fence, which borders a greenbelt area, and I stare across the wetlands that the railing protects.
 As I sit, I think about the circumstances in my life that brought me to this spot.
 I am alert to my surroundings but distracted by my thoughts.
 The fingers on my left hand slowly stroke my bottom lip and then downward across my graying goatee.
 It is eerily quiet but my mind pounds with the noise in my head.
 My attention should be entirely on the task at hand and not the events in my life that lead me here, but my mind hiccoughs.

All around him, the sea of undead swayed and moaned as if they shared their master’s anger.
 “Perhaps it is a mistake,” he said.
 “Or he has done so only to keep himself safe.
 Let me talk to him.
 He will listen to me; he always has.”
 Velixar shook his head and pointed toward Woodhaven in the far distance.
 “Back there he left you, and I must punish him for such…‌Qurrah, look to the sky.”
 Qurrah followed Velixar’s gaze, and there in the distance he saw many white objects faintly illuminated by the stars.
 “About a hundred,” Qurrah said.
 “But what are they?”

Art – Well, it’s a bit of a mouthful, but a bit more accurate than ‘dirty old perverted man’ or whatever.
 I mean ‘dirty old pervert man’ sounds a lot like a super villian’s name or something, and I don’t really think that I could be considered a super villain by any stretch of the concept.
 On top of that there is the ‘old’ part, I’m not really that old, I’m only forty-two years old, which may seem ancient beyond belief to a beautiful young woman such as yourself, but when you get to my level, well, it just kind of is how old you are.
 It doesn’t feel much different than when I was in my twenties or thirties, well I’m in better shape now, which isn’t saying much, I was kind of a nerd back then and didn’t do much exercising…
 Karen – Get on with it.
 Art – Ah yes, where was I?
 Karen – You were eventually going to inform me what you feel I should call you.
 Art – I prefer Art.
 It’s my name.
 Well short for Arthur.

CM: 	Someone called “A Day in the Life” a miniature “Waste Land.”
 BG:  	That’s caca, isn’t it?
 I mean, c’mon.
 Have you read “The Waste Land?”  Jesus.
 You know, I love “Day in the Life.”  Shit.
 It doesn’t get much better than that, pop music-wise.
 “I read the news today oh boy” is just about the finest first line I’ve ever heard.
 I’d kill to have written that one line.
 But, does it compare to “April is the cruelest month?” Or “Turning and turning in the widening gyre?”  Or even, “Something there is that does not love a wall?”  No, of course not.
 And John would tell you the same thing.

They nodded and I was surprised the small gesture also seemed in step.
 A strange whine emanated from one of the dogs as they shifted to sit on their haunches.
 By their size, I might have guessed they were wolves, but I’d never known a wolf to be tamed.
 Their fur matched the robes of their masters, down to the black trim.
 I couldn’t be certain in the light, but I thought there was even some silver showing.
 Surely they would be less frightening in the light of day.
 Ruby broke the tense atmosphere with a curtsey.
 “And Ruby Summit.” I attempted a smile for her, not missing the silent exchange between Steed and Chevelle.
 They were trying to decide what to do with me.
 “Since you’re apparently not ready to retire for the evening, I suppose we will resume your training,” Chevelle said.

Marmeledov tells of a dream in which God sets straight the wise men who object to his accepting Sonia into glory: "Here is why, oh you wise, here is why, oh you of understanding—-her sins which are many are forgiven for she has loved much."
 I jotted the quote on a slip of paper and kept it in my wallet until it disintegrated.
 The only time in my rather lengthy existence I have so treasured an idea.
 Liz wanted more attention from me than I wanted to give.
 But we played fairly well together until, one Sunday evening, I wanted to go to a certain dance, which was held weekly and at which I always danced with other girls in addition to Liz.
 This time, Liz wanted me to myself, at her place.
 Her folks were out of town.
 Maybe the proposition and setup spooked me.
 Anyway, for reasons lost to time, I went to the dance alone, and afterward took Serena Furby for a ride.
 I hadn’t known that Serena and Liz sat next to each other in summer school.

In the silence, an elf walked up beside him, his keen eyes taking in the torches that lit the city.
 “The city is quiet,” the elf said.
 “They await battle.”
 “Let us hope it does not come to that, Dieredon.
 Perhaps they will accept the king’s orders for now.”
 The elf shook his head.
 “You know they will not.”
 Antonil glanced at the elf, who was painted in camouflage and still wore his wicked bow slung across his back.
 He sighed.
 “You’re right.

But I was.
 I was going to do it.
 And if I got caught?
 I could claim ignorance.
 The entire clan thought I was an imbecile in any case.
 Maybe I would just see how close I could get.
 Maybe just to try… And then I was there, standing in front of the Council building and walking in.
 My attempt at stealth was a poor endeavor, but no one ever seemed to pay much attention to me anyway.
 I casually leaned around a doorway to see into the next room, where a small group of villagers stood, blocking my way.
 They spoke in low voices, and as I tried to figure a way past, something seized my attention.

Try creepy, but cool.” Emily rolled her eyes.
 “Boys, I still don’t know how they find this interesting.” She pointed to Jason and Seth, who were continuing to guess random names to describe the arch.
 “I mean, who cares!
 Am I right about them?” “Yes, completely,” I said and fought a laugh.
 “Don’t try to understand or you’ll get lost in the complicated labyrinths that are their brains.” “I think this is the most thinking the two have ever done,” Emily said with a sigh and shook her head, making her pink curls dance.
 “It’s just sad.” I was about to say something else when the dwarf gave a loud cough.
 Jason and Seth fell silent, outlined by the eerie glow of the arch.
 “You must know a few things before you enter,” the dwarf said, pacing back and forth.
 He reminded me of a teacher instructing a class.
 “First of all, once you enter, there is a chance that you won’t be able to leave for a while.” My heart fell at this.

 "Go on up to your room and take a nap."
 "No--let's go back to the living room."
 "Aren't you tired?"
 "A little.

 But I'd rather talk."
 "All right."
 Arm in arm they returned to the living room and sat on the sofa.

Who else did we play with at that time—such a bombastic time—right before the implosion, you know?
 It was all so ripe, so ready to burst.
 What’s that word for a plant that explodes outward, sends its seeds out—dehiscence.
 That was 1968-69.

He clutched tighter, the threads braiding into a giant rope in his mind.
 High above, the skulls quieted, and their fires dimmed.
 When the necromancer noticed Qurrah’s meddling, his mental link pulsed with incredible energy.
 Colors swarmed through his mind, dark purples and reds across a macabre canvas of black.
 He felt his chest tightening, his neck constricting.
 A scrying eye was upon him, now, and he was losing.
 It felt like an arrow pierced his mind, and through it words seeped into his head.

In order to provide employment for every job seeker, the world needs to create approximately one billion new jobs during the next decade.
 This will require a job growth rate of more than 4 per cent per year compared to the less than 3 per cent achieved during the 1980s.
 About 95 per cent of the growth in the world labour force over the next 35 years will take place in developing countries.
 An additional 260 million people will enter the workforce during the 1990s.
 Employment in the East Asian economies is projected to grow by 37 per cent between 1990 and 2000, while the labour force will increase by only 17 per cent, leading to an increasing shortage of labour in the region.
 In contrast, employment growth is projected to lag behind labour force growth in South Asia, Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa.
 Although job growth has once again started in many OECD countries, economic growth alone will not be sufficient to bring down unemployment rates significantly, especially among youth and the long-term unemployed.
 Changes in values, attitudes, structures and policies will be necessary.
 Unless concerted action steps are taken, global unemployment will increase by 130 million during the 1990s.
 Our thesis is that there is a great deal that can be done to prevent this outcome and even reverse the trend, leading to sharply reduced levels of unemployment and progressive eradication of poverty over the next decade.

"Sleep well, sweetheart."
 "Goodnight, Rick."
 She gave him a quick smile before slipping into her room.
 Rick's smile had become a frown by the time he was in his own room.
 He wasn't sure this trip was such a good idea after all.
 Sharing her dream was going to make him fall even more deeply in love with her.
 And when she left, he'd be devastated.
 But remembering the excitement on her face as she'd danced with the actor, he couldn't regret it.
 The next day they went to Universal Studios.
 "This is set up like an amusement park," Rick told her as he bought their tickets.

His Mithril was shining in the sun.
 His breast plate was solid dark Night Bronze.
 The middle of his breastplate had the symbol of the Immortalists, an eagle soaring up into the clouds.
 In his left hand was the regulation one handed long sword of the guard.
 In his right he held a small round shield.
 The shield did not give much coverage against bows and arrows, but was light and great for blocking hand-to-hand attacks.
 Rodregas swung his short swords in slow circular motions and slowly backed up.
 The two slavers behind the guard apparently had been impressed with the violence so far and stayed in the safety behind the guard instead of separating to each side of him.
 One of the slavers was human, the other a small Orqui or maybe a half breed.
 The human held a long sword, the Orqui a mace.

"She wanted you to wear them.
 They were meant to be worn again tonight."
 My head was still spinning as Alec offered me his arm and led me out of the room.
 There was a limo, easily the largest vehicle I'd ever seen, waiting for us outside.
 We piled into it with plenty of room to spare.
 The bar was fully stocked, but Alec shook his head at Rachel when she made as if to reach for a drink.
 Nobody else seemed even the slightest bit interested in the prospect of alcohol.
 Rachel sat back with a pout and then turned and whispered in my ear.
 "Stupid shape shifters.
 None of them can get drunk, so they deprive the rest of us of the best parts of being young and stupid."

 One after another the deft strokes came in, and one after another Antonil batted them away using the methodical style that had helped him rise to his place at the top of the Neldaren army.
 His opponent, a young elf whose swordplay was raw compared to most of his brethren, tried to give him no reprieve.
 The guard captain didn’t falter in the slightest.
 “You sacrifice planning and thought for sheer speed and reflexes,” he said, his breathing steady and practiced.
 He assumed the elf spoke the human tongue, and the sudden killing lunge proved him correct.
 Antonil pulled his head back, the point stopping just shy of drawing blood.
 An upward cut took the blade from the elf’s hand.

What I’m saying, in a song like “Love for Lorelei” or “The Golden Apples of the Song”—new stuff, you haven’t heard it yet-- is that, here are my words, man, here’s my life in words.
 What I’m saying is what I mean.
 If I sing “I love you” over and over, that’s truth, man, that’s where I’m coming from, because I mean it, because I’m singing to Lor, and I love her, there’s no secret to it, there’s no murkiness, no florid touches, it’s just raw, like art should be, raw, simple, full of emotion.
 “I Want to Hold Your Ass While You Move”—I wrote that after a particularly beautiful night of lovemaking.
 I don’t care, you know.
 I don’t care if people think it’s too personal, too open, too—what?—minimal or plain and straightforward.
 I mean, some people don’t like that in their art, they can’t take that.
 It’s like Pop Art, which Lor turned me on to.
 What these guys are saying is, it’s simple, man, art is all around you.
 It’s soup cans, it’s goats, it’s flags.

“Are you trying to kill me?” she asked, “and are you really trying to rescue a Forest Nymph from a tree?” The laughter that followed was pure and open and even he had to laugh with it.
 “So,” he asked, “what are you doing?” “Well, I decided that if this was a greater sigil I should touch it.
 Even though I do not want a greater sigil to consume my magic, this is the One Tree.
 And well, I am a Nymph.
 So I reached out and touched the tree and nothing happened.
 But trees speak to me.
 Speaking to the One Tree was wonderful; the One Tree is here and not here.
 Somehow it can be reached from here I think is the best way to describe it.
 But there is no sigil to be had.
 The tree ‘spoke’ to me as trees do, and it explained about the ‘Blessing of the One Tree,’ that is probably why it was here like the greater sigils.” Imeralda spoke in a conversational tone but also like she was amazed by her own story.

Rising panic over not being able to breathe made me hammer at the iron bar pressing me against her, but she never looked away from whatever had captured her concentration.
 Rachel suddenly appeared off to my right, and she put her finger to her lips, and then sank all ten fingernails into Dominic's arm.
 The sudden absence of the support I'd been unconsciously using to keep weight off of my right foot resulted in tear-jerking pain as the damaged appendage touched down, but I gritted my teeth and managed to keep it down to a hiss.
 Rachel draped my arm over her shoulders, and then dragged me forward a couple of awkward, hopping steps.
 A couple of heartbeats passed before I realized the pool of shadow before us was Jessica.
 She had her eyes closed and was rocking back and forth as Rachel carefully pulled her to us.
 I mirrored Rachel's actions, wrapping my free arm around Jess as I whipped my head back and forth in an effort to figure out what was going on.
 We were pressed up against one corner of the pavilion, with what I assumed was the rest of the pack between us and everyone else.
 For a moment the wall of bodies precluded figuring out what was going on, but then Isaac shifted slightly to the left, and I saw Brandon and Vincent through the gap.
 The pools of black where Vincent's eyes should have been finally made me aware of the prickle of energy arcing back and forth between the two rival groups.

 “She took all who were good out of the abyss and gave their care to Ashhur.
 Left with nothing but thieves and murderers, Karak had no choice but to make it eternal.
 The abyss is dark, Qurrah, and there is fire, but there is also order.”
 “What do you wish of me?” Qurrah asked.
 Velixar’s face softened into a dark smile.
 “To fight the war.
 Celestia may have condemned it to continue forever, but she slumbers now.
 Harnessing enough power, we can defeat the goddess.
 We can bring all of Dezrel under our control and declare victory for Karak.”

He dropped to his knees, grabbed the sword, and rolled forward.
 Steel smacked where he had been.
 Now on his back, Harruq tossed the sword in front of himself, clutching the hilt with both hands.
 The orc smashed his own blade downward, and as they connected, Harruq did not feel fear or the strain of his muscles.
 He felt exhilarated.
 Even though the orc pressed with all his strength, he could not force the kill.
 At last, Harruq forced him back, and in the brief opening he spun his sword around and buried half the blade into the orc’s gut.
 The orc gasped something unintelligible, dropped his other sword, and fell limp.
 Harruq stared at the body, his hands shaking from the excitement and his breath thunderous in his ears.
 A hand touched his shoulder.

Of course, thousands died, but what is a little sacrifice compared to such gains?”
 “They joined your army, didn’t they, necromancer?” Dieredon asked.
 Velixar laughed.
 “You are wise, elf, and you are strong, but you have sheltered arrogance.”
 The man in black stood, pulling the hood back from his face.
 His eyes shone a blinding red.
 His face was a pale skull covered with dead gray skin.
 Maggots crawled through the flesh, feasting.
 Dieredon delayed his attack, stunned by the horrific sight.
 Velixar, however, gave no pause.

 “Who?” Dieredon asked.
 She shrugged.
 “My guess is his brother.
 He sounds like a necromancer.”
 Dieredon nodded.
 “I’ll find him and watch him for a bit.
 If either of them slaughters another child, I will see it and put an end to it.”
 Aurelia pulled a few strands of hair away from her mouth and tucked them behind her ear.

Many refused to meet his eye or acknowledge his question.
 The half-orc’s frustration grew.
 “That’s it,” he muttered to himself.
 “Just one more and I’m going home.
 To the abyss with all this.” An elf approached.
 He had long brown hair, walnut eyes, and an elaborate bow slung on his back.
 The hardened look on his face gave Harruq little hope.
 “Do you know of a woman named Aurelia?” he asked anyway.
 “Aurelia?” the elf asked.
 “Why in all of Dezrel would you be looking for her?”

 I mean, how do we find them?” He wasn’t smiling anymore either.
 “Well, there’s a good chance they’ll be looking for us.” Of course, and they would all come together.
 It was clear we were too strong for one or two, they would need to attack as a group.
 Or pick us off one by one.
 I wondered how large their force was.
 “Frey?” “Steed?” It wasn’t as funny this time.
 “How did you do it?” I raised my brow, unsure what he was asking.
 “The snake,” he clarified.

I clung to Chevelle’s strong back as we rode at full speed.
 The wind and rain cut at my face, my eyes sore, cheeks streaked with tears and ash.
 I woke startled to the sound of laughter.
 It took several minutes to gather my thoughts enough to know where I was.
 In bed… at Ruby’s.
 Ruby, the half-breed.
 I was drenched in sweat.
 My head throbbed.
 Something had happened to me.
 Fairy dust, Steed had said.

Far away, a wolf howled._
 Come to me, _said a voice.
 Qurrah looked to the distance.
 He could see a man cloaked in black standing upon a hill.
 Red eyes burned through the blackness within his hood.
 The feeling of absolute power then was greater than Qurrah had ever felt, greater than even the master of his youth._
 Why should I follow?
 _Qurrah heard himself ask.
 Hands stretched to the heavens, the cloaked man laughed.
 His power surged with the laughter, obliterating Qurrah’s ability to stand._

And it was all true.
 Suddenly, I couldn’t catch my breath.
 “Please, Freya, stay calm,” Ruby pleaded.
 They were circling me, their arms outstretched as if to catch me… or cage me.
 Black spots floated in my vision.
 My head screamed.
 The sound of metal bands snapping echoed through a scraping, screeching noise inside my head.
 I pressed my palms against my temples.
 I didn’t know I was going down until my knees hit the hard rock.
 I held myself there, refusing to give in.

He started rambling something about how I didn’t like him or respect him and I quickly claimed I did.
 I was a lanky fifteen year old, probably about 5’8’, 140 pounds.
 He stepped towards me as I obeyed his wish for me to come to him.
 He hit me so fast I didn’t see it coming, and I flew backwards onto the desktop.
 All four legs of the desk broke beneath the impact of my body.
 I lay there stunned on my back.
 As Dino walked towards me I could see the crowd of guests rushing in behind him.
 He straddled me and I gathered my legs towards my chest with my arms crossed in front of my face to protect myself.
 He looked like a killer standing over me, his eyes big, his teeth gritted and his right fist well above his head poised to pound me again.
 I straightened my right leg out as a kick upward directly into his crotch as hard and fast as I could.

And the music, each note contained all kinds of harmonies, all at once.
 And the instruments sounded like giant bells, big as mountains, far away.” Eric had sat up.
 His eyes bored into mine.
 “Were you scared?
 What’s it feel like there?” “You know when you’re away from home and no matter how great a time you’re having, you’re still a bit uneasy, so when you get home you always feel relieved?
 You unwind, your heart slows.
 Nothing can hurt you now.
 That’s how it felt.” “You’re a lucky guy,” Eric said, in a more wistful tone than I had ever heard him use.

While there was a bunch of fruit trees and berry bushes, most were the descendants of the original orchard and it was hard to find anything that reassembled a straight row.
 The apples trees were in fruit and they all started grabbing a few of each to eat as they went.
 Rodregas was not much of a farmer and did not know what the different types were named, but he liked the small green ones with the yellow splotches; they were sweet with a wonderful tang.
 “You know,” said Doi’van, “Hiding on a ley line definitely makes sense for keeping the Immortalists off our back and these apples are delicious.” Rodregas stared at him as he ate.
 Humans ate around the core, but Doi’van was eating the whole apple as he talked.
 “And I love the feel of all the magic.
 My body was meant to live in a place that has more magic than our world does, but the lines are chaotic.
 It is hard to sleep on a wild line.
 It is going to be hard to stay here for long.” Doi’van’s deep voice had the tone of making a simple observation, not conversation.
 Rodregas nodded; he had been waiting for the comment, but he had thought it would be Imeralda who brought it up.

The metal clashed and I felt the shock vibrate through me even as the peal pulsed in my ears.
 He struck again and I pulled the sword back, twisting to block another shot.
 I straightened and raised it back, surprised at how powerful I felt the moment before releasing my blow.
 I smiled as I swung at him, sure he would stop me but reveling in being attacker instead of victim.
 He wound his blade around mine, a metallic screech filling my ears as he knocked my strike aside before coming back at me.
 We continued, blow after blow, the repetitive clank forming a pattern in my head.
 Chevelle seemed to be enjoying himself as the exercise increased in intensity.
 I found I was as well.
 I’d taken no direct beatings like my other training and I wasn’t getting as tired.
 No magic.

Both agreed the best strategy would be to use his full strength and speed to be quick and as brutal as he could without killing.
 Doi’van suggested body blows were best, as a full strength a punch into the face would likely kill a normal human.
 The boy who faced him was fair haired and smiling, seeming to relish the match.
 His stance was similar to Rodregas’ own.
 Rodregas went slowly but steadily, keeping his guard up.
 The boy kept his hands up.
 When Rodregas went in low he took the blows to his body and went for Rodregas’ face.
 Against another opponent it was the right move.
 Unfortunately for the boy, his blow seemed to come at Rodregas slowly.
 Rodregas easily dodged as he landed a strong blow to his opponent’s chest.

What I didn’t know was that Crafty was already scheming against me, working on getting the rights to the Black Lung stuff reverted entirely to him, since I was non campo mentis.
 That’s what his lawyer said.
 CM:  	But, for the record here, how did you decide to go to L.A.?
 BG:  	One day, it was, oh about a month after the hospital.
 I’d been at home just sitting there, you know, letting my mind rot.
 Lorelei was doing a lot of painting and she left me to myself as much as I needed it.
 But, I was doing nothing.
 I was mindless.

Of course, if it was a slave caravan then they would simply sit and watch, as it would be suicide to do anything against a full patrol.
 Rodregas heard a rustle in the brush and glanced over to make sure it was just a squirrel or the like.
 He started to jump up as a humanoid shape appeared out of the trees, until he saw that it was just Imeralda.
 She seemed to be paying less attention now to stealth as she was to speed.
 From Imeralda’s expression Rodregas knew it was something more dangerous than a trade caravan coming down the road.
 Imeralda squatted down next to them and whispered, “A slave caravan is coming; it’s small but they have a score of guards.
 We need to back up before they get here.” “We have good cover here,” he whispered back, “let’s check them out as they pass.
 They are probably going to stop at Stallion’s Perch.” After much debate between the three of them Stallion’s Perch was their destination, a small keep that was known to breed Dire horses for the Immortal Guard.
 “We can’t,” responded Imeralda with a whisper.
 “They are traveling with a patrol of Immortal guards.

As it was, I only got a few hurried looks before being rushed along with the rest of the students.
 Seeing all of my classmates looking utterly bored as they allowed themselves to be herded through the most amazing building I'd ever seen brought me back to my original train of thought.
 I hadn't actually spent every waking moment thinking about Les Misérables.
 A fair number of those seconds had been spent with Brandon.
 He'd already been picking me up from school every morning and dropping me off most days.
 We now spent every lunch together, and he'd started lingering when he dropped me off.
 It was still only on the days when Mom wasn't home, and I hadn't quite mustered the guts to invite him in, but it'd still been really nice.
 Of course it'd been the logical kind of thing to have start happening after someone asked you to the Ashure Day Dance.
 It was still so amazing someone like Brandon had asked me to go to a dance that half the time I forgot all about it.
 The other half of the time I had a hard time believing it'd really happened.

He wanted to pull Imeralda down into the bed and celebrate being alive.
 His body was probably too weak to do more than cuddle, but Imeralda seemed to be acting very friendly with the healer.
 Rodregas was not sure if something had changed between them while he was healing.
 The possibility that he had lost what they had just started to explore together made Rodregas’ heart heavy.
 “So, I have been wanting to ask you a question,” said Jordaan.
 “Are the two of you related?
 That is, you and Doi’van?” Rodregas was caught off guard at the ridiculous question.
 “Not to mention the obvious,” Rodregas said, “but Doi’van is an Orqui Hellborn from across the Sea and I am…” Rodregas paused in confusion, what exactly was he now?
 He reached for the closest comparison and said, “I have some Celestial blood, but I am human.” “Oh,” Jordaan said, “well that is strange, you do know that you are also part Hellborn, right?
 Hellborns are very rare in this part of the world and your bodies feel so similar that I thought you might be related through a… well a distant relation.” His heart stopped at his words and he asked in a rush, “You are saying I am Hellborn?

And yes, he is probably one of the only men here that actually deserves knighthood.” Rodregas nodded and said, “What about Nordien?” “Nordien is the polar opposite to Geriodon; smooth and friendly… and tried to have sex with me within our first conversation, which was also the only decent thing he said during our conversation.
 He seems to really dislike Geriodon and Karun.
 He comes from a strong blood line and rich family and feels he should already be a knight and not be forced to be in the tournament.” “So, why is Nordien in the tournament and not knighted?” Rodregas asked.
 “From what I can gather, Nordien is very friendly with the Immortalists, including the Ambassador Van’dret, and most people believe that he only wants to be knighted so that he can then leave the knighthood and join the Immortal Guard.” Rodregas nodded.
 That was not too surprising; since such ex-knights are usually made officers.
 Greater sigils were much more rare in the Guard than the knighthood, not to mention the officers of the Immortal Guard lived in much nicer style than the knighthood.
 “The Knight Commander might not be willing to stand up to the Immortalists, but he would be more than willing to skip over giving knighthood to someone who was planning to leave anyhow,” said Rodregas.
 They had made it to the stables and Doi’van started to put the saddle and tack onto Doom Hoof, the horse that Doi’van had been riding.
 The horse was slow, but big and strong and was the best horse for this kind of combat.
 “So finally, Karun,” said Imeralda, “Not too much is known about her; she was an orphan and clearly of the blood and strong.

The circle blazed with an intense heat that blasted his face and the magnificent creature inside blazed with blue creation fire.
 It was a sudden and violent and primal process.
 The lion started to stand up and then simply fell apart into blazing blue energy.
 That energy surged out of the circle and swirled around inside the larger outer circle.
 Every hair on Rodregas’ body stood at attention.
 Then the blue flaming energy was sucked into the pale green circle.
 There the prisoner, now empty of his own essence, stood still.
 As the blue fire was sucked into his body, the corporal body suddenly seemed more solid than before.
 Once more Ravenhurr yelled out in his melodious voice the trigger words for the next part of the ritual, “Mana faria podia ricoria.” It was now or never for Rodregas to strike.
 Rodregas raised his arm up and threw his club forward with all his strength.

The really attractive people got drawn into the popular circles, less cool people were offered a place with the punks, the nerds, or at least with the drug users, who didn't care as much what you looked or acted like as long as you were hooked on something illegal.
 I knew I had serious problems, but I didn't think they were obvious to everyone that looked at me.
 English was next, and odds were it would be a nearly exact repeat of Biology, possibly minus the awkward introduction.
 The thin, distinguished looking teacher absently accepted my proffered form, starting a little when I didn't leave.
 "Right then, I suppose you need a signature?"
 The accent was so British I half-wanted to ask him how he ended up in Sanctuary.
 I nodded, scanning his desk while I waited.
 Whethers, Mr. Whethers.
 "Right then, I believe there is a vacancy next to Ms. Samuels in the back."
 People were still trickling into the room, so at least I was spared the full gantlet, but the few gazes I met were still unfriendly until I reached the last table.

There was no bond of Ja'tell, and consequently we have no obligation to return her to him."
 Jasmin opened her mouth to say something else, but a tiny brunette, probably Jessica, interrupted her.
 "Alec, we have to do this.
 None of us are stupid; we know what's going to happen.
 You killed two members of his pack."
 There was steel in Alec's voice that I'd never heard before.
 "Still unacceptable.
 You've all aired your opinions; you can retire to your beds now."
 James looked up from where he'd been slouching against the wall, and I suddenly realized that he wasn't shaking from cold.
 He was so furious it looked like he was only seconds away from exploding.

Everyone who swaps classes is going to be doing double homework for the duration.
 Assignments for their old class, which they presumably still want to get credit for, and assignments for the new class so as not to make any more waves than necessary with their temporary teacher.
 It only makes sense to place that burden on the ones who can most easily deal with it."
 That last part had been said in a near whisper, due to the fact that we were right outside Mrs. Sorenson's class.
 Everything he was saying made sense, but didn't resolve the real reason I was so worried.
 "I can help.
 I could switch at least one class and still keep up."
 Alec shook his head.
 "Adriana, you're struggling in two classes already.
 How do you propose to handle yet another set of homework?"

I heard rustling in the trees and dozens of creatures came thundering out.
 I noticed Thrashers, Frost Beasts, swamp trolls and many others I have never seen.
 They lumbered towards us, teeth flashing in the moon light.
 Seth whirled around on the dwarf.
 “You set us up!” he hissed, sword drawn.
 “This was all a trap!” The dwarf's eyes widened in alarm, “I swear, sir, that I knew nothing of this!
 I warned you that you must be prepared for anything.” “Seth,” I said slowly, placing a hand on his shoulder, “Don't attack him, we need him to help us get through Igneeria.” I felt his shoulder muscle tense under my fingers but he lowered his blade.
 He didn't sheath it though, because he would need it in the fight.
 He glowered at the dwarf, “Don't think that I trust you, dwarf,” he said angrily.
 “You're only alive because Jazell makes a good point.

I felt my ears going red.
 I wanted nothing more than to sink down into my seat and try to ignore them, but once guys got started on something like that, they never stopped.
 Some of the people around me were starting to evidence signs of annoyance, but that just spurred the hecklers on to greater heights.
 I was so worried they were going to ruin everyone's experience, that I turned around and shot them a dirty look.
 "Oh, sweetie, don't you worry, we've been aching to get our hands on you all night.
 We're saving plenty of loving for you later.
 Meet us out back after this crap is over and we'll give you a real show."
 My mouth dropped open in shock.
 Nothing was going to get them to shut up now, not when they had such a perfect target.
 Sitting there staring at them was about the worst of all the choices open to me, but I was too shocked to pull my eyes away.

I hated this, if I was aware of it—I really don’t remember.
 Keep in mind, all I wanted to do was play my guitar and write songs.
 And I was writing at an astonishing clip and artists were picking up on it, and, well, the money started coming in.
 See, in a way, I was fortunate.
 I never had to sack groceries at Piggly Wiggly or teach school, or cut lawns.
 Writing songs, I learned early, brought in the bucks.
 And a lot of the talent coming out of Nashville, well, a lot of those guys were singing my stuff.
 See, at that time, everyone wanted to play and sing, but not everyone could write.
 So I wrote.
 And, even if we never performed any of it, which we didn’t, they were my songs, and they were popping up on the radio.

Of course I'd go see how big of a discount the school had gotten the tickets at, but it was extremely unlikely my tiny check would end up being enough.
 It took me a moment to realize Mr. Gossil hadn't ended his announcement.
 "...those wishing to be entered into the drawing should stop by the office between today and noon tomorrow."
 In the face of the near-universal apathy expressed by the rest of the student body, it took my mind several seconds to process exactly what had been said.
 I grabbed Brandon's arm and shook it to get his attention.
 "Did he just say they were drawing for free tickets?"
 Brandon looked slightly amused.
 Cassie, who I'd just interrupted, looked very much not amused.
 "I think so.
 I wasn't paying very close attention, but I think he did."

This time Tom’s paralyzed body was thrown through the window and he tumbled down the highway to his death.
 Brandon was inconsolable.
 His best friend was dead.
 Brandon blamed himself for not being there to take care of Tom.
 One of Brandon’s confessions during rehab was that almost all of his friends decided to get as high as they could to attend Tom’s funeral.
 It was the beginning of his excessive drug abuse.
 Chapter 24: Let The Healing Begin As Brandon approached his fifth month as a student at Narconon, he called us and told us he was nearing graduation from the program.
 He also told us he had applied for an internship at the facility and that he wanted to become a drug counselor.
 Brandon told us he wanted to give back and stay on to help others and told us how much better equipped he felt to deal with the world which surrounds us all, but silently haunts a select few.
 The counselors at Narconon had such a profound impact on him that he wanted to have the same impact on others.

The mid-1980s was a time when global military spending reached an all-time high of $1.2 trillion.
 Economic growth had slowed or stalled in much of the developing world, prompting some to term the 1980s the 'lost decade' for development.
 While there was little agreement on what steps were needed to reverse the arms race and provide a stable basis for world peace, a consensus was emerging that something must be done to address the urgent problems of hunger, famine and endemic poverty that continued to plague much of the developing world and constituted a gnawing source of instability that refused to be contained by national boundaries.
 The unconscionable loss of lives due to hunger in an age of plenty generated growing concern over the issues of food and famine.
 Starvation forced millions of people, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, to flee their homes in despair.
 It undermined social stability, fuelled violence and in some cases led to war between neighbours and fellow-countrymen.
 The effort to glean more food from desiccated earth further ravaged the environment and aggravated shortages.
 To this was added the galling sight of hunger amidst plenty, when adequate food production was not matched by sufficient job opportunities to provide incomes to all who needed to buy food because they could not grow their own.
 These concerns motivated and were symbolized by the institution of the World Food Prize in 1987.
 It was in this context that, on World Food Day in October 1988, a small group met in Washington DC and proposed the launching of a new initiative to utilize the growing consensus over food to press for more rapid and substantial progress on peace, disarmament and development.

People in orange vests directed traffic.
 In the parking lot, vendors sold oranges, onions, tapes and CDs in Spanish.
 I didn't see any Mother Teresa dolls, but I was half asleep.
 At 6:30 the church was crowded, standing room only.
 I found a place against the west wall near the front section, where the seats were reserved for MC sisters in their white saris.
 They are mostly small brown women with eyes so bright, at first glance they could pass for children.
 Up front, across from me was a small choir accompanied by a guitar and electric keyboard.
 They sang folk style hymns like “Change my heart oh God, make it ever new, change my heart oh God, make me be like you.” I leaned against the wall observing the congregation, vaguely aware that my heart sorely needed to change, since that morning my pastime was criticism.
 I grumbled inaudibly at the people who crowded, trying to position themselves for a clear view of Mother Teresa's approach.
 I disdained the TV camera bearers who nudged the rest of us aside as if the front row was their birthright.

That was big for him—he has that voice, you know, like he’s sitting next to you, and it perfectly fit the song.
 God bless him—no slouch at writing songs himself, he really took me under his wing, sort of.
 Not much has been made of that connection, but John, early on, taught me the logistics of writing for money, of getting my stuff with one of the music publishers.
 A lot of artists did this, you know, kind of like what Dylan was doing with The Basement Tapes, except that took on a whole life of its own, because it was Bob.
 So, I did some demos, at Ardent with Jim’s help, and others, I just wrote, you know, just committed them to paper and John helped me get them disseminated.
 It worked well then to do that.
 I don’t know if it still does.
 Probably, though I don’t do that anymore.
 I’m writing, obviously, for myself more these days.
 So, money was coming in, we were playing regionally.

They won’t get away with this!
 Liz – Bwa ha ha ha!
 Jim & Johnny – What was that?
 Liz – That was an evil sounding laugh, I learned it from Gene.
 Jim – But why did you do it?
 Liz – It just seemed to fit into the whole mood of the conversation.
 Jim – BAH!
 You people won’t open your eyes until people in Palm Beach are drinking beer watching hockey and saying Eh.
 Will you?
 The whole world is full of blind fools who laugh at anyone who can see the truth and dare to talk about what they see.

I pretended I’d been alert.
 “Yeah?” I hadn’t fooled her.
 “Doing okay?” “Uh-huh.” I decided to take the opportunity; I had a dozen questions since reading the diary.
 “Hey, Ruby, are there any castles around here?” The caravan stopped as everyone turned to stare at me.
 I had no idea what I’d said wrong.
 I must have given away the fact that I had no clue where I was.
 It wasn’t my fault.
 I’d never left the village.
 I didn’t know anything about anything.
 She glanced to the watching eyes and again to me.

I really appreciate you making Cassie back down yesterday.
 Nobody else has ever stood up for me like that.
 At least not people that I didn't already know."
 Based on what I'd seen less than thirty hours ago, it didn't look like her friends stood up for her either.
 "No worries, it just seemed like the thing to do at the time.
 Why did she want to hurt you anyways?"
 Rachel looked down, but somehow it wasn't a gesture that conveyed guilt.
 "It's complicated."
 I'd spent too much time with emotions and thoughts floating around in my own head that I didn't want examined too closely.
 I wasn't about to pry if there was something she didn't want to tell me.

Water flowed beneath, smoothing the stones at the base.
 They were so worn, it must have been in place for centuries.
 The leather soles of my shoes skimmed over ancient stone, the bridge curving gently before flattening out into a worn dirt path on the other side.
 It was more traveled than I would have liked, so I swung wide, through the trees instead.
 The wind shifted and the scent of roasting meat assaulted me, dragging my attention, my feet, its way.
 Despite my concerns about other elves, my stomach tightened, my mouth watering as I followed it through the trees.
 They broke into a small clearing, and there in the center stood a cloaked figure, kneeling down as he turned a meat-covered spit.
 Pressed tight behind an oak tree, I shuffled sideways to get a better view.
 I was sure it was an elf, male, from his size.
 The smell of real food was consuming, and I was watching the cooked meat roll over the flame as I moved again.

Alec flinched slightly, and then looked at the grotto.
 "I suppose I'd better clean this up or Donovan is going to be very unhappy with me."
 "Who's Don...." I felt my mouth drop as I finally recognized my surroundings.
 "I've been here before.
 In my dream.
 Then I drew it, which I didn't understand because I only ever draw real places, and this was imaginary.
 Only it wasn't, but there wasn't any way for me to know..." I turned around, expecting to have to field a barrage of questions, but Alec was calmly watching me.
 "Isn't that odd?
 Doesn't that make you want to know what's going on?"
 He was debating whether or not to lie to me.

She had a cell phone out, partially hidden by her desk.
 Part of me wondered why I'd never seen her with a phone before.
 Most girls walked around looking like they'd had some experimental surgery that created a two-way graft between their phone, their hand, and their ear.
 It didn't really matter though.
 Cell phone or not, the biggest part of me was already floating away to somewhere safe.
 "I'll call Alec; he'll know what to do."
 She was still whispering, but the words sheared through the darkness, arresting my fall.
 I didn't want him here, didn't want to give him another reason to despise me.
 What if Jasmin came with him?
 The thought of lying helpless with her in the same room sent shivers of cold sliding down me.

She held his hand in both of hers, playing with his fingers.
 "And-and it feels as good as--as good as kissing?"
 "Better.
 Much, much better."
 She grew warm imagining a pleasure greater than what he'd made her feel a few minutes ago.
 "I wish--"  She stopped, swallowing and closing her eyes.
 "You wish what?"
 When she didn't respond, he tilted her chin up, making her look into his eyes.
 "Stay here, Marie.
 Marry me.

"There isn't anything to worry about now.
 Go ahead and catch your breath."
 As pleasant as it was to be in his arms again, I was starting to worry he'd get tired of it.
 I pushed him away as soon as I was reasonably confident my knees would support me.
 "What's going on?
 Why are they so scared of Brandon?"
 Alec shook his head.
 "This isn't the time; we need to get you back home to your mom.
 It would be most unfortunate if she were to arrive and find you gone."
 My mind was still a little fuzzy, but it was working well enough for me to know he was wrong.

 I mean it made a splash, but briefly.
 And we were asked to play everywhere.
 Suddenly, like we woke up with extra cachet.
 We did the John’s Shell, I don’t know how many times.

The way she said their names implied they were a couple.
 Even if they weren't, she was probably right about not getting my hopes up.
 Especially considering the way Alec had looked at me there at the end.
 Despite my best efforts the question still slipped out.
 "They're together then?"
 Britney smirked.
 "You really are masochistic, aren't you?
 That's the rumor.
 Nobody really seems to know, at least nobody who's talking, but they're almost always together.
 You really shouldn't go there; he's brutal when it comes to breaking girls' hearts."

Eugene – No, I didn’t call their mom’s anything, cut it out damnit, I didn’t do anything to make them angry.
 (gets up and paces a bit, rubbing his hands through his hair, or some other sort of nervous/annoyed action)
 Jim – Since it wasn’t something you said…you must have worn your McDonald’s uniform for gang colors again.
 Eugene – It should have worked, people just don’t seem to understand how tough you have to be to work there.
 The heat, the humiliation, the fact that you work for a clown.
 It’s a dangerous job.
 The uniform should inspire fear and respect in all who see it.
 I was even wearing my visor backwards!
 Jim – (laughs) you only worked at McDonald’s for 3 weeks before you quit.
 Eugene – That’s longer than you lasted janitor-boy, you only made it for like 30 minutes before you quit.

 Greg: that’s a shame, what do you do?
 Cindy: I’m a professional rodeo clown.

Holy tamale.
 I stared at the cracked pieces of my arrow and my flare of determination went out with a poof.
 Great, now what do I do?
 That was a fail, I scolded myself.
 A FAIL!
 “Nice try,” Seth whispered and I think he really meant it.
 Or maybe he was teasing me.
 It’s hard to tell in these situations.
 Seth brandished his sword.
 “My turn.” “Really, warrior?” Kojas said and laughed.

“Only when you’re shopping for cars.
 But in Mexico and a lot of other countries, it’s the custom.” “Thank you,” she said as he fastened the bracelet on her wrist.
 "Can I try negotiating for something?"
 "Sure.
 What would you like to buy?"
 They wandered around, and what caught her eye was not all the silver, gold, turquoise, and leather that the natives thought an American tourist would want but the colorful things like serapes and bajas--Mexican blankets and pullover jackets.
 She found a pink and turquoise baja that she fell in love with.
 The price was ten dollars, and Marie talked the owner down to six dollars.
 "I did it!"
 she exclaimed, taking her baja from the bag.

She cocked her head slightly to the side and looked at me with incredibly large blue eyes that seemed older than they had a few seconds before.
 "It really bothers you that everyone knows?"
 I shrugged uncomfortably.
 "I guess maybe it shouldn't, but it does.
 Nobody likes to be ridiculed, but it's even more than that.
 The attacks started up a couple of months ago.
 They...remind me of a really terrible thing that happened, so when people make a big deal out of them it's like it's all happening again."
 Rachel nodded slowly, her wonderfully expressive face full of sympathy.
 "I'm sorry to have pried like that.
 If I'd known it would make you feel bad, I wouldn't have asked."

Why don’t you believe me that you wouldn’t be interested?
 Johnny – Give it up, he’s right it’s boring and stupid.
 I’m surprised that Jim even bothered to write the crap down.
 Jim – What the hell?
 You little shit!
 How many times have I told you to keep away from my things?
 Goddamn little bastard.
 If I ever catch you in my room again, you’ll wish you’d hanged yourself a long time ago.
 Speaking of which, why don’t you go kill yourself now, it would make the world a better place.
 Johnny -  Fuck you, I’ll do whatever I want.

They were small but were growing fast as we neared them.
 I could feel the dragon’s muscles pump underneath my legs.
 Small gusts of air rolled off the dragon’s wings that blew Emily’s hair in her face.
 I smiled as she raked the pink strands out of her mouth.
 We dipped down and I felt the “stomach-in-your-chest” feeling you usually get from rollercoasters.
 I closed my eyes and tried to ignore it but I couldn’t.
 I hated this feeling just as much as I hated puking, and the chills that liked to run up my spine at random times.
 Then all of a sudden, the dragon stopped.
 My eyes opened in horror as I saw the small trickle of blood fall from a hole in the right wing.
 Then we started to fall.

I held my hand up to stop Emily, waiting until Jason and Seth were grabbing the airplane out of a box and lowered my hand.
 “Revenge!” I yelled, and ran out from behind the trees, with Emily following.
 The looks on their faces were priceless.
 They spun around just in time as Emily launched a balloon right at Jason’s face.
 I aimed at Seth, who I soaked in minutes.
 Their faces looked like they had seen a dinosaur come back to life.
 Jason scrambled away from Emily but she nailed him so many times it didn’t matter, he was already soaking wet.
 The last of my water leaked out the back of the gun and we just stood there.
 Jason smiled but you could see he was hiding the anger in his face.
 Seth was emotionless; he didn’t give any sign on what he was feeling.

By the time I realized I was in trouble, papers were flying off my desk and the floor was racing up to meet me.
 Rather than swimming around in blackness like I normally did when collapsed, this time there was just nothing.
 One second I was falling, the next I was opening my eyes and looking up at Alec.
 "Stand back, everyone, and let me through!"
 It took a few seconds to realize the sub was the one yelling.
 Nobody seemed very interested in making room for him.
 The reason it took so long for my brain to start working again was that I couldn't seem to think about anything other than Alec.
 He was looking down at me with an expression I'd never seen on his face before.
 I still couldn't read it, but it was new and somehow seemed like it belonged there more than his normal impenetrable mask.
 "What's going on?

She knew that she wouldn't be able to keep quiet about him even if she wanted to.
 Rick joined her in the kitchen.
 "How about this one?"
 He was wearing a plain blue t-shirt.
 "Yeah."
 She leaned close, inhaling.
 Then she raised her face to nuzzle his neck.
 "You put on fresh cologne."
 "I wanted to be sure I had on enough for the t-shirt to absorb it."
 She kissed his neck.

I tried not to let my voice get too sing-song, but I felt a completely irrational thrill as he quietly crossed over to my side of the room.
 "That's actually one of the benefits of my condition.
 I don't actually need normal amounts of sleep.
 An hour or two per night is usually more than enough."
 Having him so close to me was somehow both exhilarating and soothing at the same time.
 I could feel the tense, knotty parts of me start to relax for the first time since Simon and Nathanial tried to kill me.
 As exhaustion started to finally eat through all of the nervous energy that'd been fueling me, it was all I could do to follow what Alec was saying.
 Still, I wasn't ready to go to sleep.
 It felt like he'd disappear if I closed my eyes.
 "So you don't need to sleep.

We both stopped shivering as we stared at the sky.
 “Seth, I’m scared,” I whispered.
 “What happens if something goes wrong?” “Nothing will go wrong,” he said fiercely.
 “I won’t let it happen.” I closed my eyes.
 “I keep seeing what happened that night.” “It’ll go away,” he said.
 There was a long silence.
 “This is too awkward and I don’t like the silence.
 It’s not normal for us.” I laughed.
 “Someone make a joke quick!” “Okay,” he said.
 “This feels like those weird movies where the boy puts his arm around the girl and then something comes out of nowhere and eats them both.” I laughed so hard I gagged.

No, blood.
 My nose was bleeding.
 It took a moment to get my bearings.
 My bed sheets were a tangle and my clothes were disheveled.
 It must have been a dream.
 I had fallen asleep looking at my mother’s pendant, trying to remember her, and somehow combined it with the disaster I had read of the northern clans.
 It was only a dream.
 Shaken, I sat up, struggling to collect myself.
 I reached up to remove the pendant from the hook and squeezed it tight in my fist.
 It felt good, like a connection, and I slid the leather chain over my head, pulling the pendant down to rest on my chest.

He had to help him.
 Qurrah took out his last healing potion, popped the cork, and then held it before him.
 Blood was beginning to fill his throat once more.
 His stolen energy was quickly fading.
 He had no time to waste.
 He tilted his head as high as the arrow in his neck allowed, positioned the mouth of the vial against his lower lip, and then closed his hand around the arrow shaft.
 One last hissing breath.
 One tremble of his fingers.
 He yanked the arrow out.
 Sheer reflex kept him alive.

 The streets were all the same to him, so down them all he wandered.
 The image of Aurelia and Harruq danced in his mind, and conflicting feelings rippled through his chest.
 “She seems a kind enough elf,” Qurrah said, talking to himself since he had no company.
 “Beautiful as well.
 Of course Harruq would be attracted to her.
 We have elven blood in our veins, do we not?”
 The words felt hollow against the constant ache in his heart.
 Hard as he tried, he could not place it.

When a smaller patrol turned a corner and vanished, he opened the door, winked at the bloody corpse near the window, and then slipped into the night.
 The scent of mourning floated throughout the town, and he paused to enjoy the bittersweet strands of death that tugged on his heart.
 So many souls lost in battle, and even in the quiet aftermath, it was intoxicating.
 “No sleep tonight,” he said, turning back to the building that had been his shelter.
 Fire swarmed around his fingers.
 Like streams of water, it flowed from his hands, splashing across the roof and setting it ablaze.
 Finished, he ran for an alley to hide as the fire gained the attention of the many patrols.
 He heard footsteps and shouts further down the road so he ducked left, running in between homes as all around the shouts grew louder.
 The houses ended, and like a fleeing thief he burst out into the streets only to slam into a drunken man holding a small bottle.
 The two rolled, a tangle of legs and arms.

Back on the road my thoughts pick up where they left off in San Luis Obispo, and I wonder if Brother Lawrence perceived his constant companion as the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit.
 Maybe my problem with adoring God is my habit of looking at, or for, God the Father, who in my vocabulary is easy to respect, admire, stand in awe of, or even worship, but is hard for me to adore.
 God, to me, looks more like a vapor.
 And his whispering voice either sounds too much like my own to be surely authentic, or else it’s so soft, I’m not often sure I heard right.
 The Jesus I used to picture looked like a young Max Von Sydow in The Greatest Story Ever Told, and his expressions appeared more posed or acted than honestly human.
 But now he's beginning to look more like Eric.
 Eric possessed by Jesus, I can adore.
 I still see him.
 I can watch the lines of his face change as I tell him about my fears or longings.
 I can hear him speak thoughtful words.

However I doubt that voodoo curses would solve our problems anyhow.
 Liz – Red food coloring would have been a little better, but not much.
 Jim – You could have at least used Tabasco sauce or something, we always have that.
 Johnny – I didn’t think it would matter what I put in if I didn’t have the Dodo blood.
 Liz – Good point.
 Jim – Guess we can discount using dark magic or voodoo to solve the problem of Gene’s father.
 Johnny – What do you suggest then?
 Jim – I dunno, just wait I guess.
 Johnny – And then what?
 Jim – And hope that he spontaneously combusts.

Britney, you're headed towards a failing grade, and while you might not care, your father most certainly does.
 Make my class a priority, or I'll stop in for a checkup and let slip just how poorly you're doing to dear old Dad, and then you'll find yourself riding the bus to school."
 It was a vicious threat, but one almost guaranteed to have an effect.
 Britney most definitely didn't want to be stuck riding the bus with all of the junior high kids and other assorted 'losers'.
 Her mouth opened and closed several times and then she nodded and fled the classroom.
 When I finally caught up with her she'd recovered enough to complain, but there was a breathless nature to her voice that told me she wouldn't be skipping the math lab for a little while.
 I made non-committal noises as we waited in line, all the while scanning the cafeteria for two faces.
 Actually, scanning wasn't the right word for it.
 I just kind of looked that way and instantly found my eyes drawn to Brandon.
 He was surrounded by people, mostly female, all attractive.

“I get restless stuck in here,” he said.
 He dropped his weapons in the corner, shed much of his leather armor, and then released a loud groan as he settled down.
 “Harruq, I must ask a favor of you,” Qurrah said.
 He sat next to his brother.
 “Sure thing,” Harruq said.
 “What you need?”
 Qurrah fiddled with the bones in his pouch.
 “There is someone I need you to meet.”
 Harruq raised an eyebrow.
 “The person you’ve been sneaking off to each night?” he asked.

Sure enough, they met while Kesey was writing that novel, two years before it came out.
 And no doubt he had read Kerouac's novels featuring Cassady, a.k.a.
 Dean Moriarty et al.
 In Sometimes a Great Notion, Joe Ben used to be, as a teen, so handsome and so enthralled by girls, he never could have stayed true to any one of them.
 But a motorcycle crash disfigured his perfect face.
 Still, his girlfriend sticks by him.
 She becomes his wife and the mother of his kids.
 And Joe Ben comes to believe that God had allowed that tragedy to save him from the fate of his father, who died a lonely, sex-obsessed drunk.
 Joe Ben is the book’s endearing and admirable character, a humble Christian of supreme courage.
 A vision, I believe, of what Cassady could have become had he overcome his demons.

The guard captain looked around, seeing his entire army protected.
 “Sergan!” he cried.
 “Yes my lord?” the old man asked.
 “Do we have any mages with us?” Antonil asked.
 Sergan shook his head, flinching as an arrow aimed straight for his eye bounced away, its shaft broken.
 The guard captain nodded, raised high his sword, and then turned to his army.
 “Stay calm, and do not move from where you stand!” he shouted.
 The men quieted and listened to their commander.
 “I do not know what blessing we have received, but when it ends…”
 His voice drifted off.

The coiled leather vibrated, hungering for blood.
 “Do not lie to me.
 I have watched you two slaughter my brethren.
 I have seen much of your handiwork.” The elf glared at him, ugly hatred skewing his handsome features.
 “By now your brother is dead.
 Three of my best warriors await him around that corner.
 I thought it appropriate you knew this before I took your life.”
 “Do not talk to me of what is appropriate,” Qurrah said.

I shrugged it off and went back to reading.
 Father has been gone for weeks.
 Rumor is he’s searching for a new mate.
 Someone unique, someone powerful, I’m sure.
 I can’t stand it anymore.
 He thinks I’ll sit here and exhaust myself practicing while he’s out running around.
 All the servants are gossiping and I know nothing.
 I have had it.
 Mother’s room remains sealed, but I was able to obtain some of her things from Father’s study.
 I am only to use them under Rune’s supervision, so I took the books out and returned to my room with them in secret last night.

Its skin and mane were sparkling white.
 Dieredon bowed one last time and then leapt into the air, using the ledge of a window to swing himself onto the roof.
 He mounted his horse, patted her side, and then took off into the night.
 “Damn it all!” Antonil shouted, slamming his mailed fist into the wall.
 Still shaking his head, he stormed back to the gate, muttering curses.
 “What was that all about?” Harruq asked.
 “King Vaelor asked for aid and the elves declined,” Qurrah answered, chuckling.
 “The King’s pride will not take too kindly to that.”
 “He and his pride can suck a rotten egg,” Harruq said.
 “Hurry or we’ll miss the battle.”

Even now, my vision is more like yours when I'm in this form.
 I still see incredibly well, and there's just the slightest hint of light from living things, but nothing like what you saw in the dreams."
 "So you work from memory mostly then?
 That and trying to make what you see when you're in human form even more drab than what you really see?"
 "That about sums it up, although I didn't really expect you to pick up on that last part so quickly.
 You're remarkably perceptive."
 I felt my face heat at the compliment.
 I quickly looked for something worthy of a chuckle to change the subject.
 "So what does a seventeen-year-old shape shifter spend his time doing?"
 I succeeded with my goal of making him laugh.

He was looking past her, and she turned around with a frown.
 "What are you looking at?"
 "That guy over there--the tall blond one.
 Do you recognize him?"
 She frowned at the blond for a moment and then gasped.
 "He's on that lawyer show we watch!"
 She stared, and Rick smiled at her awe.
 She didn't turn back around until the actor was gone.
 Looking at Rick with wide eyes, she said, "You told me we probably wouldn't see any movie stars."
 "We were lucky."

“She is a beautiful horse.
 I wish to see her when you return.”
 “I promise,” Dieredon said.
 Aurelia released his hand.
 “May Celestia watch over you,” she said as he left.
 “And she over you,” Dieredon replied.
 Then he was gone, through the forest and back into town.
 There he bought a sturdy horse and began his long ride south to the Quellan forest.

As the curtain finally came down, I brushed away the traces of tears that'd appeared on my face during the performance, and turned in my seat as the lights came up.
 Alec was gone.
 The drapes were swaying gently as if they'd been brushed by someone moving quickly, but other than that there was no trace of him.
 It wasn't until I'd filed out into the grand foyer, eager to spend a few minutes taking in the gorgeous bronze statues liberally scattered throughout the room, that I realized why I felt so odd.
 Part of the difference was the normal sensation of having vicariously been part of something larger than life.
 My head knew all I'd done was sit motionless while performers portrayed a fictional story.
 The rest of me felt as though I had just risked life and limb, seen people I loved killed, and played a small but tangible part in altering the course of history.
 Returning to my mundane, ever so boring life was an incredible letdown, but that didn't explain the hollow sensation that'd lodged itself somewhere between my heart and stomach.
 Illogical as it sounded, the only explanation for feeling as though a part of me had been ripped out and lost was Alec's having disappeared sometime between the last note and the final bow.
 It was unsettling.

“Cheep, cheep.” I winced at the annoying chirps, working to focus on Chevelle’s story.
 “Cheep, cheep, cheep.” My teeth gritted, but I could not block out the irritating sound.
 It broke into a melody that pierced my ears and I barely restrained the growl of frustration as I cursed the devil thing.
 That was when I heard the hollow thud of its body smacking the floor.
 I jerked upright.
 My ears were still ringing from the harsh song, but the bird lay dead on the wood planks below the window.
 Chevelle started to turn to find the source of the muffled thump and, before I realized what I was doing, I flicked my right hand and the bird’s body flopped behind a shelf out of sight.
 When Chevelle turned back to me, I stared right into his eyes as if I had not seen or heard a thing, wondering why he wasn’t still explaining the histories of Grah.
 He glanced past me… or maybe at the crown of my head.
 Like he was avoiding my eyes.

That make sense?
 Qurrah could make it do whatever he wanted.
 He let it run off and die, that first one he showed me.
 He was pretty shy about it.
 Don’t think he had any idea how I would react.”
 Harruq suddenly stopped and laughed.
 “You should have seen us, Aurelia.
 We spent the rest of the day chasing after mice so we could stomp them and have Qurrah bring them back to do tricks.”
 Aurelia smiled at the burly half-orc.
 “You really made them do tricks?” she asked.

Come read my newspaper.” “We have our own.”  She turned to escape.
 He caught her wrist.
 “Wait.
 I’m not going to hurt you.
 You-you don’t know how to get home, do you?”  When she didn’t respond, he said, “Just come look at my newspaper.
 You don’t have to come inside.
 Just sit on my veranda, and when the fog lifts, we’ll-we’ll see if we can find your house.” Afraid of becoming even more lost, she hesitantly followed him to some chairs and perched on the edge of one.
 The man ran inside, and before she could decide whether it was better to wait or leave, he’d returned with a newspaper.
 Marie read one headline: "Obama Popularity Index Declining."
 Neither the words nor the picture meant anything to her.

“I’m sorry, sweetheart,” he murmured, stroking her hair.
 As her sobs began to subside, he tightened his arms around her and pressed his lips to her ear to whisper, “Maybe you came to 2011 because there’s someone here to help you and care about you.” She pulled back a little and managed a small smile for him.
 “At least that’s an explanation I can live with.”  She took the handkerchief he offered her.
 He kissed her temple.
 “Why don’t we put all this stuff up and have it tomorrow?
 I’ll take you out to dinner tonight.” “You don’t have to do that.” “I bet you’d like to try out one of those buffets I told you about.” Her eyes widened.
 “A buffet?
 With lots of desserts?” He chuckled.
 “I know just the place.” Rick’s attentiveness calmed her, and she went to bed that night with a full stomach and an odd sense of security.
 Nothing about what had happened to her made sense, but Rick was right.

Rick handed her his handkerchief.
 "It'll be all right," he repeated softly.
 She took the handkerchief and blew her nose.
 "Do you have a mirror?"
 He pulled her visor down.
 She used the mirror to wipe the tears and kohl smudges from her face.
 Glancing at him, she said, "I don't know your name."
 "Rick.
 Rick Newman."
 "This must be strange for you as well."

Stay away from the half-orcs.
 They aren’t safe.”
 “Nonsense,” she said.
 She guided a hand across his chest, feeling the break.
 Her hand then traveled to his shoulder, and a deep frown grew across her face.
 “Who did this to you?” she asked.
 “The man in black, the one continuing to train the half-orcs.
 I approached him last night and he nearly killed me.”
 “Harruq is no threat to me,” Aurelia insisted.
 “And I have met Qurrah.

He would claim he was in extreme pain and he needed a doctor or anything as an excuse to escape to the outside world.
 These counselors had heard it all before; as former drug addicts they had used the same tactics.
 He was an adult and could leave the rehab center anytime he wanted, but the staff was well trained in convincing him otherwise.
 Everyone I talked to at Narconon had been through the program themselves and were former addicts.
 The young man assigned to our son was wonderful.
 He explained that he had been through over a dozen programs before this program resolved his cravings and addressed his issues.
 He had been clean for six years, and I could only pray for the same result.
 He had worked there since he graduated the program and he assured me they would do their best to help Brandon.
 The facility where Brandon was staying was nearly a nine-hour drive from our home.
 We talked to Brandon on the phone occasionally and every time we did it was as if a cloud was slowly lifting and he was starting to think more clearly.

Had I imagined it?
 Was I losing my mind?
 My head came up once more, and the woman gasped.
 It was Junnie.
 Her cloak had fallen, her golden curls a welcome sight.
 Relief flooded me.
 “Junnie!” “Freya,” she murmured, reaching out to stroke a strand of my black hair.
 The shock of seeing her disappeared at the reminder.
 “Are you here for council?
 To collect me?” My voice was colored with the shame of being a criminal.

“I would have it no other way,” the man in black said.
 “Now tell me your name.”
 “I am Qurrah Tun.”
 “And I am Velixar.
 Rise, Qurrah, and join me by the fire.
 Ever since I felt your presence back at Veldaren, I have yearned to speak with you.”
 The half-orc took his seat opposite the man.
 He stared at Velixar, hardly believing what he saw.
 His face was smooth, his lips small, and his sunken eyes glowing a deep crimson.
 His features, however, kept changing.

That God likes Eugene.
 Art – At that I can only wonder why.
 Jim – I think it’s because Gene just doesn’t give up.
 Either that or he just keeps God amused with his foolishness.
 Art – Jim, that’s not true.
 He gives up all the time.
 When was the last time he actually saw one of his schemes through to the end?
 Jim – His little plans are nothing.
 If one fails he tries something else.
 The schemes are just a part of his bigger goal of making a huge nuisance of himself and not getting killed while doing it.

1.Promote small businesses: All the publicity given to the impact of down-sizing by major corporations has obscured the fact that the top 500 US firms employ less than five per cent of the US workforce.
 It is also the smaller firms that are responsible for job growth.
 Businesses employing fewer than 20 workers presently account for 57 per cent of new job creation in Europe.
 Based upon the successful examples of many developing countries that have stimulated growth in this sector, there is vast scope for expanding services to support new enterprises through better access to management and employee training courses, credit and R & D facilities; by testing and certification for those who want to start businesses; and by estab lishing business incubators to provide work space and shared services as well as technical, financial and marketing expertise to start-up companies.
 2.Reduce business failures: New businesses create most of the jobs, but they destroy most of them too, by going out of business.
 The failure rate of new businesses is extremely high in most industrial nations.
 In Italy, roughly 50 per cent fail in the first year.
 Of the more than 600,000 new business start-ups in the United States each year, 40 per cent close within 12 months, 80 per cent within five years, and 80 per cent of the remainder in the subsequent five years.
 Expanding programmes for management training, small business education and counselling, marketing assistance and financial management can bring down the failure rate dramatically.
 3.Voluntary part-timism: Increasing the flexibility of working hours will serve the interests of both businesses and workers.

My head screamed.
 The sound of metal bands snapping echoed through a scraping, screeching noise inside my head.
 I pressed my palms against my temples.
 I didn’t know I was going down until my knees hit the hard rock.
 I held myself there, refusing to give in.
 They argued frantically.
 “Knock her out.
 Do something.
 She’s going to crack.” Yes, crack.
 That was a good word for it.

she said, laughing with happiness and relief.
 "I've never before lost you for five weeks and three days."
 She turned to put her arms around him.
 "I love you, Father."
 "I love you too, darling.

 Marie caught her breath.
 In her misery over leaving Rick, she hadn't gotten around to thinking up a plausible story.
 "I-I'd rather not talk about it."
 "Not talk about it?"

She was bewitching him and even Buddy, already high from making music, was not immune.
 Today people still talk about Lorelei Enos with a wary reticence.
 “Not much is known about her,” you hear people say.
 “She came in on a bad wind and left on another,” one roadie told me.
 “Lori was beautiful, a beautiful person, a beautiful body, but she was half siren.
 She couldn’t help it,” another groupie remembers.
 “She was Satan’s mistress,” a musician, who wishes to remain anonymous, summed her up.
 That first night Buddy went home with her.
 What happened there is shrouded in mystery, except Skippy recalls Buddy saying, “She had the most beautiful sex I’ve ever seen.
 It tasted like mushrooms and ginger ale.

Obsidian buckles and clamps held the pieces together.
 The only color was a yellow scorpion emblazoned on the chest.
 “Why the scorpion?” he asked.
 “The orcs have forgotten Karak, whom they once served.
 They worship animals as their gods, believing they take strength from them.
 The warlord who wore that armor worshipped the scorpion.
 It is appropriate, for his opponent crushed him underneath his heel like one.”
 Harruq folded the armor as best he could and clutched it to his chest.
 “My thanks, master,” he said.
 “We do not deserve what you have given us.”

His head, which may have contained the purest, most discerning mind of our generation, rammed against a granite boulder.
 Cars
 I have always loved cars.
 Though I can’t draw any better than either of my daughters could at three years old, I spent thousands of bored minutes in grade school sketching sleek, rocket-like cars.
 From my first memories until I was ten, my dad was a route salesman for a wholesale meat company.
 He drove a Chevy bobtail.
 The box was insulated and chilled by blocks of dry ice.
 Whenever school was out, I used to ride with him on overnight runs to El Centro, in the desert, which in the summer turned so hot, I imagined all the inhabitants were escaped criminals who figured the police wouldn’t chase them into that hellish air.
 Going over the mountains in the truck cab with my dad sitting tall behind the wheel and jamming the mysterious floor shift back and forth, I gazed down at the other drivers and passengers and felt safe and full of everything that mattered.
 Many dozens of times, I rode with my dad on the narrow and winding two-lane highway past the very boulder that crushed Eric’s head.

I didn’t have a chance in hell at getting the officers to give me the go-ahead.
 I just said it because a father does whatever he can do to help his son.
 At least that is what I had always thought and that is what I had always done.
 Brandon looked at me as if he wanted to stop me but he lacked the clarity to speak, desperation the only thing evident on his weary face.
 The days since Brandon’s arrest had been some of the toughest days of his life.
 We know that the practice of turning your busted drug users and dealers into snitches was nothing new in the world of illegal drug distribution.
 I had consumed my fair share of drugs and wasn’t just some innocent bystander.
 I had my own issues.
 Maybe this was somehow Karma.
 They certainly don’t have a book that can teach you how to be a good father and my own experiences as a son and a stepson had only given me insight on what not to do as a father.

I mean, I just started the class obviously, but it just seems confusing.
 Your syllabus says we're talking about the preterit today."
 The only other person I'd ever met who could've even come close to pulling off such an innocent expression was Rachel, and I wasn't sure even she could compete with Dominic today.
 If I'd found her standing in front of a broken window with a rock in her hand, and she'd told me she had no idea why the window had shattered, all the while flashing me that look, I would've believed her.
 Mrs. Tiggs apparently wasn't quite so gullible.
 "It's a reasonable question, as the two subjects are highly related.
 One could almost say they're so close to the same thing that any distinction is purely arbitrary."
 Now Dominic looked both innocent and confused.
 "But why are they so far apart in the book then?
 I mean my Spanish book in the school before I came here had them pretty widely spaced too."

 But try being in love anyhow, it’s just great.
 It’s even better than playing video games.
 Jim- Better than video games?
 That’s a tough call I think.

 I’d give up video games before I gave up being in love.
 It’s a great feeling.

I still had my pants on when she offered to buy the Oxy.
 I noticed that she had left the door to the bedroom wide open and I wondered if someone was listening.
 I told her I was a “professional” and a “family man” and it just wasn’t worth the risk.
 She said she understood but if I changed my mind, she and her boyfriend would pay $25 per pill.
 I said thanks, but no thanks.
 She asked me to finish undressing and get on the bed for the massage.
 She stood directly in front of me, just a few steps away as I took off the last of my clothes and I stood there naked.
 I felt as if she stood there for me to prove l wasn’t a cop, who likely would leave at least his underwear on.
 She pointed to the bed that was now covered in a bright beach towel.
 I laid face down and she didn’t offer anything to cover me up as you would in a traditional massage.

Nauseous, I stepped into the pool, sinking beneath its surface.
 A thought crossed my mind that was darker than the rest, that said maybe I should stay under, but the pressure to draw air stung my lungs.
 I could not drown the desire to breathe.
 I pushed through the water, gasping and cold, struggling to climb from the muck as I stood and walked out.
 I was drenched, the material of the long gown soaked and heavy and more uncomfortable than ever.
 I loosened the wet corset ties and dropped the dress into a pile at my feet, shivering as I stepped free of it and onto a rock.
 I grabbed a shirt from the pile, and then the slim pants, aware of how nice the fabric felt, how good the cut.
 A leather vest laced over the top.
 It seemed they were tailored for me.
 I’d never had such luck making my own clothes.

 She noticed and crossed her arms.
 “Velixar’s gift,” she said.
 “Do you still desire it?”

"How can you know that when sometimes I'm not sure myself?"
 Almost without realizing it, I moved my hand from his arm to his stomach, and then wrapped both arms around him and pressed my face into his rock-hard chest.
 "Thank you for saving my life.
 Were those wolves some of Brandon's friends?"
 I felt him nod.
 "Simon and Nathanial."
 "I didn't know them that well, they mostly ignored me, but I didn't think they'd kill me."
 Alec finally put his arms around me.
 He hugged me like I was made out of fine china, but it was a start.
 The tingling sensation I'd always felt around Brandon was back, stronger than ever.

Rodregas felt a stab in his back as he took either an arrow or a sword.
 He was groggy with pain, and both weak and filled with rage.
 The guard in his hands was thrashing and spasming in unspeakable pain.
 As the guard collapsed to the ground, Rodregas fell with him.
 He tried to once more roll to the side, struggling away from a potential final stroke.
 Rodregas’ face was covered in gore and blood.
 It was hard for him to see.
 He struggled back up, but fell, then Rodregas felt a presence to his right.
 It was too small to be Doi’van and Rodregas staggered over reaching for him, determined to take one final slaver with him.
 His wounded leg buckled again, and Rodregas tried to reach for the ground to slow his fall, but something was wrong with his arm and it did not move.

Johnny – Yeah, the beatings and stuff.
 Jim – For the most part yeah.
 Johnny – What do you mean for the most part?
 Jim – I think he tones it down some.
 I think he’s gone through worse than I can imagine.
 Johnny – Why hasn’t he told anyone?
 Jim – He doesn’t like to have people pitying him.
 At least that’s how I think he works.
 Johnny – What does that have to do with anything?
 Jim – If everyone knew about him it would change how the acted towards him.

Qurrah stunned his brother by falling to one knee and bowing his head.
 “Greetings, master,” Qurrah said.
 “I have brought him as you asked.”
 Delighted, Velixar grinned as he surveyed the tall, muscular half-orc.
 As with Qurrah, he saw the untapped potential, incredible strength, and skill waiting for a purpose to harness it.
 The subtle shift of Velixar’s features slowed as he approached.
 When he spoke in his deep, rumbling voice, Harruq struggled against a sudden urge to join his brother on one knee.
 “So you are Harruq?” the man in black asked.
 “I am,” Harruq said.
 Velixar reached out a hand.

It seemed as if he feared that if he moved, his inclusion in the discussion would be challenged.
 Jordaan, apparently satisfied with their attention, continued “Our ability to manipulate the sources of mana seems to be a relationship of our blood connection to a realm.
 Mortals, to a greater or lesser extent; have an ability to tap into the mana that has overflowed into our realm from the Celestial, Infernal and Elemental Realms.
 I, for one, believe that if our connections to these realms were cut,” Jordaan made a motion like knife cutting a loaf of bread, “that in a few years there would not be enough magic for us to use.” “Luckily, I can think of no way for such a thing to happen.
 But a mortal’s ability to use mana that has spilled into the mortal world is very limited.
 The Immortalists have overcome this limitation by incorporating certain people’s direct connection to these realms.
 “So,” Jordaan continued, “if a mortal can add a Celestial’s ability to directly tap the Celestial power, he becomes far stronger.
 If the magic user can also tap into the Elemental powers, he again becomes far more powerful.
 Of course, the end goal of the Immortalists is to become a god.
 There are limitations; if an Immortalist were to incorporate a celestial ant’s connection to the Celestial, he would gain in power.

On Point Loma, in Fort Rosecrans, Eric’s dad’s grave lies in a clearing with no shrubs or trees nearby to mark the spot yet, even in the dark, Eric walked right to it.
 He knelt beside it.
 A couple feet down from the headstone, he dug out a piece of sod, dropped a candy heart underneath it, and replaced the sod.
 We left the cemetery and parked just outside, and sat on the ground with our legs hanging over, about fifty feet above where the waves flooded the tide pools.
 Once before in this spot, Eric had mused that whenever he died, he wanted his ashes scattered from here, out toward the beach and sea.
 Several times, he placed a candy heart on his tongue, chewed slowly, and washed it down with the wine we had brought.
 “I’ve got to tell you,” he said.
 “The big change still hasn’t come, but it’s getting awfully close.” “Hey,” I argued, “you already got kicked out of school, you’re working full-time and don’t much hang out with friends anymore.
 Now you’re ready to start adult school, right?
 Did you sign up yet?” “Not yet.” “Anyway, do you hear that word, adult?

But I begged her to keep our secret, for her protection…
 And then several pages were torn from the diary before it continued.
 It was an accident.
 A product of her temper, her human emotions.
 They were testing her, a servant told me.
 Anvil was holding her back, Rune with magic.
 She snapped and they saw her power.
 Some denied the possibility but not my father.
 He has attained his prize, that which he has always coveted.
 I will stop him.

 Eugene – I’m going to test out my new name.
 There’s gotta be a few Japanese tourists somewhere around town.
 I am GODZILLA!
 (Walks off stage)
 Liz – He’s not going to get himself hurt is he?
 Jim – Hard to say, this has got to be more harmless than some of the other things he was doing though.
 Most likely he’ll just get chased off by some angry tourists.
 Liz – What’s he done that is worse than this?
 And what did he mean when he said ‘you’re good at this sort of thing.’

It was nearly 7:00 when they left, and Marie was all in favor of pizza in the room this time.
 "I don't think I can wait," she told Rick when he hung up the phone after ordering the pizza.
 "Do you want me to go get you a candy bar?"
 "No.
 I'm going to go take a shower while we wait."
 After her shower she rubbed on some rose-scented lotion.
 Her skin was hot from her day in the sun and just a little red.
 She'd put sunscreen on this morning so that she wouldn't get burned.
 Dropping the bottle onto the bed, she went back to Rick's room calling, "Is the pizza here yet?"
 "Not yet," he replied as he emerged from the bathroom, still toweling his hair dry.

He was learning what it meant to work full days, to budget money, and generally act responsible.
 He meant to enroll in adult school and complete his senior year that way, meanwhile saving all he could toward the date of his graduation when he would go looking for some kind of apprentice white-collar job, maybe in another town.
 Probably San Francisco.
 Unless he got drafted.
 The way he talked was eerie and distressing, as if he meant to leave tomorrow and probably never come home.
 On his more effusive evenings, he might offer advice and wrest promises out of me.
 He asked for a promise that I would go straight to college, because a guy as smart as me simply ought to, and it would please my mom, who could use some cheering after her sorrows.
 He had witnessed how any talk of college made her glow.
 Besides, he didn’t want to see me get drafted.
 “You’d have a hell of a time in the service,” he said.

He was still trying to disengage my arms from around his neck, but it was obvious he didn't want to hurt me, and I was holding on with everything I had.
 "No, you don't understand.
 This whole time I thought I was in love with Brandon, I didn't even know him.
 You did so much for us and didn't even hate me when I was so rude.
 I've been so stupid, please don't send me away."
 I was halfway to another attack before Alec finally put a finger to my lips and nodded.
 "Very well.
 I should send you away for your own protection, but I'm too selfish to do what's best for you.
 Maybe later I'll be able to do what's right, but not right now, not so soon."
 Chapter 22 Rachel met us at the door with a shy smile that let me know any hard feelings would evaporate instantly if I wanted to be friends again.

The three stood in the center of the town, corpses scattered in all directions.
 There was an eerie silence creeping about, its soft touch tickling Harruq’s spine.
 He held the hilts of his twin blades in his hands, drawing comfort from them.
 At that dark moment, it was his only comfort.
 “You know what I ask of you,” Velixar said.
 “I do,” Qurrah said.
 “I pray I do not disappoint.”
 He closed his eyes, his hands stretched to either side.
 His fingers hooked and curled in strange ways, many times so twisted and odd that Harruq could not bear to watch them dance.
 Words spilled from the frail half-orc’s lips.

Our mother was intelligent, at least for an orc, but was she smart enough to leave us clues within our own names?”
 “Well, he’s dead now, so we’ll never know,” Harruq said, tossing the blade onto the floor.
 Qurrah, however, was far from dismayed.
 He grinned at his brother and then spoke in his hissing voice.
 “Would you like to have a conversation with our dear old dad?” he asked.

 The body of Ahrqur Tun’del lay atop several strange markings and shapes drawn in the dirt.
 He remained wrapped in the blankets and sheets the two half-orcs had used to smuggle him out of his house.

I settled deeper into my seat, opening my program as the orchestra started warming up.
 It was amazing to think the near-chaos currently drifting up from the pit would transform itself into the glorious strains of the Overture in just a few minutes.
 I was so intent on the program it should've taken a small explosion to bring my head around, but something caused me to look up as Alec walked past the drapes.
 He looked even more gorgeous than normal.
 I'd gone back and forth, both with myself, and with Rachel, on how much to dress up.
 Going in normal street clothes would've cheapened the experience, but I hadn't wanted to stick out too much from the rest of the kids, all of whom I'd been pretty sure would be in shorts and polos.
 I'd been right, which had made me glad I'd compromised and come in my one and only sun dress.
 Alec apparently hadn't gotten the memo.
 He was in an honest-to-goodness full tux.
 I wasn't the only one stunned by how good he looked; there was a ripple of turned heads as people noticed his entrance.

The very air seemed to strum like a stringed instrument with the gathered magical power.
 Rodregas could not help but think about how out of his depth he was trying to interfere with the ritual ceremony.
 However, as he forced the beautiful woman forward, the woman whose name he had refused to learn, he knew he was indeed going to try.
 “I will do it this time,” Rodregas thought to himself, “This time I will not choose my survival over others.” His life was not worth living if he did nothing again; he wanted to feel at least a small measure of being the man he had been raised to be.
 “Celestial Gods, please let my life be worth something in death, if not in life,” he prayed quietly.
 Captain Poir and Rodregas carefully put the two prisoners in the middle of their circles, and then stepped out.
 They each picked up small wooden clubs.
 Dale and Junnit stood across from the two of them holding matching clubs.
 The ceremony required the prisoners to stay in each circle unbound.
 The job of the guards was to remain outside the circle but make sure that the prisoners stayed inside.

Food Security
 Despite great achievements in the post-war period, we live in a world of persistent hunger amidst plenty.
 Presently, around 800 million people living in 46 countries are malnourished and 40,000 die every day of hunger and hunger-related diseases.
 Widespread famine currently threatens nine African countries, where the lives of 20 million people are at risk.
 Hunger and famine are usually associated with a physical shortage of food.
 Yet, even where food supplies are adequate, absence of opportunities for gainful employment to generate the purchasing power needed to buy food can result in hunger.
 Lack of food and employment are the basis for the poverty that still afflicts one-fifth of humankind.
 When it comes to food there can be no justification or excuse – everyone must have enough to eat, and can have enough.
 A world dedicated to upholding the political rights and property rights of nations and individuals cannot fail to recognize and enforce the most fundamental of all human rights – the right to live.
 Contrary to the fears raised in earlier centuries and revived in recent decades, today the world does possess the capacity to feed everyone, even at current levels of food production – subject as it is to disincentives, quotas, restrictions and trade barriers that food surplus countries impose to curtail food production, while other nations remain in perpetual deficit.

“You know they will not.”
 Antonil glanced at the elf, who was painted in camouflage and still wore his wicked bow slung across his back.
 He sighed.
 “You’re right.
 I do know.”
 Silence followed.
 The two continued staring, each wishing to speak their mind but unable to summon the courage.
 “You are a wise man,” Dieredon said, breaking the moment.
 “You know who is in the right in this conflict, as do I.”
 “Yes, we both do,” Antonil agreed.

“All things are for a reason.
 Even those who dwell in the darkness such as I will not deny this truth.
 You were meant for me.
 I will train you, and you will aid me in sundering all that brings false stability to this chaotic world.”
 “For death and power,” Qurrah whispered.
 “For Karak,” Velixar corrected.
 “When can I meet your brother?”
 The half-orc shrugged.
 While he seemed calm, the man in black did not miss how his eyes still refused to meet his.
 “Give me time,” Qurrah said.

 "But have you?"
 "No."
 She laughed.

I decided that I didn’t want to be shredded like some old rug, so I moved out of his path.
 That was the worst mistake I made, without even realizing it.
 At the same time another Thrasher was heading in my direction, and by moving out of the way from the first one, I had placed myself in the path of the second one.
 It slammed into my side at such a great force I tasted blood in my mouth, when I hit the ground.
 Then I felt pain, saw blood, and then nothing at all.
 Chapter 4
 I heard muffled voices around me as I regained consciousness.
 My head throbbed slightly, and so did my side and my tongue.
 That explained why I had tasted blood; I must have bitten it.
 For a second I thought I had returned to my human self when I heard a blast of fire that probably came from Emily.

A permanent, well equipped UN force made up from 20–30 member states should be placed at the disposal of the Secretary General for rapid deployment in conflict zones under Article 43 of the UN Charter to enforce the decisions of the Security Council.
 Either the Military Staff Committee of the UN could be revitalized to give strategic direction to any enforcement action, or a new structure should be created of member states supplying troops to any UN operation, chaired by the Secretary General.
 Member States should earmark national troops for use in UN Chapter VII enforcement action, the scope of which should be expanded to include humanitarian intervention under circumstances when national governments are either unable or unwilling to protect their populations from imminent threats to their survival.
 6.A cooperative collective security frame work must be evolved that is inclusive of all nations and guarantees their security against acts of external aggression.
 A standing international military force or World Army should be established under a democratic framework to provide unconditional security guarantees to member countries against aggression by other nations.
 If such a force cannot be established at the present time under the UN, then there is need for a separate organization similar in constitution to NATO but open to all nations that practise democratic principles of national governance, contribute financial and defence resources to a common armed force, accept ceilings on national defence expenditure and eschew the possession of nuclear weapons.
 The army should consist of both a directly recruited standing force and forces placed on call by member nations.
 7.The use of nuclear weapons should be declared by the UN a crime against humanity.
 First use by any nation must automatically invoke the strongest collective security measures by the UN Security Council.
 Based on the precedent of the Chemical Weapons Treaty, the proposal for a universal ban on the possession of nuclear weapons by any nation should be placed before the Security Council for a vote.

 "Hold on there.
 Do you always skip breakfast now?"

 Introduction by Camel Jeremy Eros
 The veracity of the following has been called into question.
 That the people who would know, the people who were actually there, all three voices heard here, are all dead makes proving it somewhat difficult.
 Buddy Gardner died, famously, of a heroin/pill/alcohol overdose;   Lorelei Enos died only a few years ago by her own hand, after an incident, which was kept out of the papers because of the famous talk show host involved.
 And, Creole Myers, the interviewer, died just last year of cancer.
 But, if you listen, that is, if you can read between the lines here, you’ll find, not only an extraordinary document, but one that could only come from the personalities involved.
 The voices are theirs.
 The story is theirs, even as it belongs to a generation.
 Let us hearken back, briefly, to those days when music was being made because it was important, because genius finds its own level, because people needed godhead, if that’s not overstating it.

At some point, we knew he was back into drugs, we just hoped he wasn’t getting himself addicted.
 We were kidding ourselves; we felt so powerless.
 He was gaunt, broken out, nervous and angry, telling random stories that always involved the biggest-fastest-shortest-longest-cue-the-orchestra-everybody fucking him over.
 He’d always have to go save someone in some dramatic fashion.
 The things that would come out of his mouth were completely unbelievable lies and his ignorance was evident to all.
 As a parent, I was humiliated when Brandon spoke.
 We encouraged him to seek help, but as an adult Brandon had to want help and he had to consent to help.
 The thought of Brandon being addicted to drugs, overdosing, getting arrested was all too torturous to contemplate, but we did it anyway.
 How could we not?
 He was our son.

I could hear everyone's heavy breaths as we turned to face each other.
 Well, actually everyone turned to me.
 “So,” I said and wiped the sweat off my knife's handle, “that was something, wasn't it?” Emily put her hands on her hips.
 “Jazell, how the heck did you know how to kill those things?” She shook her head.
 “What were those things?” “Syphons,” I said.
 “I don't know how I knew where to stab them.
 I just did, alright?
 It was weird.” Seth shook his head and leaned against a tree.
 “How come you get some random power when the rest of us don't?” He gave me a fake pout.
 “It's not fair.” I leaned against the tree next to him and rammed my elbow into his side.

Oh, while you’re at it, pray for my dog’s soul, I don’t think he believes in Jesus either.
 Ned – I will pray for you, and I will have my church pray for you as well.
 You are truly lost, but God hasn’t given up yet.
 Now I see why I was compelled to come to this sinful affair.
 Have faith, obviously He has not forgotten you, and is even now trying to reach out.
 It is true the lord works in mysterious ways.
 (walks away)
 Jim – I hate when that happens.
 Art – That was the first time for me.

The house to her left didn't look like any house she'd ever seen before yesterday.
 And she was no longer in a garden--she was walking across a lawn.
 She wanted to keep walking, but with the fog disappearing and no garden in sight, she was afraid it was useless.
 She turned around, eyes down as she headed back to Rick's house.
 How would she get back?
 Was she stuck here?
 Her parents must be out of their minds with fear.
 And Davis--he was probably tearing the city apart looking for her.
 Or would after he'd finished work for the day.
 Now where had that uncharitable thought come from?

You said you held the power of a god.
 But you lied.
 You are nothing but dust.”
 Surrounded by fire and death, the half-orc stripped naked of his rags and donned the robes of his former master.
 Despite all the arrows and heat, they seemed in perfect condition.
 Even the stain of blood was already fading.
 Qurrah held the side of the hood to his mouth and coughed as the smoke grew ever thicker.
 “Goodbye, Velixar,” he said.
 Then he chose a direction and staggered away.
 Slowly, and with a few wide curves through the carnage, he found a way out.

Greg:  Are you feeling ok?
 (waves his hand in front of her eyes)
 Cindy: I mean what he’s done, he is known worldwide!
 Such talent, I wish I could meet him just once.
 Greg:  You’re not a robot are you?
 Or one of those body snatcher creatures from those movies…
 Cindy:  (Disappointed) Oh, well if you ever do meet him, will you get his autograph for me?
 (flirts) I would really appreciate it.
 Greg: …It doesn’t matter.
 Just don’t hurt me.

"Nope.
 You're going home tomorrow."
 That thought made him sad.
 "Listen, Marie, do me a favor when you get back."
 "What?"
 "Really think about-about your marriage."
 Her mouth fell open.
 "Why?"
 "You're so fun-loving and free-spirited.
 Marriage to-to .

She then sat back on top of me while she continued to talk to me and I watched her in the mirror as she pulled her top off exposing her bare breasts.
 I kept watching her in the mirror and she was watching me.
 It got quiet and I needed an ice breaker for the silence so I quipped that she certainly didn’t dress like a cop and she laughed.
 She bent at the waist as she put her hands to the side of my shoulders and she pressed her bare breasts against my back.
 She rubbed her breasts on my back and buttocks as she maneuvered her body over mine.
 I couldn’t help but be aroused.
 She leaned in close to my ear with her mouth, her young body firmly against my back, and then asked me seductively if I would sell her the Oxy.
 I told her I would find out how many I had and we could probably work something out and sell them to her.
 She then asked me to turn over and she sat on me, barely above my crotch.
 I immediately noticed a tattooed first name of “Steve” on her flat stomach, just right of her belly button.

She looked a bit out of breath, like she had sprinted at a run to the Dwello.
 She took a quick look at Doi’van and Rodregas and paled.
 Doi’van’s eyes were literally glowing red and he was tossing his horned head with his wild black hair flying.
 Imeralda had not seen him in such a mood before, not even during the battle with the slave caravan.
 Imeralda thought that Rodregas was only marginally better.
 The muscles of his neck and shoulders were bunched up and she could feel his anger through her bond with him.
 But he was also breathing deeply and through the bond she knew he was trying to control himself.
 Imeralda saw that Rodregas was also watching Doi’van.
 She thought he also recognized the danger of a Hellborn rage.
 Imeralda reached out to Rodregas first to try to get him to calm down and help manage Doi’van.

In front of me was an archway.
 Two entwined hooks were mounted on the top.
 Each side was twisted metal that ended in the ground.
 In the center, two pieces spun together and ended holding a pulsing, black crystal.
 You should have been able to look right through the archway but there seemed to be a sheet of transparent black glass in the way.
 “This is the door to Igneeria,” the dwarf pronounced proudly.
 I fought the urge to say, “No duh!” Jason looked up, mesmerized.
 “Epic.” “Epic?” Seth scoffed.
 “That’s all you can say?
 This,” he motioned to the dark archway, “can't be described by one word.” I smiled to myself.

Now that I am officially a knight, I want to bring my sworn men into the chamber and figure out what sigils I will choose.” At his words the men’s faces tightened and they looked at his supposed servants.
 Rodregas nodded his understanding.
 He also knew from his own ‘illustrious’ career as a guard that the others would follow the rules.
 They were not officers to be making judgments.
 “I know you don’t like my servants being a Hellborn and a Nymph,” he said keeping his voice light.
 “But they are my sworn men and I trust them; and it is my call.
 Now open the doors.” At the last part he let a sergeant’s voice ring out and it was more order than request.
 And like all good soldiers they immediately carried out his order.
 The door had a strange mechanism such as Rodregas had never seen before.

The coming celebration had been the talk of speculation for months as well as the object of more than a little betting among the guards.
 Rodregas nodded, his thoughts swirling as he realized that he could use the celebration to his benefit.
 Without looking at the captain he walked toward the stairway, and the captain followed close behind him.
 At the door Rodregas took a deep breath and said, “Captain, that ceremony did not go smoothly, but the gods once again proved to favor me, and I wish to be generous with the birthday ceremony.
 Tell the purser to pay everyone an extra month’s wages today and give everyone a week off to spend as they wish.
 Make sure you tell Purser Stevents to be generous.
 I want all staff rewarded, even the kitchen drudges.” He finished, hoping it did not sound as halting and made up as he knew it to be.
 “Yes, sir,” replied Captain Poir, his expression going from a guarded concern to enthusiasm.
 He seemed reassured when Rodregas mentioned Stevents.
 He must have thought either Ravenhurr had been a bit damaged by the ritual or that the young man whose body he now inhabited might still be alive and faking it, obviously the young man would not know about Stevents.

He knew Marie would be embarrassed.
 Women of 1927 weren't supposed to be so forward with a man, even if they weren't, as she was, engaged to another.
 But her kiss and the way she'd touched him made him think that maybe he could win her love.
 Maybe he could convince her to stay in 2011 with him.
 He returned to the room with the Cokes and opened the box.
 "Mmm—it smells great."
 He put a slice on a plate and handed it to her.
 "Thank you," she mumbled, not looking at him.
 "Marie."
 He caught her free hand and squeezed it until she looked up at him.

Harruq’s blood heated at the thought of battle, but the coldness in his stomach refused to succumb.
 “Vaelor cannot yet risk war,” Velixar continued.
 “He must have all the people see him as a peaceful man driven to conflict.
 History does not favor the warmongers, not among the peasants and scribes.
 They favor so-called great men, driven to war by horrid acts of others.”
 The man in black spat his disdain.
 “It is a sad age when conquerors are seen as warmongering butchers and the cowards backed into corners are seen as the true heroes.
 Ashhur can be blamed for poisoning so many with such rubbish.”
 “What will the king do?” asked Harruq, his hands rubbing the hilts of his blades.
 “He has already evicted elven blood from his kingdom.

CM:  	Right.
 Um, when did you get your first real guitar?
 BG:  	That was—oh, when I was eleven, I think.
 I had played around on an old box guitar Dad brought home—I think it was a gift from Mr. Delisi actually.
 We had to sort of sneak it into the house (laughs) but it was old and didn’t sound very good, though I had fun trying to pick out Carter Family or Pete Seeger songs on it.
 Or blues chords.
 And, of course, I had a Mel Bay instructional book.
 I think Dad heard me, saw that I was progressing beyond his wildest dreams and bought me that electric guitar, without asking Mom, without thinking it was her business, you know?
 He saw that I was really good, that I could be something special.
 So he bought me this electric—it was a Hofner Futurama, if you can believe it.

The Chevelle sitting unfinished in the garage had become a grim symbol of the disappointment I felt with my son.
 Instead, I arranged to have it towed to a friend’s shop with the agreement that Brandon and I would show up together twice a week and work towards finishing the project with the assistance of a professional (and the expectations of someone other than Dad).
 It didn’t work to bring Brandon back.
 I warned and warned, but no matter how much I warned him, he continued his journey to the dark side.
 He was over six feet tall and weighed less than 140 pounds.
 He was sickly, late to every family event and completely high when and if he showed up.
 He was a constant embarrassment at large family gatherings as he was the last to show and the first to go.
 When our Chevelle was ready for its maiden voyage, he was a no show.
 I delayed starting the car for hours, expecting he might be late, but he never showed.
 That car started for the first time since I had taught the boys to drive, and Brandon missed this moment because drugs were now more important to him than anything or anybody.

He knew the thought to be a silly one even as it crossed his mind.
 It was quickly replaced with concern.
 For a second he thought that he was tied down, but Rodregas could see enough to determine that his restraints were tightly tucked bed sheets.
 He must be very weak.
 “Easy there young man,” said the old Nymph.
 The Nymph slowly helped him up and held a bowl to his mouth.
 “My name is Durien and I am healer, please slowly drink this.
 Rinse your mouth out with it as your mouth is probably very dry after all this time.” The drink tasted like tea or maybe a light broth.
 As soon as Rodregas started to drink it, he realized he was starving.
 “I need more,” Rodregas croaked as he finished the bowl.

He let out a screech and vaulted off her, running as fast as his legs could take him.
 I held an arrow out and Emily set it ablaze.
 I drew back, launching the arrow, and watching it as it hit the dwarf in the back.
 The fire charred its dying body and I looked away to face my new attacker.
 One jumped on my head and I swung with my knife.
 It yelled into my ear, “The one will rise, the one will rise!
 He will destroy you!” I stabbed at him again, “Who?
 You’re being too vague!” He jumped off me and ran into the woods.
 He disappeared before I could notch an arrow and shoot him.
 Soon we were alone again.

Mrs. Campbell was the only teacher who'd taken an active interest in my wellbeing, but I could see his point.
 I managed to do at least a passable job hiding my near frown as I nodded in acceptance.
 "Can I have just a few minutes today after school to tell her?"
 Alec's hand was warm on my face as he nodded.
 "You're amazing.
 All the things being taken away from you just because you got involved with the wrong crowd, and you just do what has to be done.
 Of course you can have a few minutes.
 I'm sorry to make you do this."
 I wanted to tell him it was less than he was doing.
 To say it was the least I could do considering this was all my fault, but the unabashed bliss of having him touch me was overwhelming.

 CM:  	That’s not on any album, is it?
 BG:  	No.
 I’m thinking about reviving it.

The ripple of skin and bone was so quick for a second I couldn't believe what I was seeing, but there it was.
 Alec's hand and fingers had elongated, turning into a hairless replica of the deadly claw that'd terrified me just a few days before.
 Vincent's bulk was such that it screened Alec's movements from passersby, as those razor-sharp claws sank just the barest distance into his chest.
 Alec spoke for the first time, and the even tone of his words was a stark contrast to the winds of power that seemed almost ready to throw me across the hall.
 "You forget yourself, mutt.
 As the leader of another pack, I'm due more respect than that.
 Should you or your dominant wish to push things further, I guarantee that your heart will decorate the floor before he can come to your aid."
 Brandon stopped moving as Alec's words carried to him.
 He was probably weighing odds and tabulating the probable cost of the various courses of action available to him.
 Vincent's life was likely a relatively small component in the grand equation.

Chapter 16: The Law Brandon had been set up by another drug dealer.
 This person had called our son from a wired phone while Brandon was with his mother— that so-called errand was a drug deal.
 He left his mother to straighten out his bills while he went to do a drug deal.
 Unbelievable.
 He was supposed to bring drugs to a hotel room, but because Brandon owed everybody money, his credit to be fronted drugs was not good, so he went to the drug deal without the drugs, planning to get the money first then go back for them.
 When Brandon knocked on the hotel room door, it opened and an army of police officers darting in from all directions greeted him.
 They wrestled him to the ground, cuffed him and began their search of him and his vehicle and, later, his house.
 Brandon had been recorded agreeing to the deal and he had paraphernalia in his possession.
 Unfortunately for the police, they chose to drop the net on him when he had hit bottom and couldn’t afford the drugs they hoped they would catch him with.
 During his 23-hour period in jail, the narcotics officers shook him down for everything he was worth.

It hurt me deeply to contemplate Thomas’s complete disregard for our relationship as brothers and his choice to take this merchandise from my addicted partner while knowing full well that it would financially destroy my business and thus me.
 Pete had already disappeared for several weeks when I discovered what he was doing, but it was too late and the business closed within a month after the invoices for all of these portable spas and waterbeds started arriving.
 The checking account had been completely drained of any operating capital.
 Bad business partner, and bad best friend: My girlfriend at the time, Karen, had hidden her drug habit from me, and by the time I discovered it she had emptied our joint savings account and was screwing my ex-partner/best friend, Pete.
 They were both very addicted to cocaine and I guess they belonged together because neither one of them belonged with me.
 I went to her apartment where I caught them together.
 I beat him within an inch of his life in front of her.
 Karen and her roommate did everything they could to pull me off of him but my rage for his complete abandonment of our friendship in so many ways had escalated to the perfect storm.
 It seemed he had taken everything from me and he had been my closest friend for the last six years and I snapped.
 This was a defining moment in my life, where I began to truly understand what drugs could make you do.

I think you are likely to do very well with that one.
 In fact, I think you would be wise to finish one of the top winners.
 The next is the bow…,” Doi’van glancing at Imeralda.
 Rodregas could not help but smile, “I know you guys think of my skill with the bow in terms of my inability to use the Black Yew bows.
 But really, I can shoot a bow with skill.” Doi’van and Imeralda looked at him doubtfully.
 “The challenge,” said Doi’van, “is not to be simply good but to be able to outshoot over one hundred other highly skilled warriors, and the targets are multiple and difficult including a moving target.
 Unfortunately, all the targets are within normal range for a human, your strength will not help.
 The good news is this is a competition of skill and they provide the bows.
 The bad news is that it is up to each competing squire to have his own equipment for the other three competitions.
 The sword and the shield competition are limited to light armor.

Once.”
 Harruq shook his head, hardly able to believe it.
 “You did?” he asked.
 “How long ago?”
 “Many years.
 Fifteen.
 Twenty.”
 “Why did you sleep with her?” Qurrah asked.
 “She filled me with drink and then tricked me,” the elven spirit said.
 “Never would I willingly have touched one of Celestia’s cursed.”

“Where are they?” I asked.
 He’d been looking at our hands, but his eyes returned to my face at the question.
 “Council,” I explained.
 “They have retreated.
 They were able to briefly incapacitate the wolves, giving Rhys and Rider less warning of their approach before you were attacked.” He hesitated.
 “When we heard the alert, I turned.
 Your eyes were closed.” I didn’t comment, so he continued, “I was able to catch you just before your horse dropped.
 I’ve no idea why they attacked him.
 They should have been focused on you.” I wasn’t sure they had attacked the horse.
 Maybe it was because I’d been there, in his mind, controlling him.

Did she wonder how she could ever feel complete again?
 But no--she was dead!
 The agony of that realization pierced his numbed heart.
 This was 2011; she'd gone back to 1927, been reunited with her family, probably gotten married and had children.
 Now she was dead.
 And she'd lived her life without him.
 Tears ran down his cheeks.
 The thought was too painful to bear.
 Around 1:00 he dragged himself upstairs, even though he knew he'd be unable to sleep.
 He took three Advil and lay down, throwing his arm over his eyes.

Political priority
 After the Second World War, developing countries that had suffered from recurring famine in early periods struggled to increase food production as an urgent national priority to keep up with surging population growth and spiralling demand for food.
 India’s Green Revolution was spurred by the imminent threat of severe famine in the mid-1960s.
 China was compelled to produce more food by the loss of perhaps as many as 30 or 40 million lives to famine in the late 1950s.
 But the very motive which stimulated these achievements moderated them as well.
 For while these governments took concerted steps to meet the minimum needs of the population for food, they tended to overlook the equally great potential to utilize agriculture as an engine for economic growth and job creation.
 Once minimum food needs were met, attention was diverted to other sectors of the economy.
 Politically, the elimination of the famine threat arising from food shortages is one of the reasons for slower growth in agricultural productivity in recent years.
 This has resulted in a marked decline in investment by developing countries in government-sponsored agricultural research and rural techno-infrastructure.
 This tendency has been compounded by the false notion that in order to achieve economic growth, new jobs must be created in industry and services.

She thought she was safe hiding here in the village but, as you know, an elf birth is a hefty event.
 Upon the hour of my birth, the entire village had gathered to see the new elf—at my father’s request, of course.
 Can you imagine the shock when they found my mother was his intended?” She laughed, but her audience was quiet.
 Chevelle, expression uncomfortable, turned to watch out the front window.
 “Needless to say, it did not go as she had planned.
 At her death, my father was released from her bonds.
 He was horrified at what he had done, at what had been done to him.
 But he hadn’t the heart to destroy his crop.
 He simply left.” I felt the tug in my chest at her story, but Ruby’s eyes were dry and clear.
 I wondered how many times she’d told it.

So what was the point in waiting?
 “I had a dream last night,” I began.
 “Only it wasn't really a dream, but more of a vision.” Seth nodded.
 “What was it about?” I told him about the cliff and how Kojas had killed the dwarf.
 I hesitated but told him what Kojas said about him too, and I saw him stiffen.
 “I'm sorry,” I found myself saying.
 Seth shook his head.
 “It's not your fault that he said those things about me.
 I'm happy you didn't try to keep it from me.” “What should we do?” I asked desperately.
 “Well we know that the dwarf is dead and that Kojas knows we're here,” Seth said.

“We understand perfectly,” Qurrah said, stepping to one side.
 “What has my brother done to warrant your attention?”
 “We’re on a quest,” said the man wielding the strange weapon.
 He had a stubbly beard and a hooked nose with a thick scar along the top.
 “A great quest from the king, you could say.
 We’re to rid scum from the city, elven scum.
 You know what I think?
 I think elves can look like anything.
 They’re devious little pricks like that, and you two seem rather ugly and devious, don’t you all agree?”
 The other guards laughed and shouted in agreement.

In the darkness, Qurrah watched as Velixar’s face curled into a deep snarl.
 “Celestia befriended both brothers, but she took Ashhur to be her lover.
 She begged each to stop, though neither listened.
 It was a dark time, Qurrah.
 All squabbles and wars since are a pittance compared.
 Ashhur’s great city of Mordeina nearly toppled to my hand, but then the priests of Ashhur brought the dead to life to fight against us.
 Yes, Qurrah, it was the priests of Ashhur, not Karak, who first created the undead.
 We were beaten back, forced into Veldaren with little hope of survival.”
 The man in black removed his hood to reveal a long scar.
 It ran from his left ear, across his throat, and down past the neck of his robe.

"It's bordering on stuff I shouldn't tell you, but you deserve to know.
 You've just described exactly how we perceive the world.
 The colors are all more vibrant, the breeze is more alive with scents than anyone could ever know."
 I felt my heart speed up a little as things started falling into place.
 "Your paintings.
 That explains them.
 You were superimposing what you see over top of what someone like me would see.
 Only how would you know what things look like to us?"
 Alec's chuckle held more than a little resignation in its timbre.

 He pressed his lips to hers.

 But then she hiccupped.

 "I've never kissed a girl with the hiccups before," he said, chuckling.
 "I'm sorry."
 She turned red and hiccupped again.
 He laughed.

Chapter 8: Boy Meets World I officially moved out of my parents’ home when I was 15 years old, 35 years ago.
 I didn’t have a driver’s license yet, but I had a learner’s permit.
 I had no car and I walked, bummed a ride or hitchhiked if I needed to get someplace like work or high school.
 It was not easy living on my own and finding roommates at such a young age, but I managed.
 After a short stint of crashing on couches or extra bedrooms of several friends, I rented a room at a house with some other kids near my age.
 I was still in high school and I wanted to graduate, but I also needed money to live on.
 Rent, food, utilities and various expenses were all new to me.
 The father of my girlfriend Lori was an executive of a supermarket chain, and he made some calls and got me an interview.
 The manager explained to me that he would love to hire me but he had a hiring freeze on everyone but minorities.
 I had no idea what this meant so I asked, and he explained to me all the types of minorities that he could hire, including, American Indian.

Seth spun around, bringing his sword up to block Kojas’ swords.
 Kojas pulled his swords back and slashed through the air.
 Seth ducked and stabbed at his opponents’ middle.
 Kojas brought his sword down and swiped Seth’s.
 It twisted out of Seth’s grip and fell to the ground.
 I wanted to scream, but I couldn’t.
 I was frozen in fear.
 Seth dashed to his sword, hand out stretched.
 Then Kojas raised a hand and something dark shot out of it.
 It slammed into Seth’s side and he fell to the ground.

Our king is a spiteful, paranoid one.”
 “Not my king,” Harruq muttered loud as he dared.
 He meant to say more but stopped as another man neared the fountain.
 He was large, well-muscled, and scratching at a long beard that stretched down to his belt.
 In a massive voice, he shouted to the mulling throngs.
 “The royal guard is in need of able-bodied men to help rebuild the walls of the city,” he shouted.
 “The work will be hard, but we offer a threepence of copper a day.
 Come to the castle and ask for Alvrik.”
 He repeated the message three more times and then wandered back north.
 “A threepence,” Harruq said.

To Rodregas’ relief no one was paying them any attention, not even to Doi’van.
 Rodregas and Doi’van did their best to block the view of others as Imeralda gathered the limp pale hand that should have belonged to an old man, not a young one, and slipped the small frog figurine into it.
 Quickly she channeled the power.
 Rodregas could feel the instinctive rise of the young man’s own power.
 Then the squire started to squirm weakly in pain.
 Both Doi’van and Rodregas reached out and steadied the young man until it was over.
 Imeralda straightened the sheets for the young squire.
 She then led Rodregas and Doi’van to the figure of a woman.
 She was short and muscular and older than average for the tournament.
 Her bed was more exposed and Rodregas could feel the attention of one of the healers.
