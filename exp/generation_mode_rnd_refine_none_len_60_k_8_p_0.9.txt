He smiled, stroking her hair.
 "Is there anything else you'd like to have?"
 She thought about it for a moment.
 "Could I have one of your t-shirts?"
 "Of course.
 Do you want to take your clothes with you?"
 "No.
 I could never wear them except when I'm alone, and when I'm alone, I want to wear your t-shirt.
 Will you go change into one now so that it will .

 “It is a beautiful blade,” Harruq said, examining the elven weapon that had belonged to Ahrqur.
 They were killing the final hour before dark.
 Then they would hoist the wrapped body onto Harruq’s shoulder and sneak out of town.
 Qurrah sat meditating in a corner while Harruq yammered to himself.
 The blade was in one hand, the decorative scabbard in the other.
 “He was a skilled swordsman,” Qurrah said.
 “He was also arrogant.

Maybe I still wasn't recovered from my ordeal on Friday; I felt like I was missing something obvious.
 Britney apparently agreed, and she wasted no time in letting me know what it was.
 "There are two in-crowds here; Brandon's group, which consists of all of the athletes and cheerleaders, and Alec's group, which is about half the size, and outside of his immediate friends is made up of a few geeks and misfits.
 You were on the border of getting in with Brandon, but just threw all of that away to save Alec's little sister when he's too much of a coward to do it himself."
 I wanted to protest, to explain why everyone should be able to get along, or point out that despite Brandon's obvious appeal, it was his friend who was wrong, but Britney had already turned and stalked off.
 I probably would've spent the next few minutes refining my arguments for the next time we talked, but the last thing Britney had said finally sank in.
 His sister.
 Rachel was Alec's sister, and he hadn't made a move to save her.
 He hadn't even been willing to let his friends step in and stop the fight.
 I drifted off to History thinking that I would've done almost anything to save my sister.

While monetary policy may prove useful for dealing with short-term adjustment problems within a relatively stable environment, there is no evidence to support its use as the principle instrument for social transition.
 Monetary variables are indicators of the functioning of an economy, but the essential factors which determine the strength and health of an economy are the productivity of its enterprises and its workforce and the material resources of the country.
 Tight monetary policy can generate intense short-term pressure for change in behaviour, but this pressure is applied indiscriminately and often with unexpected and unanticipated results.
 The primary result of premature liberalization of prices was to encourage trade and speculation while discouraging production and investment.
 It distracted attention from fundamental changes in institutions and social attitudes needed for the transition to be successful.
 Macro-level policy measures have to be complemented and supported by parallel micro-level efforts to educate the population about the new economic system, to generate a free flow of information – not just freedom, but the actual exchange of information, which is still severely limited in these countries – to develop new distribution systems, to impart appropriate business and managerial skills, to provide access to credit, to build up new social institutions and to en courage and promote new enterprises.
 In most cities of the former Soviet Union, for instance, there is not a single whole sale market for food.
 There are no systems for consumer credit, no agencies in charge of promoting small business development.
 In the absence of these and other essential micro-level conditions, even the right macro-level strategy will not evoke the anticipated response.
 6.Government regulation is essential for a free market: A free market does not mean an unregulated one.

She said they would buy the Oxys and they would meet me where I wanted.
 She assured me that there would be no bullshit this time.
 I told her I would call her and give her the meeting place after I filled the prescription.
 I called the lead narcotics officer and informed him of my conversation.
 Again he was amazed at my creativity with the concoction of the take away story.
 I told him why I did it that way and that I only wanted to wear a wire one more time.
 He said to call him to confirm the timing.
 A call to the officer confirmed we were on for 6 pm that night.
 I was instructed to call Ashley around 6 pm and tell her I would meet her as soon as I could get out of the house, and that I would call her when I left it.
 I prepared myself emotionally for another unpredictable evening.

The sixty dwindled to forty before fleeing.
 “Give chase,” Antonil shouted.
 “Those in the back, flush them out of the houses.”
 Velixar watched the Neldaren army scatter, some chasing elves down streets, others barging into locked homes.
 Screams of pain and dying, although just few and random, filled the air.
 He drank it in and smiled.
 “Where are you my disciples?” he asked.
 “Let me hear the screams of your victims so that I may find you.”

I leaned forward, resting my head on my knees.
 “Are you ill?” Chevelle said from beside me.
 I hadn’t even heard him come in.
 He was sitting forward on the bench next to me and when I jerked up in surprise, it put us too close.
 I tottered and he steadied me, but didn’t move away.
 He leaned closer.
 “You smell… like morning.” I bit my lip, heat rising up my neck, but he lingered, breathing in the scent.
 “Ruby,” I said.
 He looked confused.
 “Soap.” I had been reduced to one-word sentences.

All right."
 Somewhat dazed, she went to her room, only to find that she'd left her key in Rick's room.
 She returned, glancing up at him sheepishly when he opened the door for her.
 "I forgot my key."
 He retrieved it from the dresser and handed it to her.
 He kissed her lips lightly.
 "Goodnight, sweetheart."
 "Goodnight."
 She went back to her own room, wishing that she could sleep next to him all night.
 They drove down to Tijuana the next day, and Marie was delighted with all the shops and stalls and stands.

The end of her staff dislodged two more of his teeth.
 The soldier panicked and turned to run, but found his feet entangled.
 Aurelia marched over, remembering how difficult it had been to strike Harruq and how strong a blow he could take without showing pain.
 “Are you as strong as a half-orc?” she asked.
 Her staff collided with his ribs.
 He curled up at the blow, crying out in pain.
 Guess not, she thought.
 A shove put him on his back.
 He pleaded to her, sputtering blood, but she ignored him.
 “Some people should not reproduce,” she said.

She wasn't properly his.
 There was no bond of Ja'tell, and consequently we have no obligation to return her to him."
 Jasmin opened her mouth to say something else, but a tiny brunette, probably Jessica, interrupted her.
 "Alec, we have to do this.
 None of us are stupid; we know what's going to happen.
 You killed two members of his pack."
 There was steel in Alec's voice that I'd never heard before.
 "Still unacceptable.
 You've all aired your opinions; you can retire to your beds now."
 James looked up from where he'd been slouching against the wall, and I suddenly realized that he wasn't shaking from cold.

With his free hand he made a fist and slammed the side of her head.
 Not with all his strength, but still a serious hit.
 She grunted and let go, growled and stepped over the bear’s body.
 He slowly reached up, and using the full strength of his body, pushed hard on her muscular chest, pushing her away from the bear’s haunch.
 He then ignored her and went back to cutting the haunch loose.
 He waited but the two lionesses seemed to have gone from aggression to napping, with him missing the transition.
 Slowly, Rodregas got up with his bear haunch and took it back to the barn.
 He met the surprised look of Doi’van and Imeralda with a half smile, “I hope you like the taste of bear?” As he was unsure of how old the meat was, he immediately started a fire and started to cook it.
 As he worked on preparing the fire he explained what had happened.
 “Are you suicidal?” asked Imeralda in an angry voice.

I think my first blowjob was on the school playground, off in a corner, where there was this big bush.
 Cathy Ceccerelli.
 Man, she was hot, I mean for a thirteen year old.
 Great braids that hung on either side of her face.
 And the first girl in our class to get tits.
 She was something else—she let me touch her naked ass, showed me it right before she unzipped me and took me into her mouth.
 (laughs) I didn’t even know what was happening.
 I kept thinking, is this right?
 Is this something humans are supposed to do?
 And should I come?

He strode out of the house, heading for Mae's.
 Marie stared after him.
 She knew about sex.
 But-but .

 she'd thought it would be something pleasant.
 Was the harshness of his kiss indicative of what sex would be like?
 She couldn't sleep that night.
 After tossing and turning for hours, she got up and took a long bath.

But why couldn’t he just tell her what the article had said originally?
 She could draw her own conclusions about what the change in the article meant.
 Excited, he stood and headed for her room.
 But when he reached her door, he hesitated.
 Would she believe him about the article?
 She still felt loyal to that jerk, and she might not believe him.
 Especially since it was pretty obvious that he himself had something to gain by convincing her that she shouldn’t marry Davis.
 His sister had once told him that a girl usually wouldn’t even believe her best friend if she told her that her boyfriend was cheating on her.
 He went back to his office and read the article again.
 He should have shown it to Marie before he’d fallen in love with her.

More like acquaintances than friends.
 "You both used to be down in the kitchen eating breakfast at the crack of dawn almost every morning.
 Now it's like you don't even want to roll out of bed."
 She used to like mornings.
 I'd tagged along just because it hadn't seemed right to put a damper on such enthusiasm.
 Trust Mom to bring that up on my birthday.
 I swayed just a little.
 Today it didn't seem quite as bad, as long as I didn't think of her actual name.
 "Mom, I don't want to be late.
 Thanks a bunch for the cupcake.

She glared at him, trying to wrench her arm free.
 "You're hurting me."
 "Maybe that will remind you not to talk back to me."
 He released her with a slight shove and turned to stalk off.
 Marie's anger dissolved into pain, and she hurried to her room to hide her tears.
 She and Davis had been betrothed for just over five weeks, and during the last couple of weeks he'd lost his temper with her twice.
 Three times counting tonight.
 She didn't understand.
 Up until the last couple of weeks, he'd almost always been sweet and considerate.
 He had never been unkind to her before they'd become betrothed.

The three companions shared a blank look.
 The two men turned to Imeralda who simply asked the question, “Jordaan, you know I have had little magical training.
 I have been more of a prized blood mare than a wizard and these other two are warriors.
 I don’t think any of us know what ‘The One Law’ is.
 Jordaan looked surprised, but then nodded.
 “It is a law set forth by both the Celestials and the Infernals.
 Do you know the source of Magic?” he asked her.
 Imeralda nodded, “Sure, there are four sources of magic: mortal, Celestial, Infernal and elemental.
 It is one of the reasons I am prized for my potential with more than one power.
 My AElven ancestry is strong with mortal magic, but my Nymph side is strong in elemental magic.

Most of all, I wanted to feel our marriage was, if not secure, then solid.
 In the beginning, we clashed in both measly and crucial ways.
 She slept late, I rose early.
 She was a vegan.
 And a poet, and poets often thrive on spontaneity while novelists require a heavy dose of routine, if we’re to finish those windy monsters.
 After a year, Pam returned to school.
 Two schools--Bethel Seminary for yet another Masters degree and U.C.
 Riverside for a PhD in Comparative Literature.
 And at those schools, when she met a new crowd of young folks just launching out toward their dreams, she wondered how much she had given up by marrying a fellow who already thought about retiring, which caused me to wonder in turn if I should I steel myself to prepare for another breakup?
 And should I make sure that if it came I wouldn’t again have to slog through the morass of missing my kid.

I know it is natural to want to know who your father is.
 Unfortunately sometimes he is a complete jerk.
 Richard is just not a good person; actually he is quite the opposite.
 It was difficult for me to discover that my father’s lifelong friends didn’t even know he had sons.
 Besides being an alcoholic his whole life, I found out he was a first rate con-man.
 He was a womanizer, with a taste for young girls, and a big time loser.
 When I did try to let him into our lives, he was verbally abusive to me, my wife and even my children.
 The final disaster with Richard followed a family vacation.
 Richard invited himself to join our annual family beach vacation and I allowed it.
 Richard was to watch the kids, including my two boys and his boy and girl from a subsequent marriage, one night.

"I'm sorry, sweetheart," he said, handing her a washcloth as she straightened.
 "I should keep all these disturbing thoughts to myself."
 With trembling hands, she began washing her face.
 "I feel torn completely in two.
 I don't think I can ever be happy again.
 When I go back, I'll be miserably lonely for you.
 But if I were to stay here, I'd miss my family, my home, my roots.
 I'd feel misplaced.
 I'd worry about my family and how upset they are and how they'd always wonder what had happened to me."
 She took her toothbrush and put toothpaste on it.

 His heart constricted.

 "I'm sorry, sweetheart," he told her, scooting closer and putting his arms around her tentatively.
 When she didn't resist, he drew her closer.

It didn’t make sense official documents about Fannie would be among those relating to the apparent extinction of the northern clans.
 And why had all the documents I’d found about the tragedy been separated, mixed up, and missing pages?
 I tried to sort it out, but found there were other council documents there too.
 I kept reading, quickly scanning for something of interest.
 My eyes caught on his name a second before my mind recognized it… Chevelle Vattier.
 As I backed up to read, my shock and disbelief turned to fury before I could even finish the page.
 Chevelle Vattier had been a volunteer watcher.
 A Council spy.
 He had volunteered to watch me.
 Swift, white-hot anger flooded through me and the pages I held burst into flames.

So we drove to Cliff and Billy’s house to bum gas money.
 Their mom, Evelyn, called the hospital and learned that Eric was in the operating room, and that no visitors could see him that day.
 She tried to feed and comfort us.
 After those attempts failed, she gave us ten dollars and a shopping list.
 After we staggered through the aisles at the grocery store and delivered the bags to Evelyn, we drove up Mount Helix to the highest place in our town and paced around the big cross in the mountaintop park, staring all around at Mexico, the Pacific, and the Laguna Mountains.
 Every few minutes one of us would offer a reason why Eric couldn’t possibly die.
 He was the strongest person we knew.
 He was only seventeen.
 People needed him.
 We needed him.

 Rick touched her trembling lips.
 “But what?” "I was miserable without you, Rick.
 I realized that if I could just-just finalize things, say good-bye to my family and let them know I was safe and happy, then I wanted to be with you.
 I love my family and my home, but you're the man I want to spend the rest of my life with."
 His eyes were glistening as he nuzzled her temple.
 "Maybe you can visit.
 Maybe--" "No.
 I don't want to risk going back to visit and being unable to get back to you.

I was fairly certain my nose was bleeding from the impact.
 I tried to slow my horse but no longer had control of him.
 “Again,” Chevelle warned.
 The rock was coming for me a second time.
 I tried to duck out of the way but the wall was there once more, blocking me from moving.
 I cursed as the stone glanced off my cheek.
 “This isn’t fair,” I complained.
 It seemed he was holding me in place just to strike me.
 “It’s the only way, Freya.
 This is for your protection.” “I highly doubt they will pummel my face with rocks,” I spat out.

 I completely lost myself in his kisses."
 She caught her mother's look and smiled.
 "Yes, I really am still a virgin.
 But I'll admit--to you and to no one else, Mother--that that's just because Rick is a gentleman.
 And because he always put what was best for me before what he wanted.
 We would kiss and kiss and kiss, and then he'd stop and tell me we had to stop, or we'd end up making love.
 And I was never the one to stop, Mother.

The wave continued down the street, straight for Aurelia.
 “I do not fear you,” she hissed through clenched teeth.
 A wall of water swirled about her, flowing from the otherwise dry dirt street.
 She sent it forward, just as tall and high as Velixar’s.
 The two met in a thunderous roar, intermixing in a maelstrom of darkness, water, and air.
 Then they both dissolved, their magic spent.
 Aurelia held back tears.
 Velixar’s magic had peeled the flesh from the elves’ bodies.

Karen – What’s wrong?
 Jim – We got the z, the q and the x all at once.
 Art – Lucky, you got all the good letters.
 Eugene – I don’t think I know any words that have a z in them.
 Cleo – Of course you do handsome.
 Now be quiet and let me choose the letters.
 Ah, not bad.
 Eugene – Woah we can spell…
 Cleo – Don’t say it, that word is in poor taste.
 Eugene – Fun?

She caressed his cheek.
 "But what if you did?
 What if you kissed me so hard that-that my teeth cut my lips?
 What if--" "I would never, ever hurt you."
 He caressed her hair.
 "If I ever do anything that hurts you or that you don't like, tell me, and I'll stop.
 Right away.
 I care about you, Marie, and I'd rather never kiss you again than hurt you."
 She laid her head on his shoulder again.
 She believed him.

At least not without an outright admission on his part.
 Seeking to distract myself from a thoroughly useless train of thought, I looked around, trying vainly to pierce the curtain of black hanging around the feeble circle of light.
 "Are they out there waiting now?"
 Alec shook his head.
 "No, I'd already have come and carried you away if any of Brandon's people were around.
 Barring that, you'd hear us fighting.
 Mere doors and windows wouldn't do much to muffle the sound."
 "You'd be fighting, because of me."
 Alec slowly crossed the distance between us, and took my shoulders in his hands.
 "Please don't try and take the blame for this.

CM:  	Yet, the next song is definitely a more mellow, more, can we say California song?
 BG:  	“At City Lights I was Saved.’ Yeah.
 An homage to Ferlinghetti, his whole ethos, his whole mystique.
 He’s the patron saint of boho out here, you know?
 I wrote that song after an afternoon I spent with him and Michael McClure and Dylan at McClure’s place.
 We all had come from the bookstore—I was looking for, what was it, Lor?
 LE:  	Rexroth’s Chinese translations, I think.
 BG:  	Exactly.
 Yeah, so I had that in my hand.
 And there was Dylan with a copy of Teeth Mother Naked at Last.

 You're so fragile.
 All it would take is an accident, a momentary loss of control.
 I really am a monster."
 "No, you're not.
 I don't understand what you are, but you aren't a monster.
 Brandon is.
 Vincent, Cassie.
 They're all monsters, but you aren't."

I move slowly towards the coffee shop and my heart is beating out of my chest.
 So many thoughts are running through my head and I can’t seem to clear them.
 After the millions of thoughts and moments that have haunted me during this evening I begin to focus on my current life, not my past.
 I think of my wife who has been left in silence for nearly four hours.
 I think of my sons, Brandon completely fucked up from his drug addiction and Bryce away at college completely unaware of what is happening and what risk his dad is about to take.
 It occurs to me that Bryce and my wife may never forgive Brandon if something were to happen to me.
 I recall their little league baseball games and soccer teams I coached.
 All of the art projects which we proudly displayed with the help of refrigerator magnets over the years.
 Particular events in their life pop in and out of my head.
 Their future begins to enter my mind and I hope and pray that I will see Brandon free from his addiction one day and see Bryce graduate college.

Understanding came suddenly and would not be denied.
 I scoffed at myself humorlessly as my words taunted me—just harmless fun… what could it hurt?
 For half a second, I wanted to scream.
 And then my hands found their way to my stomach and rested there.
 I drew in a sharp intake of breath.
 I hadn’t noticed I had gotten so deeply involved in the story.
 I needed to rest, to finish my recovery and break the bonds.
 But I couldn’t seem to step away.
 I was unnaturally calm when they finally came for me.
 I knew they would recognize the signs.

Sometimes no matter what a person does as a parent, children may travel to dangerous places.
 Some will return from those places unharmed and some may never return.
 A family can look perfect from the outside but be quite the opposite on the inside.
 I have lived such a life.
 I do not know what made me do what I did for my son but I can only surmise that it was a combination of all of the defining moments in my life that lead me to where I am today.

It is the only way you can learn to respond quickly.
 You need to get past that block, to use your defense as instinct.” I really didn’t want to play anymore.
 But before I could protest, a black rock hurtled toward me.
 My hand jerked up automatically to swat it away but my arm hit an invisible wall.
 The rock slammed into my face.
 I was fairly certain my nose was bleeding from the impact.
 I tried to slow my horse but no longer had control of him.
 “Again,” Chevelle warned.
 The rock was coming for me a second time.
 I tried to duck out of the way but the wall was there once more, blocking me from moving.

“Emily, knock it off balance.” “Can I skip while I do it?” Emily asked.
 He gritted his teeth.
 “Fine.” He turned to me.
 “Jazell, you’ll aim for the belly while we hold it off.
 If you can’t get an arrow in before I can cut off the stinger, then I’ll have to do it myself.” “Fine boss dude,” I said with a snort.
 Seth ducked and charged the creature, his sword held out behind him.
 Jason flicked some knives into his wrist and flung them at the creature.
 Some hit their mark, which was signaled by the creature roaring out in pain, others fell into the dirt.
 Emily danced close to it, spinning fire from her fingertips.
 The creature raised a leg and swatted at her but she just twirled away.

A couple of hours later at lunch, Mrs. Campbell had met the appearance of Rachel, Alec, and the rest of the pack with a raised eyebrow and a disbelieving headshake, but simply motioned them all over to the other side of the room, and handed me my test.
 Despite having spent weeks preparing for my makeup exam, I was still a little nervous until I started working the first problem.
 Forty minutes later I handed Mrs. Campbell a completed test, and got the extreme pleasure of watching her grade it and write a large, crimson 'A' on the front page.
 I was so excited I nearly squealed in delight.
 I managed to restrain myself, just barely, only to giggle as Rachel dropped her lunch and squealed for me.
 Dominic's gentle smile wasn't quite as enthusiastic, but I already knew her subdued reaction wasn't any less heartfelt.
 Throw in Jasmin's congratulations, which seemed to indicate the passing grade had been nothing less than inevitable, with Alec taking my hand as soon as I sat down, and Jessica and James' lack of response didn't matter at all.
 With Isaac's reassuring presence at my side in History, I weathered the renewed gossip, apparently occasioned by the entire pack's absence during lunch for the second day in a row, and soon found myself reunited with Alec in Physics.
 As luck would have it, Mrs. Alexander was gone again, and the substitute was typically clueless about what we were supposed to be doing.
 Alec of course spent the whole class unearthing other little bits of embarrassing information.

 there was this other type of picture.
 One woman was expecting a baby and didn't know whether her husband or her father-in-law was the father!
 Another man was on trial for the murder of his sister's beau, and a woman had been kidnapped--" "A soap opera."
 He dropped onto the sofa beside her.
 "Those programs are designed to appeal to our baser instincts.
 They're sensationalistic.
 I'll get you some old movies to watch."
 "Get me some?"
 "Yeah--we'll rent some."

I should have talked to him about it a few years ago.
 Kids grow ups so damn fast, and there’s never enough time.
 Eugene – I think I have it.
 Art – Alright let’s have it then.
 Eugene – Art, will you adopt me as your own?
 Art –Uh?
 Eugene – I asked if you would adopt me into the family.
 Art – I heard you, I was just a bit surprised by the request.
 I was expecting that you would need me to testify for your character.
 Besides we’ve pretty much adopted you already.

Emily glared at him, “You deserved it because you soaked us too.” “So,” he rolled his eyes, “you thought you could just ambush us.
 Have you learned nothing and that we might want revenge now.
 Then you will and so on.
 You’ve started a really long war.” “Who says the penguins can’t win a war, huh?
 We just won right now,” Emily said.
 “The penguins?” “Does that really matter?” she hissed.
 “You’re on.” Jason smirked, “Alright then, penguins, if you want a water war, you got one.” “You’re on too!” This whole time Seth didn’t say a word, which was strange.
 Usually Seth did all the talking while Jason stood watching but now Jason was doing all the talking and Seth was the one watching.
 He stood there and seemed unmoved from being soaked by my water gun.
 His face was blank and he was staring at nothing.

Rodregas did not stop snapping it until he had the man’s face looking into the rock below.
 The three sat there for a minute and then stepped away to rest against the far wall to get some distance from Van’dret’s body.
 After a few minutes Doi’van said, “Well, one more Immortalist down, that’s good.” The other two nodded.
 Rodregas said, “We did not learn much more though.
 We still don’t really understand why they are interested in Infernal power now and willing to break The One Law.” “You mean if that is what they are doing.
 We really don’t know for sure, other than for Ravenhurr,” said Imeralda.
 Doi’van, sounding like granite, said, “I know Taiga is involved.” The other two nodded, but did not pursue that thought.
 Rodregas then said, “I agree we are just starting to figure out that there is something big going on.
 I can’t believe even the Immortalists would be crazy enough to go up against both the Celestial Gods and the Daemon Lordsof the Infernal though.” Imeralda nodded and said, “What price is so high as to be even better than God hood?” The three sat silent for a few minutes soaking in that question.
 Rodregas looked at Imeralda and asked, “Well, we can’t answer that today, but how did you break Van’dret’s spell?” Imeralda nodded and with a smile said, “I always hoped that if I had to take on a sorcerer it would be in the Forest where I would have an edge, but no, it had to be in a hallway!

Therefore, upgrading productivity, skills and incomes in this sector is the single most effective means of improving the livelihood of women in developing countries.
 Skill development programmes in areas such as hybrid seed production, floriculture, inland aquaculture, vegetables and poultry can be particularly beneficial.
 Promotion of micro-level credit institutions and savings programmes can generate capital for the establishment by women of small rural enterprises.
 FOOD SECURITY IN AFRICA
 The present prognosis for Africa resembles the pessimistic assessment of Asia in the 1960s that projected most Asians would face starvation in the 1970s.
 Over the past two decades, total food production in Africa has grown at exactly the same rate as for the world as a whole, but high levels of population growth have resulted in declining availability of food per capita in many countries, particularly in the sub-Saharan region.
 This suggests that a grim outcome is not inevitable, if concerted action is taken now.
 Several factors have impeded achievement of higher agricultural growth rates in the region: political instability and civil unrest, poor macro-economic and agricultural policies, drought, and physical difficulties in farming in some areas.
 The ravages of war have had the most devastating effect, but inadequate and counter-productive policies have also had a major impact.
 Low mandated prices for agricultural products have acted as a disincentive to producers.

Partly, it could come from bank commercial loans against commodity collateral, loans from regional development banks, the World Bank and IMF's Buffer Stock Facility, which has remained almost unused.
 8.Technology transfer: Accelerate transfer of technology to and between developing countries.
 One or more profit-making commercial organizations should be established as a public sector joint venture of developing countries to promote the commercial transfer of technology to, within and between developing countries and to channel the profits from this activity toward research in these countries.
 9.Global employment model: Our efforts to promote employment are constrained by a lack of detailed knowledge of how global labour markets actually work.
 We still do not understand the impact of technology, trade, macro-economic policies, multinational corporations, shifting patterns of foreign investment and many other factors on job creation, and our ignorance severely hampers effective policy formulation and coordination.
 An international research programme should be organized under the ILO to construct a truly global employment model that monitors the impact of technological developments, expanding world trade, plant closings, movement of industry to low-wage countries, agriculture-led industrialization, economic growth, immigration policies, refugee movements and other factors affecting employment opportunities around the world.
 10.Shift focus of technological development: The number of jobs created or destroyed by technology depends on the priority given to various objectives in the process of technological development.
 Presently, there is an in-built bias in technological R & D towards replacing human labour with capital and energy, even when similar levels of quality and efficiency could be achieved by alternative means.
 A conscious shift of focus could lead to the development of more labour-intensive production processes.
 The production of more food to meet the needs of a burgeoning population has been one of the outstanding global achievements of the post-war period.

I don't want to lose you."
 When he didn't get a response, he turned toward the stairs with a sigh.
 He'd known exactly what he was doing when he'd kissed her, and he'd known it was unfair.
 He couldn't blame her for being angry.
 Marie wanted to throw something.
 Or hit something.
 She settled for snatching up her pillow and slamming it against the bedpost.
 She was confused enough already--she didn't need him making everything worse.
 She loved her family and missed them.
 But she also loved Rick.

I grabbed my bow and shot him with an arrow before he his little legs could he him very far.
 He fell to the ground, the arrow sticking straight up at the sky.
 Now the forest was maniac free.
 I killed the others and looked up to find the thrashers dead too, probably courtesy of Seth.
 A few dwarfs were also lying dead in front of Emily.
 I walked back to my body and closed my eyes.
 When I reopened them, I stood, stretching my legs.
 The four of us headed back to the restaurant together, adrenaline still pumping through my veins.
 I told Emily and the boys about the freaky dwarves.
 “Crazy right?” I asked, running a hand through my hair.

His behavior was erratic and unpredictable.
 I just didn’t understand why he kept repeating the same destructive behavior.
 Now I had the same question regarding my son.
 I couldn’t help either of them.
 I had pretty much given up on Thomas, and I was afraid to give up on Brandon.
 Over the years, Thomas had conned me out of thousands of dollars.
 He had an uncanny ability to put together some huge deal making himself absurd amounts of money and then blowing it all on a high roller lifestyle followed by being completely broke and desperate and addicted to drugs again and again.
 Thomas had also conned or borrowed thousands of dollars from mutual friends and associates, and it was not uncommon for my wife and me to be confronted by angry people in restaurants or public places because my brother owed them money.
 The last straw with Thomas was over Christmas many years back when he became so violent and threatening that Lisa and I decided to not see him or his family again.
 We even told our children that if Uncle Thomas came to our house or ever tried to get them in a car that they were to run to any other adult.

People my age don't really do sympathy very well.
 We're much more inclined towards ridicule and hasty, usually unfair, judgments.
 Still, something had changed.
 I held onto that hope right up until I saw Mrs. Sorenson joining everyone else in staring at me whenever I looked down at my book.
 There was no mistaking the look on her face; it was utter distaste, possibly with a dash of disdain.
 I was so tired of it all.
 By the time English rolled around my natural embarrassment had given way to actual anger at Britney for starting it all.
 She tried to catch me at our lockers in between classes, but I pretended not to hear her, and made it safely into Mr. Whethers' class before she could catch up.
 Part of me acknowledged how petty it was, but I avoided her attempts at a whispered conversation during class.
 Mr. Whethers unknowingly helped my cause, when he crossly silenced a couple of girls on the far side of the classroom.

Regardless, I made my way over and took a few volumes and scrolls back to my secluded table.
 I was able to find several documents on the northern clans and even one of the missing pages of names—L.
 I had spread them out on the table and was studiously examining them when a shadow crossed my desk.
 I realized someone was standing there and distractedly glanced up to see who.
 My instinct to breathe deserted me.
 It was Chevelle Vattier.
 Chapter Three Black Roots
 Chevelle stood there, staring down at me, as I leaned halfway across the table of documents concerning the northern clans.
 Researching him.
 I tried not to betray myself by glancing down at the papers, but the only other place to look was into his eyes, and it felt like that was all I’d found myself doing since I’d first seen him.

“What’s that?”
 The half-orc shook his head.
 “Not now.

 The two grew quiet, and they stared at the fire as the time passed.
 At last, when Harruq was sure Qurrah would not bring up the subject, he spoke.
 “About the guards,” he said.
 “You think they’re telling the truth?”
 Qurrah glanced up.
 “About the elven blood in us?”

 “And I will bring order.”

His voice dropped to a rumbling whisper.
 "The one I told you about the other day."
 It was incredibly obvious, all the while making absolutely no sense.
 He was obviously uncomfortable this morning, just like you'd expect from someone who was in the unenviable position of telling off a borderline psychopath.
 Everything I'd seen substantiated Brandon's explanation, but why would Jasmin become so enamored of someone so average-looking?
 Not only that, what were the odds Ben was one of the eight males in America who would decide they weren't interested in dating the most gorgeous girl on the planet, even if she was a nut case?
 I was still trying to sort out all the pieces when Brandon fished his cell phone out of a pocket and checked the time.
 In an amazing display of herd behavior, thirty seconds later his friends had all disappeared, and he was standing to leave.
 "We should do this more often.
 I'll see you tomorrow."

I wished my son was here to see what could have been.
 The audience in the courtroom was a colorful mixture of society’s misfits and their families.
 Again I found myself hoping nobody would recognize me or my son’s name plastered for all to see on the hearings notice sheet attached to the courtroom door.
 These fatherly duties seemed minimal after what I had already done and I was happy to do this because he was getting the help he needed.
 I was still humiliated to be there and to see my last name on the court docket clipboard.
 Easter weekend, Lisa, Bryce and I drove over eight hours drive towards Temecula, California, then over a rural road through a desert valley to Werner Springs.
 There was no mistaking our destination when we spotted it.
 It looked like the recreation yard in the film One Flew Over the Coo Coo’s Nest, as people milled about, stopping and turning to look at us as we entered the parking lot.
 The facility itself might have been a roadside migrant worker motel.
 People were roaming around the grounds doing everything from raking leaves to just hanging in groups, but each one stopped what they were doing to examine us as we drove in.

Liz – Ah yeah, yes, that’s it.
 Ten Midgets didja say?
 I’m going with the angry gang of midgets wielding the pointed sticks they have the numbers and pointed sticks.
 Jim – There doesn’t need to be a lot of dwarves, just one of them is worth like 3 midgets, pointed sticks or no pointed sticks.
 What they lack in quantity they make up in quality.
 I mean these guys are huge and muscular, at least from a midget’s perspective, and they have those pick-axes they use around the mine.
 The seven dwarves would win hands down.
 Liz – you’re forgetting that the dwarves have just come home after a long day’s work in the mines.
 They’re exhausted, they’re not looking for a fight.
 They don’t have a prayer of taking on all 10 of the midgets.

He was Grand Council.
 I studied the other newcomer, who acted as if I wasn’t present.
 He was incredulous, staring at Chevelle when he spoke.
 “Her mother slaughtered your clan, your family.
 Why release this terror—” The man’s words were cut short, his face contorted in pain.
 Chevelle had gone rigid, every muscle tense.
 The councilman struggled, suffering from some unseen force.
 Blood poured from his nose and I gasped.
 Chevelle’s head jerked toward me and I couldn’t catch my breath—his eyes were as black as onyx.
 When his focus returned to the men, they eased away, the first supporting other by an arm as both bowed slightly, stepping and stumbling in their retreat.

"Darling, I'm sorry.
 Please come out for a minute."
 She went to open the door.
 "You hurt my feelings.
 And you hurt my arm."
 "I'm sorry.
 I'm under a lot of pressure at work, and I took it out on you."
 He took her hand and raised her arm so that he could kiss it where he'd squeezed it.

"That's a good point, but you can't blame me for being worried, sweetie.
 I mean with this new boyfriend of yours.
 You know I don't trust boys who drive sports cars.
 Especially not the really cute ones who have a way of making every female in sight go all gooey on the inside."
 She slid the window shut with a sigh, rather than screaming in shock, so Alec wasn't lying on the ground with a pair of broken legs.
 Apparently Brandon's charms were enough to make Mom forget herself while he was around, but not so great as to keep her from worrying when he wasn't.
 I shrugged uncomfortably.
 "He's not my boyfriend, Mom.
 I mean he wasn't really ever my boyfriend, but even less so now."
 Mom looked away from the skyline, a new batch of concern painted across her features.

“Are you hurt?” “No.” He glanced at my hands, wrapped tightly around the neck of the container, and then back at me.
 “Do you know who I am?” Something about that was funny and I laughed, but it came out hoarse.
 He looked torn as he posed the next question, tentative.
 “Can you tell me your name?” I wondered how bad I was messed up for him to approach me with this line of questioning.
 “Frey.” “Your full name?” I rolled my eyes, and then wished I hadn’t as the room spun.
 I pressed a hand to my temple, reciting, “Elfreda Georgiana Suzetta Glaforia.” They all drew in a deep breath.
 “What?” Chevelle’s sigh seemed to have let the air out of him.
 His fingers rested on the edge of the cloak beneath me.
 “Are you in pain?” “No.
 Not anymore.” He nodded.

I felt my eyes go wide at the idea of something so unbelievable happening to us, and then even wider as I realized this must be what Alec had been referring to.
 'Convince her it's fine for her to leave' indeed.
 He hadn't been kidding about getting us out of the country.
 "Mom, you have to go!
 This is the biggest opportunity ever!"
 She looked doubtful.
 "Sweetie, I know it seems exciting, and heaven knows we could use the money, but that just isn't my kind of thing."
 I shrugged.
 "Yeah, but once you've had some paying photography jobs it's sure to help land others.
 It isn't your ideal kind of work, but it's still a good start, and you never know where it might lead."

Why was it that you quit being a biker?
 Eugene – Bikers aren’t evil enough to suit me, they’re just mean and sometimes stinky.
 So can we get back to finding a new name?
 Liz – They must have beaten him up.
 Jim – They didn’t like you pretending to be a biker did they?
 Eugene – No, they didn’t seem to, so they asked me to stop.
 Jim – And you did?
 They asked you to stop and you did?
 Why didn’t I think of that?
 Eugene – There were eight large hairy men, and they had knives and clubs.

I almost took a step back when he turned towards me.
 "I realize it's unreasonable to ask you to trust me right now, but I'm going to need you to do so.
 Can you remain quiet for the next few minutes?"
 I wanted to ask why, but it was obvious we didn't have the time for a lengthy explanation.
 I nodded.
 "I trust you.
 After everything you've done, I know you wouldn't hurt me."
 Alec turned towards Rachel, but she shook her head before he could even open his mouth.
 "You don't even need to ask.
 I'll follow your lead, and try to look brave."

"You're different from the others then?
 I mean, they can't change into cats, can they?"
 She shook her head, attention still mostly on the fighting taking place on the far end of the sand court.
 "We're from different bloodlines.
 If you believe the legends, Adjam became the first wolf, and Inock the first of the big cats.
 Alec and the others descended from Adjam, and I'm a descendant of Inock."
 It all seemed so impossible, legends brought to life and paraded before my incredulous eyes, and yet there was no arguing with the truth.
 It was starting to sink in that I needed to come to terms with all of the natural implications.
 Things like the fact that some or all of my attraction to Alec was based on his ability to addict humans to him, intentionally or not.
 James and Jessica were squared off against Alec now while Isaac and Jasmin watched.

 "Do you have a television?"

 She jumped when the microwave beeped.

 He extended the bowl, and she touched the food.
 It was hot.

"And it's accepted?
 In 1927, women can go to speakeasies, but not respectable women."
 "We don't have speakeasies like those in the '20s, but if you want to, I'll take you dancing one night.
 To one of the wild places where the kids go if you like--and you'll still be considered respectable."
 They spent the next hour comparing their respective decades.
 She told him all about her favorite stars and pictures.
 She'd known one of the eight contestants in the first Miss America contest in 1921, and she'd followed the Scopes trial in 1925 with shocked fascination.
 He told her that all 50 states--"Fifty!"
 she exclaimed--had Miss America representatives in a contest that was televised every year, along with a Miss Universe contest, and that evolution was taught in most schools now, alongside creation in some parts of the country.
 She told him that she'd always wanted to see Josephine Baker's stage show and Louis Armstrong and his trumpet, and he told her that anyone truly talented and/or popular now eventually did a television special.

And you will promise that in the name of the All-Father, or you will die at my hand.” Rodregas did not smile now, nor did they.
 “So you think you could kill all of us?
 Put your sword down now!” demanded Audrian.
 Rodregas stepped forward and buried just the tip of his right-handed short sword into Audrian’s chest, hitting the ribs but not shoving the blade through.
 Audrian gasped in surprise and fell back.
 “Swear you will keep my secret and you live, do not and you die.
 Choose!” Audrian just stood there looking at him.
 Then he nodded and said, “In the name of the All-Father, Lord of Sky and Earth and Water, I swear that I will keep your secrets.” Rodregas nodded and relaxed slightly; few would dare break a promise to the All-Father.
 Rodregas decided that Brit and Geor were like pale shadows as they quickly followed suit.
 When he turned to the last two he saw that they were very interested in what he was saying.

Rick Newman."
 "This must be strange for you as well."
 "You can't imagine."
 "I think I can."
 She raised the visor.
 "Can we go to the library now?"
 If this wasn't her home, she was going to find a way to get back.
 CHAPTER FOUR
 Marie sat beside Rick at the library, watching in amazement as titles of books and magazines appeared on a screen in front of him.
 Whenever he found something that he thought could help them, a machine in front of her would print the title and its number on a piece of paper.

The symbols on his body faded until they were but faint scars.
 “Give him his clothes,” Velixar ordered his student.
 Qurrah fetched a pair of black pants, a red shirt, and a black cloak, all of which Velixar had prepared before the brothers had brought the bloodless body to him.
 “Dress,” the necromancer ordered.
 Ahrqur growled some inane argument, but a glare from Velixar sent him cowering.
 “You must obey my every command, wretch, before you may return to the peaceful death you left.
 Fight me and you shall find your stay here lasting longer than your rotting body’s.”
 The undead Ahrqur whimpered.
 Qurrah watched the display, fighting against feelings of jealousy.
 He had commanded Ahrqur’s spirit to speak truthfully, but Velixar’s very glare sent him groveling to his knees.

“Antonil…‌something more is at work here.
 Be wary.
 I will not take sides in this conflict, and neither shall the Quellan elves, but if I find who caused this war, I will kill him.
 It is the least I can do.”
 A great beat of white wings and then the elf was in the air.
 Antonil watched him fly far south, watched until he was a tiny white dot among a blanket of stars.
 Before he stopped watching, however, he saw more than fifty similar white dots line the horizon.
 The guard captain smiled, somehow heartened by the sight.
 “Let us hope for miracles,” he whispered to the night.
 “And let us hope that at tomorrow’s end all my troops are still alive.”

We killed our own dad, and never even knew it while we did.”
 She frowned, and deep lines of exhaustion marred her beauty.
 “Tonight we need to have a serious talk,” she said.
 “For now, I’d prefer we speak of lighter things.”
 “Sure thing,” he said.
 They spoke no word of Woodhaven, Velixar, or the battle that morning for the rest of the day.

 The sound of an opening door stirred him from his slumber.
 Qurrah glanced around, furious that he had fallen asleep.

A thistle growing in Evelyn’s throat, slowly choking off her airway.
 Chevelle’s face when he had asked who had showed me to fuse the crystal with blood.
 His expression as he’d looked down at me the night before.
 How could you not know?
 That image haunted me the most.
 It seemed familiar somehow.
 He’d let his guard down, and though strained with worry and fear, there was something else there, sadness or maybe just plain sympathy.
 “This is a good place to stop for the night,” Chevelle said, breaking my trance.
 I’d barely noticed the day pass.
 A glance at the path behind us showed the lake far in the distance below.

I hadn’t put much planning in this, but I was still running on adrenaline.
 I decided the fastest course of action was pecking his eyes out.
 It worked.
 He threw his hands up, covering his face, screaming.
 But he did not attack me.
 As I rose back to find my next target, I saw the wolves.
 They were also not being attacked, fighting with no opposition.
 And then I remembered what Chevelle had said.
 They would not kill the animals.
 As I laughed, the hawk screeched, and Chevelle and Steed glanced up at the sound.

Salvation took a throat.
 Condemnation pierced rib and lung.
 Harruq ripped his blade out of the guard’s chest and shoved the body to the side.
 The dying heap of flesh collided against two other men, knocking them back and delaying their attack.
 He mocked them, adrenaline flooding his veins.
 “Is that all you can do?” he screamed.
 “Where’s the fun in this?”
 “Here’s your fun,” one said, stabbing at Harruq’s side from behind.
 The blade punctured the black armor and bit into flesh.
 The half-orc roared, and then twisted so fast it left the expert guard breathless.

It was Chevelle Vattier.
 Chapter Three Black Roots
 Chevelle stood there, staring down at me, as I leaned halfway across the table of documents concerning the northern clans.
 Researching him.
 I tried not to betray myself by glancing down at the papers, but the only other place to look was into his eyes, and it felt like that was all I’d found myself doing since I’d first seen him.
 He didn’t look away.
 I had no way of knowing if he’d read the documents before I realized he was there, and I stared at him, frozen for what seemed like an eternity.
 But I was unable to decipher his expression, or guess how I should explain having the documents.
 Words abandoned me when I opened my mouth to speak.
 He finally broke the silence.

That your kisses make me hot, she thought.
 That your warmth and tenderness and thoughtfulness have made me dissatisfied with the man I'm supposed to marry.
 That I feel more comfortable with you than I could ever hope to feel with Davis.
 Rick watched the emotions play across her face.
 "What isn't my fault?"
 he repeated, his forefinger tracing a path along her throat up to her chin.
 She swallowed.
 "That-that I can't go through with it."
 His finger froze.
 "I'm sorry--I should never have pushed you.

“I lied.” I blinked in amazement.
 “You lied to Emily?
 She’s going kill you.” He smiled faintly.
 “She doesn’t need to know.” “So a dwarf told you something?
 Why didn’t you tell us?” I asked.
 Seth looked away.
 “It didn’t actually include you or anyone else, so I didn't say anything.” He paused.
 “They said that I would betray you all and be Kojas' servant.
 I would be the key to the downfall of Igneeria.
 I don't know what to do Jazell; I don't even know if those things are true.

Please kiss me again."
 His groan was deeper this time, and he turned away from her, dropping his head into his hands.
 "Please go to bed, Marie."
 "But Rick--" "Just go to bed.
 Please."
 He didn't look up when she finally complied.
 He'd never known such ecstatic misery.
 He wanted her so much that, 20 minutes after she'd gone, his hands were still trembling.
 Was he a fool?
 She'd begged him to keep kissing her.

While foreign aid to developing countries as a percentage of GDP has fallen by 50 per cent since 1990, it has been offset to some extent by a 150 per cent rise in foreign investment.
 In the least developed countries, foreign aid has declined by 24 per cent but this has been offset by a 29-fold increase in foreign investment, so that the combination of foreign aid and foreign investment as a percentage of GDP has remained constant.
 If the rich countries, particularly USA, had met the UN development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of GDP, progress in improving the human condition in countries characterized by a high incidence of poverty would have been faster.
 These real and significant gains have been offset and to a large extent obscured in our minds by the persistence and aggravation of problems that constitute the other side of the post-Cold War ledger.
 Far from vanishing, the nuclear danger has been aggravated by the continued proliferation of nuclear weapons, the increasing danger of these weapons falling into the hands of terrorists, and the stubborn refusal of the existing nuclear powers to seize the opportunity to totally eradicate this pernicious arsenal of self-annihilation.
 Reduced confrontation between nation states has been followed by an aggravation of internal conflicts within countries as well as a dramatic increase in threats of violence by disenchanted minorities.
 Violent local conflicts continue to flare around the world.
 Terrorist acts have intensified against civilian populations on every continent.
 While the worst fears about rising unemployment in the West have been dispelled, the challenge of generating sufficient employment opportunities for all people around the world remains a pressing concern.
 The rich-poor divide has increased within and between nations.

Harruq had no reply.
 Eyes low, he stepped out into the night, Aurelia trailing not far behind.
 They travelled deeper into the town.
 A knot grew in her stomach as she noticed he had both his swords, and as they approached the poorer parts of the town, the knot only tightened.
 She watched the half-orc glance in through the windows of the buildings he passed.
 She found herself praying he only meant to steal possessions…‌just possessions, nothing more.
 _Keep the swords sheathed,_ she prayed.
 _Sheathed and bloodless._
 He continued wandering, and she found herself circling several streets multiple times.
 Stalling, she thought, but it was little comfort.

To my shock, the recording on Ashley’s phone stated it was no longer in service.

At the top of the hill, Emily and Jason were waiting for us.
 A shadow formed behind them and I screamed for them to turn around.
 “What the heck?” Seth shouted and pointed.
 Oh snap.
 Chapter 10
 Emily and Jason dashed back to our sides as the shadow became a body.
 It was bigger than the dragon we had rode.
 It had the body of a huge cockroach but its tail was a giant stinger.
 Large, bat wings were holding it up in the air.
 “What is it?” I asked.

"I don't know what you're going to do, but maybe you shouldn't get up yet."
 I looked over at Rachel's concerned face and opened my mouth to thank her for whispering, for keeping my secret, only the words didn't come out.
 Instead the image of Alec, the one that had burned itself onto my retinas a few seconds previously just as it had done in physics when I'd looked over to see his broken pencil, flared back into life before my eyes.
 "You knew there was another time.
 Alec told you about Physics."
 Rachel opened her mouth, probably to deny it, but the look in her eyes told me it was true.
 She couldn't possibly be that scared about me putting two and two together if he'd been saying nice things about me.
 He hated me, and she was scared of him, scared of what he'd do if he found out she'd let his secret slip.
 "It's not like that, Adri.
 It's..." I didn't even have to cut her off.

This requires a fundamental shift in perspective, a new vision of global security.
 Clearly, the competitive security paradigm cannot provide a stable basis for global peace and security.
 A significant reduction in global military expenditure is a welcome development.
 Reducing the quantity and des tructive power of weapons arsenals will certainly reduce the actual and perceived risks of conflict.
 But, at the same time, a tendency is emerging to perpetuate the ‘we–they’ syndrome of competitive security by shifting the axis from East–West to North–South.
 This has resulted in increasing pressure on developing countries by multilateral and bilateral aid agencies seeking to bring down military expenditure among aid-dependent countries even further.
 In doing so, it ignores the right and responsibility of these nations to provide for their own legitimate security needs at a time when no alternative mechanism exists at the international level to ensure the inviolability of their borders.
 There is truth in the claim that military spending by developing countries has increased dramatically during the past 30 years.
 This increase is partially explained by the fact that more than 100 new sovereign nations have emerged, many of which were protected, prior to independence, by the colonial powers that have now withdrawn.
 The acquisition of even modest defensive capabilities may consume a significant portion of national income when the economic base is small, as it is for many of these nations.

I couldn’t believe he’d fooled me again.
 I didn’t care what else they had to say.
 I stood and marched away, fuming at the idea that both of them were in on it.
 They might have been council, but it didn’t stop the feeling of betrayal.
 They’d lied to me, acted as if they’d cared.
 I was done with them.
 With everyone.
 I wanted as far away from all of it as possible.
 But I didn’t make it far.
 Exhaustion caught up with me a few miles later and I found an old oak tree, sliding down its massive trunk to rest my aching legs.

 "Yeah."

Shame and embarrassment burned in Harruq’s cheeks.
 He towered over his brother, his hands beefy and arms muscular.
 Nothing should scare him.
 He was supposed to be Qurrah’s protector, not the other way around.
 “Where can we climb?” Harruq asked, hoping to get his mind off the skulls.
 “There,” Qurrah pointed.
 A narrow set of stairs climbed to the parapet and Harruq led the way.
 The city gates were lost in the distance, city guards clustered about them.
 “Look,” Harruq said.
 “Orcs.”

I missed Davis when I first came here, and I never felt for him like--" "Marie."
 He pulled her into his arms, hugging her tightly.
 "I don't want to cause you pain.
 But I can't help it that I love you.
 And that I want you to stay here with me."
 Her body shook with sobs.
 Rick scooped her up and sat down with her on his lap.
 "Please don't cry, sweetheart," he pleaded, kissing her hair.
 He opened his mouth to tell her that she might not even be able to get back, since she'd been unsuccessful so far.
 But that would just hurt her more.

Harruq turned a new shade of red.
 “Well, I’d look weird walking down the street with those flowers in hand.
 I do have a reputation to keep.”
 The elf laughed.
 “Thank you, Harruq.
 Are you ready to begin?”
 He nodded, eager to have the awkwardness pass.
 Aurelia twirled the staff in her hands as her smile faded into seriousness.
 Harruq drew his swords, and then they sparred.

"You have a good point."
 As soon as he'd pulled out of the driveway, he took her hand.
 "Did you have a good time tonight?"
 "Mmm."
 She leaned over and kissed his cheek.
 Rick was glad that the trip home was long enough to give him a chance to cool down.
 If they'd been alone at home instead of leaning against his car in his sister's driveway, he would have had a hard time stopping.
 So when they got home and Marie put her arms around his neck, obviously ready to pick up where they'd left off, he held her away.
 "We need to talk about this."
 She kissed his chin.

Rodregas swore that as soon as he looked at the cats, they were already looking at him straight in the eye.
 The large green eyes demanded something of him even as the animals lay in apparent complete relaxation, sprawled on the stone floor.
 He had to let them out, but how was he going to do that?
 If he simply opened the door, they might tear him apart.
 Rodregas thought the cats may also attack the guard at the front gate on their way out.
 He looked around and realized that the other side of the hall had a door that opened in the same direction as the door leading to the cage.
 He opened it up and thought that if he opened the Dire Cats’ door, he could block them from this direction, while keeping himself safe behind the two doors.
 He knew the guards at the gate would be incredibly curious about what he had been doing, but they would not actually do anything to challenge the man they thought was the Sorcerer Ravenhurr.
 He also knew that he would have to get them out of the way of the Dire Cats.
 At least that way he could also claim the black yew recurve bows.

“What are they looking at?” Harruq later asked as the two brothers walked down the winding streets of Woodhaven.
 “Let us see,” said Qurrah.
 Harruq muscled his way past two men, his brother following in his wake.
 They found a proclamation nailed to a post.
 “What’s it say?” Harruq asked.
 “All children are to be kept outside the boundary of the forest,” Qurrah said, his eyes narrowing.
 “Six have been killed by the…”
 Qurrah laughed, a hideous sound.
 “By the what?” Harruq asked.
 “The Forest Butcher,” said an aged woman next to him, her voice creaking as if she had tiny pebbles lodged in her throat.

Rodregas started to explain, “Forms are a series of motions that mock fighting, but also give you an opportunity to work on balance and to visualize and understand your actions and responses to different fighting situations.
 While strength and speed are important for any kind of fighting whether it is hand-to-hand or swords fighting, good technique is all about balance and center of gravity.
 What you want to learn is to keep your center low and your balance strong even when you are tired and exhausted.” Doi’van had his normal interested expression, but Imeralda looked unconvinced.
 “Ok,” he said, “time for an example.
 Imeralda stand tall,” Rodregas stated.
 She put her shoulders back, which caused her firm, rounded breast’s to thrust out.
 Rodregas didn’t think she meant the gesture to be sexual, but he hesitated at the sight of her superbly shaped body.
 Rodregas ignored his own rush of hormones and pushed her high on the shoulder and she stumbled back.
 “Now,” he said, “lower your center of gravity.
 Bend your legs, but keep them loose.” She followed his instructions, and he thought this would make her look less striking, but she went from a statuesque dancer to a crouching feline.

“Harruq, I need you.
 Where are you?”
 Then he heard talking and shut his mouth.
 “Are you alright, Dieredon?” an elf asked.
 The scoutmaster nodded, leaning heavily on his bow.
 “I will be fine.
 His magic left my body upon his death.”
 A neigh brought his attention upward.
 Sonowin landed next to him, her white hair stained red in places.
 She nuzzled the elf and snorted something.

He was devastated to see the condition of his property but he was strangely calm and understanding.
 He simply wanted our help to get Brandon’s belongings out of his house and fix things as best we could.
 He gave us an offer we couldn’t refuse.
 If we would get everything out by the evening and pull out all of the carpet, he would not pursue damages.
 None of us were prepared for what we saw when we turned the key in the lock and opened the door.
 Paper and cardboard blackened the windows.
 When we removed these window covers, we found broken panes behind them.
 The bedroom doors had been kicked in, and broken bongs and stem pipes, empty cigarette packs, matchbooks, just trash littered every surface.
 I don’t know what the hell these people (my son!)
 did in here, but the carpet could not have been dirtier if they raised farm animals indoors.

He wanted to beg her to stay with him, to get down on his knees if he had to, cry, plead.
 But that would just make both of them miserable.
 She'd already made her decision.
 He led her into the garden.
 "I'll sit here and think about your life in 1927.
 I think if you just walk straight out that way, you'll get home."
 She linked her arms around his neck, still clutching the paper bag.
 "I love you with all my heart, Rick.
 This is tearing me apart.
 I want to spend my life with you.

“The Great Oath of Fealty for one of Infernal birth?
 I would see that.” He turned to Doi’van who loomed over all of them.
 Doi’van had watched the show with a cold interest.
 The sorcerer spoke with a command that dripped venom, “On your knees Hellborn and swear the oath of fealty, in the name of the All-Father to this squire where we can all see.” Doi’van paused for a heartbeat and then pulled his sword out in a smooth gesture and for a moment Rodregas was thinking that a battle was to be had, but then Doi’van dropped to his knees in front of Rodregas.
 He took the sword onto his arms as if in morning sword meditation and spoke the words of the Oath.
 “By my mortal blood and sweat and tears do I swear my fealty to the Squire Rodregas in the name of the Father of Ocean, Sky and Earth.” Rodregas nodded and responded as was required, “As the All-Father protects and guards his people so do I swear to do my best to live up to your oath in the Name of the All-Father.” Rodregas reached down and picked up the sword across Doi’van’s arms and lifted it up.
 “As I lift your sword up, so do I lift up your honor and make it mine.” As he finished the oath he handed the sword back to Doi’van, who responded with the final, “My arm shall be your arm, my sword your sword, my honor your honor.” Rodregas had expected to have to claim his followers as Oath Bond, but a knight would never have demanded to see the oath.
 He felt guilt seize his stomach at having been mistaken and knowing Doi’van had been forced to swear the oath, due to not wanting to blow their cover.
 Rodregas swore to himself that he would lift the oath as soon as they could be free, but the fact that Doi’van had trusted him enough to say such an oath out loud, which could put his very soul in jeopardy, was a powerful statement to their growing friendship.
 Rodregas looked back at the sorcerer who actually seemed surprised at watching the oath sworn, “Satisfied, Sir?” The sorcerer waved his hand and without a word went back to his chair sitting down as a king to his throne.

She got so involved in the exercises and then exploring the house that she'd only watched one of the movies--"Gone with the Wind," which made her laugh sometimes and cry sometimes and held her spellbound the entire time--by 5:30, when Rick got home from work.
 “Would you like me to get you some more movies for tomorrow?” Rick asked Marie as they prepared dinner together.
 “I still have that other one to watch.
 ‘Casablanca.’”  She handed him the green peppers she’d just chopped.
 “What next?” “Mushrooms.”  He handed her a carton.
 Rick added some seasonings to the sauce he was stirring.
 Glancing at Marie, he saw that she had a mushroom on the cutting board but was just staring at it.
 “Is something wrong?” “What?” “You’re staring at that mushroom pretty intently.” “Oh.
 No—I was just thinking.”  She began slicing the mushroom.
 “About what?” Shaking her hair out of her face, she looked up at him.

Dieredon nodded.
 “I’ll find him and watch him for a bit.
 If either of them slaughters another child, I will see it and put an end to it.”
 Aurelia pulled a few strands of hair away from her mouth and tucked them behind her ear.
 “This seems like a small matter for a scoutmaster to be involved.
 Are you sure you have nothing more important to do?”
 “Murdered human children?” Dieredon shrugged.
 “Let the humans and orcs do as they wish, but when they butcher their young they must be made to suffer.
 You were right to contact me, Aurelia.”
 “I hope so,” Aurelia said.

“You were a worthy apprentice,” Velixar said.
 “Especially to learn such a spell on your own.
 Your master was blind.”
 “He was weakened,” Qurrah said.
 “Even the clumsiest of fighters can slay a sleeping man.”
 “How old were you then?” Velixar asked.
 “Nine,” Qurrah said.
 The man in black shook his head.
 His expression showed there would be no further argument.
 “If you had been mine at the age of nine…‌ my previous apprentice Xelrak held but a shred of your strength.”

My gut felt as if a big snake were coiled inside it.
 My heart was a huge lump of coal.
 I walked faster and groaned and wondered why I couldn’t weep.
 I thought of how Eric was ten times the human I would ever be.
 If he couldn’t become Superman, I estimated my chances equaled about the square root of zero.
 Mystery
 All these years, I have believed that in some vaguely Christ-like way, Eric died as a sacrifice.
 I reasoned like this: From at least two months away, he saw a big change approaching.
 As it neared, he apprehended it ever more clearly.
 Two weeks or so he had spent gathering his treasures and giving them away.

 But I'd still like you to have some dessert."
 He reached into his breast pocket.

 So this was the night!
 Wanting to prolong the moment as long as possible, she asked him, "What is it?"

Aurelia and Qurrah shared a quick, knowing smile.
 The frail half-orc’s face lost much of its lifelessness, and a gentle caring filled his eyes.
 His seriousness quickly buried it, but Aurelia had seen enough.
 “I shall leave you two to your studies and sparring,” Qurrah said after a long pause to torture Harruq.
 “Although I doubt the wisdom of leaving him alone with such a beautiful teacher.”
 “Good thing you will not have to worry about that, considering I see no beautiful teachers around,” Aurelia replied.
 Qurrah walked to Aurelia and bowed again, taking her hand in his and kissing it.
 As Aurelia smiled, he rose and whispered into her ear.
 “He loves you, elf.
 I can feel it.

I thought I could hear her whispering to someone in the apartment, but I only heard her voice.
 Now I was really wondering what I had walked in to.
 I labored to get my shoes off: A well placed moan and groan intended to prompt her curiosity.
 “Are you all right?” she asked, coming back into the room with a towel and spreading it flat onto the bed, then bending down and helping me untie my shoes.
 “I have back problems,” I said, standing to remove my dress shirt, exposing the back brace which I removed with angst.
 “Have your doctors given you anything for the pain?” she asked, helping my shirt off of each shoulder.
 I told her I had been given many medications, but I needed to be able to work my job so couldn’t take most of them.
 “I am a Financial Planner and I can’t afford to be loopy,” I said.
 “What kinds of stuff do they give you?” She pooched out her lower lip and tried to look more sad than excited.
 The conversation was headed quickly in the direction I had planned.

 “Why do you think Seth won’t tell us what he was doing?” I asked, watching her because she had refused to let me help.
 “Pride purposes?
 He was yelling at you when he broke his own rules.
 He just doesn’t want to admit he did” she said through her wild hair.
 Her lock finally clicked and she stood up.
 The boys were walking side by side towards the play set.
 It wasn’t actually that small but it looked that way from the street.
 There were six swings and a tower with four slides attached to it.
 I ran after them with Emily right behind me.

 Another thought came to him.

 He raced back to Woodhaven, his mind decided.
 It was time he had a talk with one of the brothers Tun.

 Harruq arrived at the sparring point in the forest less disheveled than the previous day, and he seemed in better spirits.
 “So what is your surprise for me?” he asked.

Actually, I couldn’t think of the last time the town had had trouble… She huffed and I knew it was best to indulge her.
 “What sort of trouble?” “Apparently, Evelyn of Rothegarr came into town from the meadows at full speed wheezing and sneezing.
 She reached the village center, grabbed her throat, and fell to the ground without a breath.
 Dying.” I stopped chewing, my mouth gone dry.
 Fannie continued, “They found a common thistle caught in her airway.” My stomach curled into knots.
 I whispered, “A thistle?” “Mmm.
 Council thinks she must have been working a spell that went awry.” Fannie peered at me; I might have turned pale.
 She threw the cork at me.
 Hard.
 I must have quit breathing because when I drew in a breath, it was sharp in my lungs.

 He could see a man cloaked in black standing upon a hill.

When I was about fourteen years old, I missed curfew, which I knew was a big mistake.
 I tried to open the door with no sound.
 As I turned in the entryway to close the door as quietly as I had opened it, I felt a presence.
 I turned around and two hands were on my neck choking me and shoving me against the door.
 Dino, in the darkness, had a grip on my neck that he would not release.
 I grabbed his wrist and tried to push his hands off to no avail.
 I couldn’t breathe, so I couldn’t talk.
 It was oddly silent except for a pinging sound, as if someone was dropping pennies in a pan.
 It was the sound of the puka shells from the necklace I was wearing landing on the tile floor beneath me.
 Ping, ping, puh dit dit, ping.

He was underground, in a cave.
 He groaned and sat up, his back throbbing.
 His head was pounding so hard he had to close his eyes to keep from passing out.
 He felt worse than he did when the stupid faery smashed his sword into his head.
 He looked around the dimly lit cavern and spotted Jazell, sprawled out on the floor.
 He crawled over to her.
 *** I couched and gagged, turning over.
 Dirt fell to the ground from my dry mouth.
 I looked over to see Seth fall back on the ground, breathing heavily.
 I looked around the room and up at the sky, but I couldn't really see it.

I’ll be here alone, except for Rune.
 He’s to continue my practice.
 Chevelle approached during his pacing and I slid the book into my pack, pretending to examine the beading on the material of the dress.
 This seemed to disturb him.
 He avoided pacing near me the rest of the evening, throwing me odd glances now and again.
 I shrugged it off and went back to reading.
 Father has been gone for weeks.
 Rumor is he’s searching for a new mate.
 Someone unique, someone powerful, I’m sure.
 I can’t stand it anymore.

It was easier to just cinch my pants up a little and avoid mirrors.
 Even when I did remember, the calories in didn't seem quite able to keep up with the calories my body routinely burned up.
 I guess panic attacks are harder on your system than most people realize.
 My body had already started spiraling down to an attack again, but before I could get too wobbly, I made it inside the house.
 Mom met me at the bottom of the creaking stairs with a big smile on her tired face.
 "The view from the rooms as the sun starts to set is even better than I thought it would be.
 Coming here was the best idea we've ever had."
 Normally Mom's enthusiasm was fairly catching.
 You expect that kind of energy in a child; when it comes from an adult it's hard not to react in kind.
 It didn't manage to infect me this time, but it did help focus me on the here and now.

It sliced through and the creature screeched so loud I was afraid everyone would hear it.
 The stinger fell on the ground and dark blood oozed from the cut.
 “Now Jazell!” Seth yelled to me.
 I notched an arrow and took aim at the thrashing belly.
 I pulled the string back and released it.
 The arrow whizzed through the air and sunk into the creature’s belly.
 It shook and fell to the ground.
 Seth ran from underneath it right before it crushed him.
 He turned around and studied it.
 Then there was a horrible sound, like ripping metal.

 She looked up to see if she was close to Rick's house.

 Panicking, she began to run.
 A woman was coming out of one house, wearing very short blue trousers, and Marie ran in the other direction.
 She had to find Rick's house!

UNDP's approach to human security and sustainable development is an important contribution to this effort.
 3.Social organization index: It is now widely recognized that a country's social organization or 'social capital' is a key determinant of its development.
 Measures and indices such as UNDP's Human Development Index that provide a comparative national assessment of progress on key dimensions of development generate greater awareness and stimulate greater political will and social initiative to improve performance.
 In a similar manner, UNDP should commission a programme to construct a Social Organization or Social Capital Index consisting of one or more scales to measure the organizational development of countries covering major sectors such as commerce, industry, agriculture, education, health care, and technical training.
 The index should evaluate the level of social organization in terms of its overall support to activities in each of these fields as well as the number and quality of institutions providing this support.
 Where objective measures are not possible, a rank or relative scale will suffice.
 These scales can then be utilized by countries to assess their own level of organizational development and to identify key areas where improvement is most needed.
 4.Scale of Productive -Skills: UNESCO should commission studies to construct a series of scales to measure the level of key skills in societies at different stages of development.
 The scales should assess the quantitative and qualitative development of key physical, technical, vocational and organizational skills, so that countries can more accurately identify high priority areas for training.

Rodregas unrolled the blanket on the back of the now mostly empty wagon showing the dozen books that he had saved from Ravenhurr’s library.
 Imeralda reached out for one of the closest, but then stopped as her fingers touched them, as if a spark of lightning had hit her.
 Obviously, she could feel that same power Rodregas had.
 That was interesting.
 She then ran her hand from one to the next until she had touched all twelve books.
 Then, she looked up and her expression reminded Rodregas of some girl who had gotten the perfect mid winter gift that she had been dreaming of.
 “These are not books on magic,” she said.
 “These are Grimoires, several of them of great power.” “Really?” Rodregas said, “I was a squire who learned a little magic, but I really can’t say that I know the difference between a book of magic and a Grimoire.” Imeralda looked surprised and said, “Oh, you guys must depend on the oral tradition.
 That is a hard way to learn.
 The symbols and geometric figures that form a powerful spell are often too complex to learn from just the spoken word.” Rodregas cut in and clarified, “I mean, in the order we did read books on magic theory and history, but I never felt energy from them before.” Imeralda nodded, “Let me explain.

Much like me, Junnie was practically alone.
 Her family had all received the calling “to serve elfkind.” I didn’t know exactly what that meant, only that the elf usually left with fanfare and seldom returned in fewer than a hundred years.
 It was apparently a very honorable thing, though she never seemed proud.
 Just off the living area was the study, larger than the front room, stuffed full of documents and lit by a pair of dim oil lanterns.
 Dust covered the decrepit scrolls and books lining the walls, but aside from a well-used worktable, the room was clean.
 Settling onto my usual stool, I leaned forward, elbows on the carved edge of the table to prop my head up for the monotonous hours to come.
 It was hard to say how long I sat so, looking down on a huge volume entitled The Great Elves of Varkenshire, pretending to read.
 But my eyes had wandered from the page to a small thistle where it rested among some other potion ingredients.
 It had begun to extend its leaves.
 I was startled; Junnie was preoccupied with a lengthy scroll across the room and couldn’t have possibly been the source, and I had never made anything grow.

I couldn't see much beyond the boy's wild red hair, but even that was enough to tell he wasn't completely comfortable.
 I wanted to turn around and go back the other way, but there was a chance that Jasmin had already seen me, and if so I couldn't afford to look like I was scared of her.
 The fact I actually was terrified she was going to snap and start trying to kill people was irrelevant.
 If I could convince her I wasn't scared, I was less likely to get hurt.
 I kept walking, not necessarily steering closer to the three-quarter wall the boy was leaning against, but also being very careful not to go out of my way to stay further away from them either.
 As I got close to the pair, a little more of the boy became visible, reaffirming my impression that he wasn't happy to be talking to her.
 His shoulders looked unnaturally tight and he was shaking his head slowly from side to side.
 Locked as I was into my course, I couldn't help but hear them both as I got closer.
 "I can't do this, Jasmin.
 I've been meaning to tell you for a while, but I was afraid of how you'd react."

Korin hit with a hard smack and slid to the ground, hurt, but not badly.
 Rodregas slammed the door closed and relocked it.
 Then he quickly reached down and covered Korin’s mouth, pulled him up, and slipped behind him.
 Rodregas saw Korin’s bulging eyes as he tried to get a better look at his captor.
 Korin struggled but not as if his life depended on it.
 He was probably confused.
 The image of the day that Rodregas had started to hate him came back.
 A family of AElves had been taken prisoner; they were just common AElves with no real magic.
 Korin was interested in the father, a good-looking man.
 The wife was equally beautiful and they had a slim child named Jorin.

It is a question of choice.
 Evolutionary Opportunities
 What then is the justification for predicting a bright future?
 There are political, economic, social and technological forces active in the world today that can override the causality of past trends and combine together to make this a time of unprecedented opportunity.
 Intellectual synthesis: War is the result of a conflict that leads to a forceful resolution followed by a fresh period of progress.
 The end of the Second World War marked the defeat of fascism.
 It gave birth to the United Nations, followed by the dissolution of colonial empires and freedom for more than forty subject nations.
 The end of the Cold War marks the end of a seventy-year confrontation between two opposing ideologies – capitalist and socialist – that reflected a more profound conflict between two fundamental aspects of human existence – individual freedom and social responsibility.
 The posing of these two as opposite and mutually exclusive forces has for long limited our freedom of thought and action and prevented us from boldly experimenting with new ways to reconcile them.
 The peaceful termination of this confrontation has lowered the mental barriers.

“Couldn’t sleep either, Jeremiah?” he asked.
 “Aye, had the worst nightmares.” Jeremiah glanced at the sword in the farmer’s hand.
 “You feel the same, don’t you?”
 The farmer nodded.
 “Feels like the dark god himself is coming for us.
 Part of me wants to grab my children and run.”
 “Perhaps it is a warning,” Jeremiah said.
 “Ashhur may be granting us a chance.

Harruq snarled and shook his head.
 He shouldn’t have spoken to him.
 Shouldn’t have let him ask questions.
 The last of his adrenaline faded as images of the child’s quivering lips and trembling hands haunted his vision.
 “Half,” Harruq whispered as he wiped blood from his swords onto the grass.
 “Only half.”
 The kill had been quick, just a single cut through the shoulder blade, the heart, and then the lung.
 No suffering, little pain.
 It was all he could offer.
 “He’s dead, Qurrah,” the half-orc shouted.

 The group stared at me.
 “Frey?” Ruby asked.
 I grappled for breath.
 “Just a dream.” A few chuckles moved through the crowd.
 Ruby was more interested.
 “What about?” I glanced at Chevelle, a few paces away.
 He had the same concerned expression as they waited for my answer.
 I only shook my head.
 My chest still ached from panic.

“No more have to die,” the elf said.
 The flesh around his eyes sagged wearily, and he leaned against the window to aid in standing.
 It was as if grief had rendered him lifeless.
 Let go, Qurrah thought.
 He could let go.
 Fall down the cliff, and find what awaited him at the bottom.
 All he had to do was let go of the bones.
 The confusion burned hotter in his gut.
 “You’re right,” Qurrah said, standing to his full height.
 “No more have to die.

I'd been too overwhelmed by everything else to really register the fact that everyone was wearing some form of stretchy clothing.
 I'd never thought about how changing shapes must make for difficulty when it came to clothing choices, but it appeared someone had solved the problem.
 Dom's black outfit had perfectly matched her fur, and whatever it was, it had shrunk down to fit her four-legged form, while still having enough elasticity to expand out to cover her person shape.
 The girl's clothes had an elastic band of some kind at their necks, legs and arms, while the boys were wearing a pants-like number which cinched down over their waist, as well as just above the knees.
 My preoccupation over what everyone was wearing gave Dom a chance to cover the distance between us.
 Donovan smiled as Dom reached us.
 "I'll leave her in your care then, Mistress Sanchez?"
 Alec watched Donovan leave, and then turned back to the pack and chivvied them back into motion.
 I grabbed onto Dom's hand with enough force to bruise a normal person as Isaac and James turned on each other with a sudden ferocity that left me breathless.
 "It's okay.

As my horse knelt, he held out his hand and I stepped down beside him.
 The three stallions followed Steed to a nearby tree where he fed them small green-skinned apples from its branches.
 I glanced back to Chevelle.
 He was watching me.
 I wanted to ask if this was where he was from, but was afraid to set off any conversation that might end with me being hauled back to council that much quicker.
 I looked again out over the lake to the mountains.
 If I was incarcerated for a thousand years in the village, I would want this memory.
 I breathed deep; the air was cool, moist, and smelled so unlike the harsh floral scents that saturated every part of the village.
 I could sense the deep green moss covering the rocks at my feet, the fir trees that edged the east bank.
 Even the soil smelled richer.

Its long, leathery wings were tucked neatly on each of its sides.
 It snorted as Emily climbed onto its back.
 I stared at her, starting to think she was a little crazy.
 “Come on!” she said and patted the dragon's back.
 “Do you think that you're too heavy?
 Well, you aren't, so get on his back.” I walked over and climbed onto the dragon's back.
 Jason half hauled Seth on the dragon's back, and Seth almost fell on me.
 He grunted a sorry and pushed himself up in sitting position.
 Jason hopped on last and gave Emily two thumbs up.
 “Alright,” she called.

That pleasure was only one of many that day.
 First she loaded the dishwasher while Rick supervised, and she poured in the soap and started the machine herself.
 After a shower, she had lessons on the use of the food processor, the blender, and--delight of delights--the microwave oven.
 "I can make lunch now," she proclaimed happily.
 "Do you like to cook?"
 "Yes."
 But her face fell.
 "To be honest, I don't know how.
 We have a cook.
 But I'd like to try."

Three weeks after these interviews were concluded, Buddy Gardner was found dead in his home, with a needle in his arm.
 Lorelei had disappeared.
 These tapes somehow also disappeared until 1999, when they were found in a stockroom in an abandoned studio in Los Angeles by a technician there who, with some heaven-sent Extra Sensitive Perception, sent them to Camel Jeremy Eros, c/o City Lights Bookstore, where for a while I was taking my mail, while recovering from a broken relationship, one that emasculated me, silenced me, did me up a treat.
 These tapes were a godsend—they took me out of myself, out of the self-pity I was wallowing in.
 Many thanks to John Wender, editor extraordinaire, who recognized what we had here and ran them in his celebrated periodical.
 Hence, they ran first, almost in the form represented here, in three installments in Big City Magazine.
 ***
 Buddy Gardner died young, tragically, just weeks after these interviews were concluded.
 It lends a poignancy to what follows here, but is not the only reason to read, of course.
 There is Buddy’s stature as one of the truly original artists of his time.

The only effective evangelist I encountered in those days was Tony Tarantino, a lanky Jesus freak with frizzy red hair and an expression both bewildered and wise.
 I picked him up hitchhiking.
 He settled into the seat, set his Bible on his lap, stared at me for a minute and asked, “Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?” “Yep,” I said, and readied myself to field the standard subsequent questions.
 Tony said, “Oh.
 Good.” A week later, he was leading a Bible study at our house.
 Cliff’s not much of a talker.
 I believe nobody heard his stories from Vietnam until years afterward.
 I don’t pry, so I can’t be sure what goes on inside him, but I have no reason to think he believes in God, or that he doesn’t.
 But whether he believes or not, Cliff has gotten well blessed since our evening with Billy Graham.
 He has four wonderful kids, and Toni, who is one of those rarest of people who appear to grow brighter, stronger, and more beautiful every year.

Brandon let the silence build for several seconds.
 "I'd try and convince you I'm not going to do any of that to you, but I suspect that's just going to take time."
 I was busy kicking myself for having cast such a pall over the morning, when Brandon sighed.
 "We should talk about what happened to you yesterday."
 "I don't know what you're talking about.
 Nothing happened."
 Deny everything.
 It's essentially the motto of two entire generations now.
 Make them tell you exactly how much they know before you admit to anything, and then only admit to the parts they already know about.
 It's a crappy way to run a society, but I'm just one kid.

The ones from which magic radiated he placed into the trunk; true books of magic would sell nicely.
 The process of sorting the books and then getting them to burn took several hours and he started to feel how long it had been since his new body had slept.
 The sound of the tower was changing, the first sounds of the kitchen crew getting ready for the morning.
 Still he kept at it, though there seemed to be nothing else of wealth in the room.
 He was determined to see the evil books burn.
 They held the secrets to the Immortalist art and other dark magic.
 Leaving them would only lead to another person rising in Ravenhurr’s place.
 Several of the foulest books seemed to refuse to burn but the flames eventually consumed all, just as they had consumed Ravenhurr.
 Finally, the last of the dark books of magic were burned, and the few remaining books that felt of magic but lacked the evil stench of the others were packed in the trunk.
 Only six volumes had been free of the stench, while over forty were burned.

 I'm rather tired, and I think I'd just like to relax and think about all that happened today."
 "And dream about your debut?"
 He smiled.
 "We'll go see the movie as soon as it comes out.
 And buy the video when it comes out."
 He was thrilled when she didn't say she'd probably be back in 1927 before then.
 She was quiet during the ride home, remembering the scene she'd done.
 And how she'd peered through a camera.
 And sat in a director's chair as he walked his sitcom actors through a scene.

The wolves do not follow the elves.
 The wolves protect them by choice.” “By choice?” “Yes.
 And I have seen them tear an elf apart as quickly as defend them.” I shivered.
 “Rhys and Rider were saved by the wolves once.
 They think the animals understand.
 They follow the wolves, you see.
 That is why they are here.” We topped the ridge, jagged rock and loose dirt shifting beneath our feet, and Ruby dropped the quiver by the edge before climbing down with a deftness I had yet to master.
 Steed, Anvil, and Grey greeted us before we resumed training.
 I tried to keep my mind off the wolves, off the reason we were training, off the encounter with Chevelle, off all of the terrible things it kept returning to, and I was grateful for the fog that clouded my thoughts.
 Though I wasn’t exactly winning matches, I was getting better.

We're best friends; you should totally have trusted me enough to tell me."
 Apparently I'd only thought the anger was under control.
 It frothed beneath the surface right now, anxious for a reason to bite someone's head off, and Britney was the preferred target.
 Only I needed her.
 Not enough to completely dismiss what had happened though.
 "I don't know what you're talking about, but I honestly wouldn't have told you anything I wanted kept a secret.
 Not after the way you told everyone about my panic attacks."
 Britney looked like she was having a hard time getting enough air.
 She gasped a couple more times, and then managed to get some words out.
 "I'm so sorry.

"That's a pretty detailed analysis of a book you've never read."
 Rachel blushed a little.
 "I really haven't read it.
 Maybe because I'm worried that it won't turn out to be what I think it will be.
 What about you?"
 I shouldn't have been surprised by the question, but I was.
 Possibly because I'd spent too much time around people like Britney who were so caught up in their own lives that they didn't really care about what was happening in mine.
 "Les Misérables.
 The music from the musical is so inspiring that I know the book must be truly wonderful."
 I let the statement hang in the air for a couple of seconds, and then finished up with the truth.

He looked as if he thought I might spook, otherwise I guessed he had plenty to say hidden beneath that smirk.
 It didn’t stop him from moving uncomfortably close, though, or eyeing me with what I was certain was the same look I’d just given my meal.
 I cleared my throat, thinking I’d made my sense of discomfort clear when he started to move, but he only stood, which brought him even closer.
 Well, parts of him.
 I turned toward the fire, tugging the pack tight against my shoulder as I prepared for a graceful exit.
 For departure from food and warmth.
 I jumped a little when the first tree uprooted across the clearing.
 It was only a sapling, but the second and third tree followed.
 “You look like you’ll need shelter, sunshine,” he explained.
 I stared in disbelief as the trees split to form a low lean-to.

They asked me what I wanted from the nearby hamburger joint as they relayed orders to another officer via a cell phone.
 I wanted nothing!
 Eating was the last thing on my mind and my stomach was churning with every passing moment.
 I just wanted to get on with it and go home in one piece.
 It was an odd sight for me as I watched these officers chow down their burgers and sip on their drinks reminiscing about the drug deal they just finished.
 Just another day at the office, I guess.
 In a moment, my crack-berry starts to blow up with one call after the next from Ashley, wanting to know when we are doing this deal.
 I must keep buying time with excuses, now nearing a two-hour delay waiting for the cops to come from the other bust.
 It is looking like this deal is not going to happen either.
 I answer some of the calls and ignore others as I am instructed to do by Officer White.

Then we ran for our lives.
 The night Eric joined us, so did big Mike Beatty.
 He was about 6’6”, 280 pounds.
 We rode with a cabby to three motels.
 After the first, Eric said, “This is bad, Ken.
 I hate this.” At the second motel, he gave the girl half his money, for nothing.
 We were leaving the third place when he asked me, “Why do you do this?” "Excitement?"
 I guessed.
 Mike was sitting behind the driver’s seat.
 While the cabbie waited for an opening into the boulevard traffic, Mike leaned up close and growled, “It’s a good thing you don’t plan to get us roughed up, or else I’d have to pinch your head off.” The cabby muttered something in Spanish and made a face that seemed to say, “Go ahead, what do I care?” At an historic saloon called The Long Bar, Eric told me about all three prostitutes he’d talked to, where they came from, how large their families were, and he remembered most of their entire formal names.

I couldn’t spot a single feature that appeared more saintly or pure.
 I felt no more likely to hand over my jacket to whomever asked, let alone to throw in my shirt.
 The only change I recognized, I felt more confounded than ever.
 Someone had told me, when you drink tequila, make sure you count the shots.
 So I kept count.
 I was on seven, and still waiting for the buzz, when I sensed my stool tipping backward.
 If I had asked, once I recovered, Cliff would’ve told me what else happened between the time I started tipping and the morning after.
 But I preferred not to know.
 I already had earned at least enough shame for a guy my age.
 The way I recall, I tipped backward and landed in the shotgun seat of our Chevy, where I woke up shivering.

“No.
 Some prefer the meat not to be tainted by magic.
 They feel it is more… pure.” He pronounced ‘tainted’ with an edge.
 “Is it?
 Tainted I, mean?” “I have lived on it for—” His words caught midsentence and he said, “Well, it doesn’t seem to be, but to each his own.” He turned back to the fire.
 Junnie came back into view, a large animal slung over her shoulders, bow in hand.
 She dropped her burden on a smooth gray rock near the fire and whispered a short thanks before removing the arrow to skin the animal.
 My gaze moved between the sizeable carcass and her lithe form.
 “I’ll be traveling fast and far and don’t intend to stop and hunt.
 I will pack the extra with me.” I managed a sheepish smile.

 She stretched out on her stomach.
 He ran his hands up and down and around her back, massaging and caressing.
 Her skin was so soft.
 He dropped a kiss onto her shoulder.
 "Does that feel good?"
 "Mmm," she murmured sleepily.
 Moving her hair aside, he kissed the nape of her neck.
 Then he moved down, slowly pressing kisses along the length of her spine.

"Hmmm--there's a piece at the top too."
 His free hand slid along her waist and up to her shoulder blade, the result being an embrace.
 "Now you're lint free."
 She laughed again.
 "You might have lint on your back too."
 She put her arms around him.
 He smiled down into her face, which was now tantalizingly close to his.
 He quickly pressed his cheek to her hair, tightening his arms for just a moment before releasing her.
 "Come on--let's go see what else we can find."
 He took her to a drugstore, handing her a 20-dollar bill and wandering off when he realized that there were some toiletries she needed but was too embarrassed to pick up while he was watching.

See, we were naives, kids.
 We just did what was natural, we didn’t know from creating a suite, or anything pretentious like that.
 Man, we just wanted to get our chops in, create a little noise.
 That’s raw sound on that record, see, that’s live.
 None of it was fiddled with, enhanced, whatever.
 Except that playful tape loop, and that fade-out on “For Kim,” that’s just us, beating our brains out in that little studio, high on bennies.
 “For Kim, Because it Went by So Fast”---we worked our asses off to get that one right.
 I don’t know what was wrong really.
 It was a song I’d written right before we went into the studio, so we’d never done it live—maybe that was the reason we struggled with it.
 But, the lyrics, you know, they’re a little complex: “I took my Melville out into the sun, what else could I do, I was in my twenties” it begins.

Rodregas realized his hand was sinking into the skin.
 He tried to pull back but felt himself being drawn into it.
 He was being pulled physically into the panther.
 He started to pull away, but then he stopped and let himself sink into the shape of the great beast.
 Panic set in as his mouth started to sink into the creature’s head.
 He tried to hold his breath, but he was too late for such an action.
 Rodregas tried to move but his arms refused to reach out and push the Daemon away.
 His arms felt wrong, like he had no arms to push.
 Then, true panic set in and he tried to fight his way free.
 Something was wrong, the greater sigil was not becoming part of him, he was being made part of the sigil.

He had a painted on smile that couldn’t be trusted.
 It was the same smile every time and it was anything but genuine and it could turn to angry gritted teeth in a moment.
 He was terrifyingly loud and strong, and we were not accustomed to being told what to do by a man.
 We did our best to stay out of his way, particularly when he was drinking, but he would always find us.
 My brother Thomas and I had become very good at yard work and chores as we learned to perform them with perfection or pay the price of Dino’s disappointment.
 Every weekend was filled with hours upon hours of yard work at Dino’s command.
 If we ran out of work to do, Dino would have us move a scrap woodpile from one end of the backyard to another, then back again if he wasn’t done with us.
 Sometimes Dino would stand in the backyard and direct us with a garden hose nozzle, spraying us from one chore to the next.
 Dino was sick.
 We never knew when we were going to get knocked across the room.

He had expected his nemesis, the White Stag, but instead walked a woman.
 Her long legs somehow managed to keep pace with him.
 Her hair, as golden as his own fur, rained down her curved back; she wore a glowing short white shift adorned with many pouches.
 “Why do you hunt with me, Goddess?” The Lion growled.
 The Goddess Blodeuwedd answered, “I am proud of you.
 I will be truthful, I shared my favor with you simply as a matter of convenience.
 I hoped you might succeed.
 I did not think you would live, much less add to your power and gather more hunters to our pride.” The great Lion shook his head, the ways of the winds and the speech of gods were the same, fickle and not to be truly understood.
 Yet he sensed that somehow the words sounded fair and right in some way that he could not really explain.
 Blodeuwedd smiled at him, a smile that answered nothing but claimed to answer everything.

Harruq shrugged.
 “Never seemed a big deal to us.
 Others were better off.
 A few were worse.
 We did what we had to live, just like everybody else.”
 He ran a hand through his now shoulder-length hair, shaking away loose strands.
 It felt odd having so little hair on his head.
 Aurelia sat down on her legs, her hands folded upon her dress.
 “Harruq, have you killed before?” she asked.
 The half-orc opened his mouth and then closed it.

“Kojas will destroy you, half-ling.” “That is it, I’m sick of your riddles!
 Give me a darn straight answer or I’ll shoot every single one of you,” I spat angrily, leveling my bow.
 “Kill all you like half-ling, but that won’t help you in the end.
 You will pay heavily in a terrible death worth all the loyal lives you’ve slayed,” the dwarf proclaimed, and his friends bellowed out an agreement.
 “I don’t care what the heck you say about dying because nothing will stop me from killing all of you!
 You’re making no apparent sense at all, and I don’t care what stupid message you’re trying to send me!” I hissed so bad I think that I spit.
 Gross.
 “Oh but you will care, half-ling.” The dwarf was now whispering and all the others had fallen silent so they could hear.
 “You will care because in the end, he will destroy you once he’s done using you.” My arms were still tense and my muscles whined in protest as I held my arrow back in full draw.
 “Use me to do what?” I spoke, using the same tone as him.

A startled yelp bounced off of the valley walls, and then Donovan relaxed slightly and started forward.
 "We should be safe now.
 Master Alec seems to have things well in hand."
 His word choice didn't inspire an overabundance of confidence, but I could hardly turn and run away after begging to be allowed to come watch.
 The path seemed to shrink as we were walking, and almost too quickly sand replaced the crunch of gravel under our feet.
 I recognized Alec's humanoid form from before, a massive, black, heavily furred tower of muscle, claws and fangs.
 I might have pulled back at his approach, but the eyes, even with their vertical pupils were still undeniably his.
 A paler, more icy blue than I was used to, but it was still him looking out at me from the other side.
 Everyone else was harder to pick out, but I gave it my best shot.
 Isaac was probably the bluish-black hybrid who was nearly as big as Alec.

When the battle comes, slaughter the elves from behind.
 You must weaken them enough so that Vaelor’s army has a chance at victory.”
 “We will not fail,” Qurrah promised.
 “Where will we meet you?”
 “Listen for where the screams are at their worst,” Velixar said as his shadow began to fade.
 “There shall I be.”
 A pale hand reached inside his robes and pulled out five glass vials.
 Qurrah knelt and accepted the gifts.
 “The vials contain powerful healing elixirs.
 If either of you are injured tomorrow, drink from them and resume the slaughter anew.”

 In fact, if you're still around tomorrow afternoon, I'll probably be home by 5:30."
 "Why?"
 "You're a lot of fun to be with."
 Her smile lit her face.
 "Really?"
 "Yeah.
 I've had a terrific time this weekend."
 "So have I."
 "And if you were mine," he continued, happy that she wasn't angry, "I would hold you every time you let me.

He had spent hard years on the road and knew not to trust people that you have just met.
 You especially do not trust people who try to kill you while you sleep.
 And as long as people thought he might be Ravenhurr, maybe a little crazy from a spell gone wrong or something, the less likely the Guild of the Celestial Path would send the Immortal Guards against him.
 So Rodregas said, “Let’s just say I am trying to figure out who I am.
 You can call me…,” he thought for a minute, making it obvious he was making up a fake name.
 He did not want to use his real name.
 He thought to himself, “Who do I want to be?” “If I’m going to try to fight against the Immortalists, then some sort of name fit for a Celestial Paladin, or maybe one fit for an Infernal adversary was needed,” he thought with a smile.
 The only way he could have survived the ceremony would have been divine intervention, so he said the first thing that came to mind, “You can call me Sir Paladin, that will work for now,” he said it with a smile and a slight snicker at his own joke.
 “Just what kind of Paladin would you be?” Imeralda asked him.
 “Why, it should be obvious to you more than anyone,” Rodregas said with a slight bow to the beautiful half AElf.

Actual gains could be very much higher.
 These subsidies cost Western consumers several hundred billion dollars annually.
 In addition, they lead to dumping of surplus sugar, cereal, milk and beef in developing countries, often pushing down the prices which farmers in these countries receive for their produce to far below their production cost.
 The benefits of eliminating these subsidies would be multiple.
 For instance, eliminating subsidies to sugar-beet growers and dairy farmers in Europe would stimulate greater demand, not only for imported sugar from developing countries, but also for cocoa, which combined with sugar and milk is the basis for the chocolate industry.
 Measures of this type will result in substantially increased demand for agricultural products from developing countries, the first step in an upward spiral of global economic growth that will stimulate industrial exports and job growth in both East and West.
 2.Global, environmentally sustainable Green Revolution.
 The term 'Green Revolution' has been praised for its positive impact on crop productivity and criticized for its likely adverse effects on the environment and social equity.
 It is often overlooked that one of the most beneficial consequences of the Green Revolution has been its 'forest-saving' nature.
 If agricultural production had not been increased through higher productivity, more forest land would have been diverted to annual cropping.

I didn’t write a fucking thing, didn’t even read the newspapers.
 I don’t mean to imply that I could have done something, that I had any more power than the Pope or The Beatles or, you know, fucking McNamara.
 I mean, though, that I wanted to know, I wanted to understand.
 I wanted the information that Walter Cronkite or Eric Sevareid had, the insider stuff, so that I wasn’t just up there entertaining the fuel for the fire, you know, like the orchestras that played as the Jews were led into the ovens.
 I started to feel like that, that I was a chimp, a dancing fool.
 This was like before The Moratorium, right?
 Before we really all felt the power.
 The War was just this endless one-note playing over and over and driving us insane—me insane, sorry, driving me insane.
 And, like, I know that a song is just a song—yet, I have to believe there is something there, an element, a catalytically charged element.
 I didn’t want religion—who listens to priests, clergymen, even those who take to the streets?

While the sun was still a sliver peeking over the horizon, Aurelia shook Harruq’s shoulders to wake him.
 She then sat back and put her hands to her forehead while the half-orc tried to remember where he was.
 “Can you find him?” Harruq asked her, realizing what she was doing.
 He sat on his rear and began readjusting his armor to his more slender frame.
 “In time,” she said.
 “I have met him only once, but I doubt there are any like him.
 Stay quiet and be patient.”
 Her mind was a net, and she cast it further and further out, scanning the rolling hills and the plains beyond.
 “Found him,” she whispered.

Brandon had at one time been moving thousands of these tiny green prescription pain pills through California, making nighttime drives to Los Angeles and back to buy huge quantities to supply the Sacramento area.
 They were charging him with three felonies and he was facing five plus years in prison.
 Faced with the charges, Brandon waved his attorney rights and talked too much— a strung out drug addict who just got popped.
 The interrogation lasted nearly twenty hours; although, to Brandon, it felt like three days.
 Faced with the abundance of evidence and the thought of five years in prison, Brandon broke and agreed to bust a dealer named Steve.
 The interesting thing about Steve was that much of the information the officers had on Brandon was from Steve.
 It’s quite a tangled web.
 Steve had been busted some time ago and released when he agreed to work with the narcotics division of the police department.
 Steve’s bust was kept a secret so he could fold back into the drug world unnoticed and collect information on drug dealers like my son and share that information with the officers so they could set up these dealers.
 Steve was tasked with introducing undercover officers into the inner circle that would eventually lead to a bust that appeared to be far removed from the original contact with Steve.

It tasted of... Rodregas did not know what to call the flavor; the words that came to mind were sunlight and rain and the smell of a forest at night.
 When Rodregas finished the fruit completely he felt more whole but was also sad that it was gone.
 Imeralda seemed in great humor.
 “Come on,” she said.
 She dropped to her hands on the edge of the branch and then dropped down as if she was only feet from the ground which, strangely she was.
 Rodregas saw her standing on the ground.
 It was not that she had floated down.
 It was as if she had she had been in a regular sized tree.
 She smiled and waved at him to follow her.
 Rodregas decided to follow her example.

Instinct pushing me, I ran for the clearing where I’d learned with Chevelle.
 He was there, waiting for me.
 The pain in my chest dulled a little.
 Or maybe it was only overwhelmed by a new pressure.
 I crossed to him slowly.
 Junnie was all I’d had since I came here and now she was gone.
 For a hundred years, she’d be gone.
 I wanted nothing more of Fannie.
 Nothing more of any of this.
 I didn’t know what I would do, but by the time I reached Chevelle, I knew what I wanted: to retrieve my mother’s things from the vault.

 I saved you from the gallows.
 I would prefer to know more about the life I spared.”

Rachel packed up her things while I was being instructed in the finer points of inequalities.
 As she slid the last book into her backpack, Albert stepped away from my desk with another smile.
 I flipped over to the next chapter and started in on functions as Rachel exited out a corner door I hadn't noticed before.
 I saw a flash of the stunted, brown vegetation that the locals called grass before the door swung back closed.
 Suppressing an urge to just surrender and go outside until Britney finished up, I got started.
 The roar of some kind of high-performance engine a few seconds later almost changed my mind, but my native stubbornness kicked in before I let the thought get out of hand.
 The subject matter was harder than graphing, but I persevered, and managed to make it through all fifteen problems without resorting to the red side of the card.
 Of course Albert did stop by to see if I was having any difficulties, but since I didn't summon him, he couldn't read anything into it.
 When Britney stomped over and asked if I was done, I considered telling her I needed ten more minutes.
 Her being an attention hog didn't justify me being petty though.

The next thing I knew I was on the ground with my ears ringing and Cassie standing over me.
 "...your stupid lies.
 If you repeat them you'll be sorry.
 Every single person here will vouch for Brandon."
 A couple of people flinched a little at that, like they weren't completely comfortable lying, but Cassie stared them down.
 Nobody would meet my gaze.
 I opened my mouth to protest, and Cassie grabbed me by the front of my jacket and dragged me the better part of twenty feet.
 My head was still spinning as she leaned down and hissed into my ear.
 "Get out of here.
 Don't wait around, don't ask anyone for a ride.

“This place looks like it’s from a book about hell,” Seth said.
 “Where are we now?” I asked.
 He shook his head.
 “Do we ever know where we are?” I shook my head and he sighed.
 “Exactly, we never do.
 You really got to stop asking that question.” He started to hike the hill.
 “We‘re trying to find out.” I walked up behind him, my leg muscles cramping.
 When we got to the top, I fell on my knees and breathed heavily.
 Seth looked over his shoulder, his eyes twinkling in amusement.
 “Am I too fast for you, Jazell?” “No way,” I huffed.

But then I pictured the smirk on her face as she mocked me to the villagers, to Council, and couldn’t stop the resentment from boiling up.

 Elves didn’t sneeze.
 Fairies sneezed.
 Forest creatures sneezed.
 Not elves.

Coping with the environmental problems to preserve the ecological foundations essential for sustainable agriculture is an area in which government has special responsibilities and must play a leading role on an ongoing basis.
 Regulating the diversion of prime farm land for non-farm uses, expansion of irrigation capacity, control of groundwater exploitation, major programmes for reforestation and to prevent or reverse desertification, and regulation of pesticide use can only be effectively planned, monitored and regulated by governments.
 Comprehensive Strategies
 In this and previous chapters, we have tried to present an integrated perspective of the political, economic and technological factors that need to be taken into account in formulating a comprehensive approach to the issues of peace, food and employment.
 In an effort to illustrate the potential efficacy of this approach in a country representing nearly 25 per cent of the world’s poor, ICPF conducted an in-depth country level study in India to evolve a strategy for stimulating massive increases in job growth and food production (see box pp.
 122–24).
 PROSPERITY 2000 STRATEGY FOR INDIA
 The potential for accelerating job creation and increasing food production through a mix of the strategies discussed in this report is illustrated by the strategy which ICPF has proposed to achieve full employment in India and thereby to raise the entire population above the poverty line by generating additional employment opportunities for 100 million persons in the coming decade.
 This strategy utilizes agriculture as an engine for growth by accelerating the development of commercial agriculture, agro-industry and agro-exports.
 It calls for a shift in thinking concerning agriculture from production for survival and subsistence to production for maximum and sustainable profit, from emphasis on meeting minimum needs to realizing maximum potentials, from commodity-based to resource-based planning.

The Growth and Death of Buddy Gardner by Dana Illsire © 1975
 You know Buddy “Slipshod” Gardner from his later solo work, the early seventies stuff when he latched onto the singer/songwriter craze begun probably by Sweet Baby James.
 You know him for his albums “Rain and Other Distractions” or “I Was a Child When Smaller.”  But this is the story of headier days, days when the Overton Park Shell was a magical place, the later rainbow implied.
 When Buddy played lead guitar and sang for Black Lung, a blues rock band with a loyal Memphis following.
 The late Lee Baker, a guitar god himself then, said about Buddy, “He was the best of us.
 He was a seer, a prophet.
 That later acoustic stuff is crap, of course, but with Black Lung, Buddy was tapped into something other.” Back then, Black Lung played the Shell regularly, maybe opening for Johnny Winter, or teaming up with Mudboy and The Expanding Head Band for a mini-festival that would start at dusk and stumble into the early morning hours like a dreamer looking for paradise.
 Lot of medicine passed about in those days.
 Lot of prescriptions from the hoodoo man.
 It was the sixties, people, and in Memphis that meant The Strip, The Shell, The Bitter Lemon.

 Was it-- "Ready?"
 She jumped.
 "Oh.

 If you're lost, I'll find you."
 She nodded and started to turn to go into the garden.
 But Rick caught her hand, stopping her.

While she was having fun, her parents were in a panic over her.
 She had to get back to them.
 But what if she couldn't?
 She hadn't been able to this morning.
 Swallowing, she looked up at Rick.

 "Then you'll try again Tuesday morning."
 He squeezed her hand.
 "Don't worry, Marie.
 You'll get back sooner or later.

I went to her apartment where I caught them together.
 I beat him within an inch of his life in front of her.
 Karen and her roommate did everything they could to pull me off of him but my rage for his complete abandonment of our friendship in so many ways had escalated to the perfect storm.
 It seemed he had taken everything from me and he had been my closest friend for the last six years and I snapped.
 This was a defining moment in my life, where I began to truly understand what drugs could make you do.
 Pete and Karen later married, had a couple of kids and, in his late twenties, Pete died of a heroin overdose.
 I moved to the south side of the lake and began selling radio advertising.
 I still called Thomas in Sacramento often, as family is family, and he was about all I had left in that category and he was all I had growing up.
 He was my big brother and there was no changing that.
 I tried to forgive him for the part he played in my business failure, but I never confronted him; I just buried my resentment.

These Knights traded their honor for near immortality in the Guards.
 The Immortal Guards were all sigil warriors with one or several magical enhancements.
 They also had the best resources of the entire Eastern Realm, the most powerful enchanted armor, the best weapons; their officers rode Dire Beasts for steeds.
 Taking on a sigil warrior would be a huge challenge for Rodregas, or at least he thought it would be.
 He was still unclear of how strong and fast he was.
 His stomach hurt from his wound, but not as badly as it should.
 Clearly, the first step in his duty was to heal up from his wound and relearn how to fight in his new body.
 When he got up, Imeralda was already standing but Doi’van remained kneeling in thought.
 He nodded to Imeralda and she quietly followed him back into the barn.
 About ten minutes later Doi’van joined them and they started to plan how to clean up the barn.

Liz – Just after her fight with father.
 Jim – She fled into Gene’s awaiting arms?
 Must have been one terrible fight.
 Eugene – Hey!
 Liz – What is with that woman and trying to seduce my friends?
 Jim – Better Gene than me!
 Liz – Jim!
 Eugene – What’s that supposed to mean?
 Jim – What?
 It was creepy getting hit on by your mother.

I’m gonna use that melody behind you.
 And he did, man, he played what I was singing on a plastic tonette—no shit, that’s that weird, unearthly descant in the background, Jim on this little toy.
 It’s not in the credits, so you’re getting it first, right?
 And I just did my best Lou Reed impersonation, intoning, Her glances could break arms.
 Her hair was a nimbus of tangled nestings, life surrounded her like a cloak.
 When I went too deep she was quick to pull the plug.
 I still stay awake nights reliving the ignominy, forgetting to celebrate how we came together briefly, fiery angels.
 I think I was riffing, partly, adding to what I’d written, making it up as I went along.
 By that 16th run-through, my voice was tired anyway, and the guys were playing like they were drugged, and the song sounds like that.
 I love that cut, man.

 I wonder how I did that.
 Well, guess I’ll just have to put off being bizarre until later.
 I hope you don’t mind too much.
 Karen – I don’t mind at all.
 Actually since you know Elizabeth, do you think you can give me a tour of the show?

I suspected a prowler had clubbed her and swiped her few items of jewelry.
 But she managed a goofy smile and mumbled that she must’ve fallen, and getting up had seemed too hard to bother with.
 An ambulance carted her away.
 At the hospital, a nurse tapped her spine.
 The lab found meningitis.
 The only doctor who would talk to me gave her lousy odds.
 When she rallied, they took her to an isolation ward, to sequester her for months.
 At sixteen, some law or regulation wouldn’t allow me to live without an adult in the home.
 So I told the school I was staying with my aunt and uncle and told my aunt I was staying with Eric and Sylvia.
 In truth, Eric moved in with me.

The water.
 I remembered being trapped underwater just before waking, but I hadn’t been drowning.
 It wasn’t a dream.
 I was horrified as more of the memory returned.
 The cloaks who had surrounded my mother, killed her, had been circling me.
 I knew they’d intended to destroy me, too, though I couldn’t see why.
 Chevelle had held me, pulled me into the water.
 He had tried to keep them from finding me as they attacked, tried to keep me from calling out to her.
 The look of fear, the look of sympathy.
 He’d held me back to save me.

 “If there was any time I needed you, Sonowin, it is now,” the elf said as he fled across the grass.
 Each breath made his chest ache.
 His right arm hung limp, and his other hand clutched his shoulder.
 He desperately needed to bandage it but had no time.
 A wave of undead moans reached his sensitive ears.
 Dieredon shuddered.
 “How many does he command?” he asked.

“Are we stuck here?” “Not unless you know a way to grow wings with nothing but dirt.” I stood up and tried to rake the dirt out of my hair.
 “We're stuck here.” Seth sighed in frustration and brushed his blue  hair.
 He fluffed it up but the dirt was still stuck in globs.
 I rolled my eyes at his attempts.
 I turned around to see an entrance.
 I walked over and bent down.
 There seemed to be some kind of sign or symbol.
 It was two circles with a sword through the center of both.
 “Seth, look!” I said and pointed to it.
 He came over and bent down, tracing the sign with his finger.

Only Karak had remained, furious at the loss.
 Through it all, one single fact pulsed as an undeniable truth.
 “Velixar,” Harruq said, clutching Aurelia’s hands and sighing with a mixture of relief and terror.
 “He’s dead.
 I’m free.”
 Aurelia kissed his forehead as the half-orc drifted back to sleep, still overcome with his exhaustion.
 To her eyes, it seemed he slept far better than he had before.

More and more hands curled in, surrounding Dieredon and Sonowin in a magical maelstrom, yet still they came.
 “Fly, Sonowin,” the elf shouted.
 “Fly safe!”
 Dieredon leapt from Sonowin’s back, the blades on his bow gleaming.
 He fell through the air, the long spike on the bottom aimed directly for Velixar’s head.
 “Master!” Qurrah shouted again, shoving his body against Velixar’s.
 His concentration broken, Velixar lost his control of the black fog.
 The darkness swirled inward as if Velixar were the center of a giant drain.
 The blackness filled him, surrounded him, and consumed him.
 When all returned, and Dieredon was about to land, a wave of pure sound and energy rippled outward.

There are no serious conflicts in the world today that cannot be resolved through consultation, consensus and ‘win-win’ formulas.
 Full Employment
 The fading spectre of nuclear annihilation gave way in the 1990s to the rising spectre of chronic unemployment.
 The end of the Cold War brought with it some wrenching transitions, among them the break-up of the USSR and Comecom, the reunification of Germany, the downsizing of defence manufacturers in America as the result of reduced orders for war materiel, the collapse of Japanese financial markets and onset of a decade-long recession, and displacement of millions of migrant Asian workers following the invasion of Kuwait and the first war in Iraq.
 These events violently disrupted expansion of the world economy and creation of employment opportunities for an expanding labour force in both industrialized and developing countries.
 Near panic levels of concern rippled across the world during this period about rising levels of joblessness, prompting one doomsday author to prophesize the ‘end of work’.
 The situation became particularly acute in developing countries, because of their predominately young populations and high population growth rates.
 Trends and Prospects
 ICPF refused to side with the pessimists who viewed unemployment as a terminal illness spreading rapidly through the entire world economic system.
 Its report presented evidence to dispel the twin myths that technological development and trade were net job destroyers.

Almost as though sensing my thoughts, Alec hugged me tightly and buried his chin in my hair.
 "I know you don't want to hear this, but it isn't too late for you to change your mind.
 Even now, it'd be a relatively simple thing to have you halfway across the country by the time the challenge actually occurs."
 The thought of what was coming filled me with dread, but I shook my head.
 As scary as all of this was, I knew flying away and never knowing what'd happened would be worse.
 Alec was probably going to die, and all of the rest of us with him, but if he didn't, if the pack somehow managed to survive the coming crisis, I wanted to be there.
 Alec was more than capable of sending me away and then never letting me know he'd survived.
 There was a constant war inside him over what to do with me and I couldn't afford to give up my one advantage.
 He seemed less able to contemplate cutting me out of his life when I was around.
 I planned on playing that card for all it was worth.

We'll be given an unknown weight, an unknown number of pulleys, and expected to move it all with the most efficient arrangement possible."
 It almost didn't seem like he was talking to me.
 There was no emotion in his voice, no gentle teasing; he didn't even meet my eyes.
 I sat down with a slight hope that he'd thaw out a little by the time class ended, only to shake my head in disbelief when the bell finally rang and proved me irrevocably wrong.
 Maybe he'd go back to normal after a few days.
 There really wasn't any way to know though.
 I didn't even know what'd brought on the sudden change.
 Was he really just angry I'd overheard Jasmin threaten Lucy?
 Why did I even care?
 Spanish dragged by at a snail's pace, but somehow before I knew it, I was walking with Britney towards the tutor lab.

There is no need to be in such a... rush to ask questions.” “Van’dret doesn’t play your word games with me, you know, and I know that this is not a normal disappearance.
 Not with one of the great cosmic alignments coming in such a short time.
 Neither of us would be surprised if Taiga had killed him and taken his place.
 But, then he would simply have called a concave and be elected Guild Master if that was the case.” “You’re not suggesting that Taiga is involved in some foul play against the Grand Master are you?” asked Van’dret his tone equally outraged and surprised.
 Gracella almost physically jumped at the suggestion and could not help herself from a quick glance around the hall before responding.
 “I don’t think Taiga has any interest in becoming Guild Master, or he would be Guild Master.
 I am just concerned about Master Oreintvenir.” She said.
 “I think the Guild Master can take care of himself just fine, for all we know he quietly ascended and is in the Celestial Heavens laughing at us now.” Gracella nodded, but Van’dret knew her thoughts were the same as any Immortalist at the conversation of Ascension to the Celestial Realm.
 If you succeeded people would know a new God walked the Heavens.
 If you failed the ceremony the only sign would be silence.

 I waited and finally said, “Well, do you know what it is?” Seth dropped his finger.
 “It means, 'slayer of worlds'.
 Does that ring a bell?” “How do you know that?” I asked.
 He shrugged.
 “I don't know how, I just do.
 Maybe that's my power.” “Well, I want to go this way,” I said and pointed to the entrance.

Qurrah followed Velixar’s gaze, and there in the distance he saw many white objects faintly illuminated by the stars.
 “About a hundred,” Qurrah said.
 “But what are they?”
 “Elves,” the man in black said.
 “And I know who leads them.
 Prepare yourself, my disciple.
 I have erred, and now we pay the price.”
 Qurrah nodded, then closed his eyes and rehearsed the spells he knew.
 They were weak compared to his master’s but they would claim a few lives.
 His whip curled around his arm, ready for more bloodshed.

Too many homes were aflame.
 They could no longer cower within them and hope to be spared.
 In the commotion, Qurrah vanished, unseen and uncared for.
 He had spent his whole life disappearing in crowds, and in the dark of night, surrounded by fear and worry, he was just a shadow.

 Qurrah was in no hurry as he left the city behind.
 The grass was soft and tall, and it felt good under his feet after so much sprinting down stone roads.
 Stars filled the sky, and he smiled to them often.
 In the distance, he spotted a small fire, and he knew to whom it belonged.

“I went and chatted with him,” she continued “and he hates the Immortalists, but is rather unpleasant and needs to take a bath.
 But he is also clearly very honorable.
 And when I asked him why he wanted to be a knight…” she paused then added, “he said that some ‘Infernally damned knights’ have to stand up and fight.” “So you think he is a good man?” Rodregas asked.
 “I think Geriodon is a ‘holier than thou’ stick in the mud, who needs to learn to bathe and not mumble when he speaks.
 And yes, he is probably one of the only men here that actually deserves knighthood.” Rodregas nodded and said, “What about Nordien?” “Nordien is the polar opposite to Geriodon; smooth and friendly… and tried to have sex with me within our first conversation, which was also the only decent thing he said during our conversation.
 He seems to really dislike Geriodon and Karun.
 He comes from a strong blood line and rich family and feels he should already be a knight and not be forced to be in the tournament.” “So, why is Nordien in the tournament and not knighted?” Rodregas asked.
 “From what I can gather, Nordien is very friendly with the Immortalists, including the Ambassador Van’dret, and most people believe that he only wants to be knighted so that he can then leave the knighthood and join the Immortal Guard.” Rodregas nodded.
 That was not too surprising; since such ex-knights are usually made officers.
 Greater sigils were much more rare in the Guard than the knighthood, not to mention the officers of the Immortal Guard lived in much nicer style than the knighthood.

“Feeling okay?” I remembered I was going to ask her something.
 I said, “Mm-hmm,” and got lost in the hum of my reply.
 She smiled at my satisfied trance.
 I faded off to blackness then, though my dreams were vivid and wild.
 I was a hawk, flying high above the mountain.
 My wings stretched as I soared through an endless and open sky.
 Through keen eyes I watched below, surveying a massive structure of dark stones.
 Then I was a wolf, running through those stones, hunting, searching, protecting.
 My muscular shoulders tensed and released with each long stride.
 I was myself again, though strong and confident.

He didn’t reply to me because he had spotted Emily.
 She was slowly backing up with her palms out.
 Fire danced from her fingertips and twisted towards the troll and frost beast.
 The beast breathed and ice sprayed from its mouth.
 Emily moved her hand over and the ice evaporated into mist.
 She was holding up fine but I didn’t know how much longer.
 I strung my bow and released an arrow.
 It pierced the frost beast’s pelt and it fell to the ground.
 Emily turned to me with huge, confused eyes.
 She mouthed the words, thank you.

"The brothers watched the dayborn for many turnings, but although they learned many things, they found themselves unable to learn the dayborns' language.
 Even worse, the dayborn hunters were becoming ever more skilled at tracking Inock, and they began to press him sorely."
 I felt as though I was drifting.
 The bed no longer mattered, or even seemed to exist.
 All that mattered was the story and the warm drowsiness that increased with each breath.
 "Adjam saw his brother's frustration grow, but he never suspected just how strong it'd become until two hunters brought Inock to bay, and he turned on them.
 Inock killed the first hunter and would have done likewise to the second, but Adjam sprang upon his brother, knocking him away before the second man could be harmed."
 Alec's fingers slowly caressed my stomach as he spoke.
 It should have tickled, but instead it lulled me even further towards oblivion.
 "And thereby the full effect of the Earth's curse was felt.

Scraped and bruised all over, he went home with Carol, who lived nearby.
 Her parents were gone.
 Whatever they did that afternoon, Eric wouldn’t say.
 But something went wrong, and it sent him into a funk so deep, he gave up the job and asked did I want to go camping up the coast.
 We borrowed surfboards, drove to San Onofre, and pitched a tent on the cliffs.
 Between our assaults on the surf, I told Eric stories about my exploits in Pacific Beach.
 Though he chuckled about my status as top dog, he said, “I hope you know that’s not what being Superman’s about?” “Aw, give me a little credit, will you?” I snapped, annoyed that he had seen through me.
 I got more than friendly with Gloria Valenciana, who was down from Los Angeles camping with her family.
 Her dad made her turn in early.
 When I joined Eric at our campfire, I asked him why he didn’t seem interested in girls.

Art – Nothing, they’re just not really all that deadly.
 I mean what a misnomer, they’re only five feet high at their tallest, and for the most part they only stand two or three feet in height.
 And then they don’t exactly qualify as cliffs with their gentle incline and all.
 I wonder what idiot was allowed to name them cliffs in the first place, Don Quixote?
 Jim – They’re the best we have.
 Art – Well they’re not good enough for our purpose, so we might as well not even bother with that option.
 Jim – Good thing school is starting again soon.
 Art – That’s all fine and good for you, you get to leave town, but I have to stay with the boy.
 Jim – Eugene will be going back to school too, so hopefully Johnny will be easier to live with.
 Art – Maybe he will, and maybe the sun will fall from the sky and strike me dead.

Even Rachel's frequent teasing hadn't ever managed to crack his 'working face'.
 "I hardly think that would be the case.
 While you may very well have lost your way, it would have been a small matter for one of the others to track you down.
 You have, if I may say so, a very distinctive smell.
 It reminds me of a type of sage brush that hasn't grown here in quite some time."
 His sigh was more felt than heard, and it put me in mind of mountains, redwoods, and other ancient things.
 "Donovan, can I ask you a question?"
 "Of course, mistress.
 I'm afraid there are many which I won't be able to answer, but it would be a delight to share those things which haven't been forbidden me."
 "You're really old, aren't you?"

I drew in ragged breaths as I cleaned her face.
 I wiped her eyes and they came open, an unbelievable shade of dark green, sparkling like emeralds.
 She was a beauty.
 I wasn’t aware the room had grown silent until I wiped her ears and heard my own gasp.
 They were slightly rounded at the tips… almost blunt.
 I realized I had stopped breathing as I read, so engrossed in the story.
 I reached up absentmindedly to stroke the tops of my ears.
 I looked up then, at the elders who surrounded me.
 Their faces were astonished.
 “She is… human,” they said.

 You want to go home with me after the shift?
 If he’s still hanging around, maybe you can chase him off.” By now, Helga was wringing her hands.
 Her eyes had misted over.
 She was about as bright as the girls in blonde jokes.
 But she was a darling, generous and kind.
 So when she invited us to a Billy Graham crusade, to keep from disappointing her, and maybe for deeper reasons, I said “Why not?” Neither Cliff nor I admitted we might want to attend.
 We decided we could read a newspaper account and tell Helga we had gone and found plenty to think about.
 But by the evening of the crusade, something like conscience bit us.
 The crusade was downtown at Balboa Stadium, where the Chargers played.

Free and well-developed media are vital to democratization and development.
 For this very reason, the dissemination of information by the media carries with it a great responsibility that cannot be effectively shouldered where private profit is the sole motive, or government control limits freedom of expression.
 The media can play an invaluable role in disseminating relevant information to the public, but the type and quality of information being carried in most developing countries must be radically improved.
 The worldwide tendency to focus on the immediate and dramatic at the expense of that which could make a substantial and lasting contribution to development requires greater efforts to creatively present socially useful information in an easily accessible and interesting form.
 Information in developing countries
 In the industrial democracies there are usually multiple sources of independent information available to the public on most issues.
 The same is not the case in developing countries, where very often the sole source of information is government – which lacks credibility because the quality of information is poor or it is politically motivated – or academic institutions that are insulated from practical, especially commercial, realities.
 The need is especially great for broadcasting value-added information at the local level.
 Specialized agencies should be established in developing countries in the form of public foundations or independent research institutions to provide a credible, unbiased source of information by identifying critical gaps in public awareness needed to stimulate development in various fields; conducting studies to document proven practices in agriculture, business, education, health, government, media; disseminating information on new opportunities; commissioning films, novels, short stories and syndicated columns to communicate developmental information; supporting pioneering examples of new or improved activities in different fields; encouraging others to imitate successful pioneers; recognizing and rewarding high achievers.
 A modest investment in new institutions to disseminate information can have an impact comparable to that of the information superhighways being heralded in the most industrially advanced nations – accelerating adoption of new activities, magnifying response to government programmes, and doubling the total developmental achievements of a country over the next five years.

But I do have one other Black Yew bow and a bigger sword that probably makes more sense for you to use than me, since I have used nothing but short swords for a very long time.” Rodregas then pulled out the two-handed great sword that he had found at the keep and handed it to Doi’van.
 On Doi’van it was more a hand and a half sword, but as he flourished it around a bit, Rodregas could see he was pleased.
 “The steel is simple, but the balance is good.
 I am starting to be very happy that I helped pull this wagon up the hill,” he said with a deep chuckle, which sounded like distant thunder.
 Rodregas nodded and said, “I am afraid other than a few items to sell everything else is food and blankets for us... and the horses and tools that I stripped out of the Raven Keep.
 I figured I would need the tools to fix this place up and make it livable.” Rodregas continued, “It is dark and late.
 Let’s make camp in here.
 In the morning we can start seeing about getting this farm in order.” With that they all worked together to get the barn organized and clean.
 There was no more talking, each had plenty of their own thoughts to mull over.
 Rodregas was feeling pretty good at the moment, dangerously positive.

I have truly come to care for both of you.
 I have met few men of such character and willingness to take on the Guild of the Celestial Path and all their power.” She continued, “I want to be with you.
 I want to share this journey, but I am not a warrior.
 And the two of you were so close to dying on me, and next time I might not be able to save you and you might die…,” she paused.
 “I could handle dying, but I am not sure I could handle having you die in my arms.” “Imeralda,” said Doi’van, “we must all walk our own paths.
 Rodregas and I have made a choice, we will fight.
 Whether the Gods are on our side or not, we will fight.
 You need to find your own path; you are talented and young and have the world at your feet.
 We cherish the time that you joined us.” Rodregas nodded, Doi’van’s words had captured his own thoughts.
 He was no boy to put his own needs over another.

More and more hands curled in, surrounding Dieredon and Sonowin in a magical maelstrom, yet still they came.
 “Fly, Sonowin,” the elf shouted.
 “Fly safe!”
 Dieredon leapt from Sonowin’s back, the blades on his bow gleaming.
 He fell through the air, the long spike on the bottom aimed directly for Velixar’s head.
 “Master!” Qurrah shouted again, shoving his body against Velixar’s.
 His concentration broken, Velixar lost his control of the black fog.
 The darkness swirled inward as if Velixar were the center of a giant drain.
 The blackness filled him, surrounded him, and consumed him.
 When all returned, and Dieredon was about to land, a wave of pure sound and energy rippled outward.

She'd been in the garden for 20 minutes.
 It was foggier than usual--was that an indication that there'd be a door or window or whatever back to 1927?
 Now that he'd told her he loved her, had opened his heart to her completely, he couldn't bear the thought that she might not walk back into his arms.
 So when he at last saw her moving through the fog, he ran to snatch her up.
 "Marie," he sighed into her hair.
 She could barely breathe but didn't want to be released.
 When he at last set her down, she continued to cling to him.
 "I wish you didn't have to go to work today."
 He was surprised by her words.
 "Do you want me to call in sick?"

“We should get moving and find somewhere else to stay.
 If we stay and argue in the forest, something worse is bound to find us.” “Right, lead the way,” I said and pushed off the tree.
 Seth nodded and I walked beside him as he led us, once again, through the woods.
 Emily and Jason were talking quietly about something which gave us both the opportunity to talk.
 “You think Kojas sent them?” I mumbled to him and pushed a branch away.
 He looked at me from the corner of his eye.
 “Obviously, why else would they say that the 'King' would underestimate them?” “You make a good point,” I said.
 “Why did the syphon attack you?” I lowered my voice so only he could hear me.
 “I thought you said they wouldn't attack you.” He looked uneasy.
 “The syphon said he would be rewarded for grabbing me.

With a sharp tearing sound, Alec's right hand elongated into the viciously clawed weapon of his hybrid form.
 It shredded the comforter and mattress just a few inches from my head.
 I gave him my best lop-sided smile and kissed his arm.
 "You're not going to scare me off with cheap tricks.
 This is important."
 His eyes were an intense blue, paler than normal.
 They were Alec's eyes, but they were also the eyes of his beast, and I suddenly realized the dominance stuff wasn't just a game.
 There was a feral part of Alec that didn't play well with others, that would kill or be killed in turn rather than have his will thwarted.
 A complex collage of emotions flooded through my system as I tried to process what that meant, and whether or not I needed to be scared.
 As suddenly as it'd changed before, Alec's fist relaxed, shrinking back into its normal size and shape like melting snow.

Rodregas took off his harness and boots and grabbed the ridges of the bark.
 He had climbed walls where you stuck your toes in the crack left by old mortar worn away.
 The bark of the tree, like the rest of the tree, was on an epic scale and actually provided good leverage for climbing.
 He did not look at how high he had to go, but instead simply started to climb.
 The climb took far longer than he hoped and he could not see Imeralda as he climbed.
 He was finally getting close to the first of the branches of the tree when he heard Doi’van yell.
 “Rodregas, what in the name of the Celestial Winds are you doing?” He paused in his climb, his toes caught in the bark.
 Rodregas could feel the wetness of blood on his toes and he felt like he was going to slip at any moment.
 He breathed deep and yelled, “I am climbing the damn ‘One Tree,’ what does it look like?
 Now, shut up before I fall.”  He continued his climb, finally reaching a branch.

It could've been taken as the worst kind of insensitivity; Mallory just gave my hand another squeeze.
 "He hasn't always been crippled.
 In fact he used to be a delightful dancer.
 His injuries were sustained at the hands of the individuals who killed Alec's father, the same ones who wanted to kill me, and who tortured Donovan for days before finally accepting that I'd died from the wounds that left me like this."
 Mallory shrugged, slowly and painfully in response to my questioning look.
 "My scars aren't readily visible, but they're there.
 That's why Alec is forced to come move the food he has sent to me.
 The scar tissue built up around my heart tends to pull in painful ways when my pulse starts racing.
 I tend not to worry about it all that much, but Alec fears it's a sign of deeper problems.
 I generally humor him and leave the heavy lifting for his visits, and we both pretend he doesn't know about the small garden I keep in a nearby cave."

 Who didn’t like it?
 CM:  	Um, well, let’s see, in Sum Times, the review said, “’Goodbye to the Shell’ is the kind of self-satisfied soft-rock that John Denver would be proud of.
 If Gardner hates his past so much why can’t he leave it behind?
 Why does he write, ‘Adult us, be real, don't frighten or gull us, Honest Merchant, Home, Bluff City.’?
 Buddy Gardner, Memphis don’t need you around no more.”

His stance was similar to Rodregas’ own.
 Rodregas went slowly but steadily, keeping his guard up.
 The boy kept his hands up.
 When Rodregas went in low he took the blows to his body and went for Rodregas’ face.
 Against another opponent it was the right move.
 Unfortunately for the boy, his blow seemed to come at Rodregas slowly.
 Rodregas easily dodged as he landed a strong blow to his opponent’s chest.
 Rodregas was used to sparring with Doi’van and was surprised when his opponent went flying into the line of contestants and did not get back up.
 Rodregas waited a moment and then looked at the knight who stood outside the match.
 The knight did not look as surprised at the quickness of the match as Rodregas.

An employment strategy which generates a large number of new jobs in the non-farm rural sector could contribute substantially to diversification of rural employment opportunities.
 A similar strategy has proved highly effective as an engine for growth in a number of East Asian countries, which employed crop-intensive and labour-intensive technologies to achieve increasing levels of employment and productivity in agriculture.
 Empirical evidence from these countries confirms that wherever agriculture becomes prosperous, labour becomes scarce.
 Between 1952 and 1968, land reform in Taiwan increased the number of cultivators five-fold, leading to dramatic increases in output and productivity, a shift from foodgrains to higher value-added fruit and vegetable crops, and the creation of more than 100,000 jobs in post-harvest and processing activities.
 These changes in employment led to enhanced rural incomes and purchasing power, growing domestic demand for goods and services, including manufactured goods, and further job growth.
 Land reform in South Korea during the early 1950s increased the number of owner cultivators from 50 per cent to 90 per cent and led to a 4.7 per cent annual growth in labour productivity per hectare over a 15-year period.
 Then, as agricultural technology improved and industrialization gained momentum, the proportion of South Korea’s workforce engaged in agriculture fell from 55 per cent to under 16 per cent over the following three decades.
 Thailand, which has had the fastest growth of the East Asian economies in recent years and still employs 70 per cent of its workforce in agriculture, has also attained high rates of production and employment in the rural sector through diversification in agriculture from traditional cultivation of rice and rubber to high-value crops and agro-based industries.
 Economic Potential of Increasing Demand for Food and Agricultural Products
 There are powerful social forces active in the world today that can stimulate significantly greater growth in both food demand and food production.

You can’t get into an animal’s mind and make them behave the way you want them to.” “But the dogs… wolves… follow them.
 They had them do a demonstration and—” “No, Frey.
 The wolves do not follow the elves.
 The wolves protect them by choice.” “By choice?” “Yes.
 And I have seen them tear an elf apart as quickly as defend them.” I shivered.
 “Rhys and Rider were saved by the wolves once.
 They think the animals understand.
 They follow the wolves, you see.
 That is why they are here.” We topped the ridge, jagged rock and loose dirt shifting beneath our feet, and Ruby dropped the quiver by the edge before climbing down with a deftness I had yet to master.
 Steed, Anvil, and Grey greeted us before we resumed training.

Satisfied, he went back around and placed it against the wall.
 He was about to go back for a second when torchlight flooded the alley.
 “Move and you’ll find an arrow in your throat,” said a voice.
 “Pincushion him anyway,” urged another.
 Harruq held a hand before his eyes, cursing his awful luck.
 He saw two figures, night patrolmen, and both human.
 One had a readied bow aimed at his neck.
 “I haven’t done anything wrong,” Harruq said.
 “Sure you haven’t,” one of the patrolmen said.
 “Then what’s with the crate?”

We can’t trust you either.” I pointed out, crossing my arms.
 “Arming you is as scary as giving a kindergartener a knife.” She gasped.
 “Yeah, well, I’m ignoring you now.” She huffed and turned around.
 “There you are!” Jason exclaimed as he crashed out of the trees, panting.
 His wavy hair was a deep red that framed his eyes but he didn’t seem to have noticed its color change or to care.
 He was wearing an all black layered tunic and pants with boots that looked as light as mine.
 If I didn’t know it was Jason, I would have taken a huge step backwards at his assassin-like appearance.
 “What’s going on?” he demanded, eyes flickering from each of us as he took in all of our strange appearances.
 “Don’t know Jason, we’re as stumped as you.” I said.
 He bit his lip and then smirked.

Decades of freedom and education were needed for the country to outgrow a sense of inferiority, a seeking for security, a feeling of submissiveness and complacency, and to acquire a sense of pride, ambition, high aspirations and expectations, a seeking for achievement, and a spirit of adventure and enterprise – and still the task is not complete.
 Development is like a chemical reaction that is determined by the variety and quantity of elements present and the conditions under which they are put together.
 If one essential element or condition is missing, a social transition like a chemical reaction may not take place at all.
 The absence of peace in war-torn Africa or democratic freedoms in former colonial nations, the absence of social stability or an entrepreneurial class, the absence of a functioning banking or educational system, the absence of the minimum necessary infrastructure for transportation and communication – any one of these may be enough to prevent transition until the deficit is made up.
 If even an inessential element or condition is missing, the process of transition may take much longer than would otherwise be necessary.
 Lack of information, lack of education, lack of necessary skills, lack of supportive laws or incentives or protection against losses – insufficiency in any of these areas may be enough to slow or delay the process of change by years or even decades.
 The world needs a coherent intellectual framework for understanding and dealing with radical transitions.
 High priority should be given to developing a fresh conceptual approach that is not en cumbered by allegiance to existing theories and systems.
 Transitions should be regarded as social transformations which depend on and result in corresponding changes in the political, economic and other spheres.
 Efforts to guide a multi-dimensional social transition through uni-dimensional strategies, particularly those limited to manipulation of macro-economic policy, are unlikely to yield the anticipated results.

They were surprised with visits by the two Dire Cats on a regular basis.
 The first evening, when they were settling into the night, the two cats casually walked through the door.
 The three of them froze while the two cats just sprawled out in casual comfort close to the fire.
 One of the cats (Rodregas had not been able to tell the two apart yet) stretched over and started to rub her chin against Rodregas’ leg.
 The power behind its head was such that it almost knocked him over.
 He had seen small house cats make similar gestures, but it was disconcerting to have two powerful predators such as the Dire Cats being so friendly.
 “I guess this means we are part of the pride,” said Imeralda, slowly reaching over and giving the other cat a tummy rub.
 Rodregas held his breath, as the cat responded with its paws by stretching out, its claws popping free with the stretch.
 They showed no signs of aggression, but just looking at the size of their claws, and then at Imeralda, made Rodregas want to jump over the Dire Cat and put his body in front of her.
 Rodregas was fully aware of how one swipe of those claws would likely kill her.

You will again.” I nodded.
 My nose was itchy.
 I wiggled it.
 “Rest now,” he said.
 “We have time.” I reached forward, ready to ask him to stay, but he wasn’t leaving.
 He only settled in.
 Both he and Ruby were staying with me.
 I was happy… downright blissful.
 Stupid dust.
 I watched Chevelle’s face as my eyes fluttered shut, exhausted.

 "Actually, it would probably be very valuable.
 You never see any money that old in circulation because coin collectors have it all.
 But you don't need any money.

 "No.
 I can't let you--" "Come on."
 He stood up, taking her hand.
 "It'll be payment for the history lesson."
 Marie exclaimed with excitement when she saw Faneuil Hall--she'd been there many times.

It was amazing how quickly I could forget his supernatural abilities.
 Most of the time he seemed so normal.
 If you could consider any gorgeous, well-built boy who happened to be interested in me normal.
 Every so often though he'd do something that should be impossible.
 Alec's smile was slightly apologetic.
 "Sorry about that.
 Would you like to listen as well?"
 My confusion earned me a chuckle.
 Alec reached over to the bedside table and picked up a remote that had more buttons on it than most laptops.
 A split second later piano music flooded the room through the myriad of speakers mounted on the ceiling.

Then the remaining three were upon the elves, and it was Felewen’s turn to kill.
 The first soldier to swing at her found his sword cut from his body, his hand still clutching it as it flew through the air.
 He cowered back, pulling his bleeding arm behind his shield.
 Another leapt forward to defend him.
 A longsword punched through his throat before he even saw her swing.
 Shock and panic took over, and then the wounded soldier turned to flee.
 The final human soldier smashed his shield forward, preventing Felewen from chasing.
 The slender fighter flipped backward, clutching her sword in both hands.
 She landed softly behind the sorceress.
 “Take him,” she said.

She was taller and red haired.
 But in her expression, I read the same message I got from Karen’s sweet face.
 It said, I’ve been hurt bad and know how it feels so I’ll be nice to everybody and try not to make anybody else feel that way.
 A thousand and some miles from home, I was lonely enough to once again ache for a best friend.
 So while I admired this barmaid, who looked about three months pregnant, I dreamed she and I would roam until we discovered the right small town, where we didn’t know anybody.
 There she could leave behind the sorrow of getting ditched by the creep who knocked her up.
 I meant to love her baby like my own.
 But on the third evening, not long after she had sat with me and chatted in a dovelike voice about strange and outrageous visitors to the bar, a guy with several tattoos came for her.
 As she walked out with him, she waved goodbye to me.
 Earlier that day, I had noticed a Kitchen Help Wanted sign in a coffee shop.

He'd definitely hesitated.
 It stretched out long enough that for a moment I didn't think he was going to answer, but then he nodded, a long deliberate motion that left no question but that it was a confirmation.
 I wanted to ask more, but didn't want to venture into the kinds of things that would get him in trouble with Alec.
 We walked for another minute or so before I was struck with the silliness of someone who was old enough to be my great grandfather calling me 'Mistress Paige.'
 "Donovan, you could just call me Adri if you want."
 "That would hardly be appropriate, mistress."
 "It just seems silly.
 I mean, I'm not really part of the family or anything, so there isn't really a need, is there?"
 Donovan's smile was incredibly gentle as he shook his head in disagreement.
 "You're very much a part of the family, and if I may be so bold, I'm quite delighted by your inclusion.

They banked around, still in perfect formation, and then dove again.
 “Kill them now!” he ordered, his fingers crooking into strange shapes.
 “ _Hemorrhage!_ ” Qurrah hissed, pointing at the nearest horse.
 Blood ruptured from the beautiful creature’s neck.
 The rider steadied her best he could, knowing his doom approached.
 They crashed into the inky blackness, crushing bodies underneath before the swarming dead tore them to pieces.
 Velixar’s first attack was far more impressive.
 Bits of bone ripped out from his undead army; femurs, fingers, ribs, and teeth flew into the sky in a deadly assault.
 The elves broke formation as the barrage approached.
 The first ten, however, were too close to have hope.

It seemed to be helping, so I closed my eyes and relaxed.
 The water started to chill several times, but I was hesitant to get out.
 At the risk of boiling myself, I eased the magic I’d been using to reheat the bath.
 Finally, I felt well enough to stand.
 I picked up one of the soaps and washed quickly, then pulled the water from the tub to rinse the suds away.
 I’d not had much opportunity to practice with water; I added it to the list of things to work on.
 It had been a long journey, and the bath was refreshing.
 The soap left a light fragrance in the air, smelling like morning and cold, and I wondered if the fairy dust was still affecting me.
 I dried off and dressed in the clothes Ruby had put out for me.
 They were a little snug, but not enough to have been her castoffs.

I hurriedly scanned through, getting caught on a section marked Exchange.
 It claimed using magic consumed a person’s energy.
 Not just immediately available energy, but life energy.
 I’d never known a book to lie, but I couldn’t imagine its applications otherwise.
 Ruby was giving part of her existence to draw me a bath?
 Chevelle and Steed forfeited time for a silly instructional match?
 It couldn’t have been right.
 I tried to recall, though still clouded with fog, the magic I’d seen in the village.
 The youngsters played, careless with the use, often until they collapsed from exhaustion.
 But the elders, they were reserved.

“So where will we go?” he asked.
 “Where else is there?” Qurrah said.
 “Perhaps we were meant to go to Woodhaven.
 The journey will not be long, perhaps a week or two at most.
 There are enough animals about for me to kill, so do not worry about food.
 As for water, there are many small streams, and we can beg from the occasional farms we pass.
 We were to leave anyway, now we do so sooner.”
 “Sooner?” Harruq said.
 “We paraded through the city like criminals and were tossed out with swords at our backs.
 If we were to leave, I wanted to leave on our own terms, not like that.”

I view Velixar as sort of a recruiter, the kind of man who’d be right at home at a Nazi rally filling confused kids with bigotry, anger, and murder.
 He is gone, for now anyway, and in The Cost of Betrayal these two brothers will get a chance to live on their own.
 For once Harruq has not only felt regret but done something about it.
 For once Qurrah has seen that the darkness he follows is not the absolute power it claims to be.
 This Half-Orc Series is a story of redemption.
 I will not tell it in just one book, not even in two or three.
 People will die, and I will break the hearts of my beloved creations.
 If you’ve read this far and enjoyed it, I welcome you to continue along with me, as well as thank you for your readership.
 Your time is precious, dear reader, and I couldn’t be happier knowing you spent it with me.

And now he knew that when she'd said that she couldn't do it, she hadn't been talking about making love with him but about marrying Davis.
 And if he made love to her, she'd feel tied to him and be more likely to stay.
 If he slowly increased the heat of his kisses and caresses, made her so hot that she stopped thinking altogether, made her so wild with desire .
 .
 .
 Rick closed his eyes, flushed with both desire and chagrin.
 He'd just told Marie he wouldn't do anything to hurt her.
 She was a virgin and planned to be one until her wedding night.
 How could he take that from her?
 How could he use an act of love to manipulate her into staying with him?

Viewed from another perspective, this gap represents a huge potential for the growth of agriculture, and through it for more rapid industrialization and job creation in developing countries, with rising exports from industrial nations.
 Rising incomes are accompanied by a diversification in diet which generates greater demand for wheat, meat and dairy products, fish, vegetables, fruits and processed foods.
 Projections for the year 2010 anticipate a 60 per cent increase in cereal consumption in developing countries, a 52 per cent increase in meat consumption, and a 69 per cent increase in milk consumption.
 Meat consumption in China has tripled since 1978 and is expected to more than double again over the next two decades.
 Sugar consumption in developing countries is currently less than half the average of industrial nations.
 In India, sugar consumption is projected to rise from 13 kg to more than 25 kg, generating a demand for a 100 per cent increase in sugar cane production, the establishment of 300 to 400 new sugar mills in the country and the creation of 3 to 4 million new jobs in this industry alone.
 Worldwide, raising the average level of sugar consumption in developing countries could generate tens of millions of additional jobs in agriculture, industry and services.
 Viewing the future demand for food from this perspective reveals a tremendous opportunity.
 Vast sections of humanity now aspire to the higher quantity, wider variety and greater nutritional content of food once consumed only by the wealthy.
 An effort to raise nutritional standards in the developing countries nearer to the levels prevalent among industrial countries will not only eradicate hunger, but also dramatically spur economic growth, employment, and purchasing power among the rural poor, stimulating growth of production and jobs in industry and services, as well as increasing exports and imports.

He can't let anyone close, for doing so would open him up to being hurt again, and there's no way he could survive another wounding.
 Meet the Saunders family, new to the neighborhood and teetering on the verge of bankruptcy.
 Mark, the father, talks a good story but is that all he is?
 His plan could hold the key to reversing his family's financial misfortunes, or it could wipe out everyone involved.
 Meet Chet, a battered old '64 Chevy pickup that was there on the night Charles' life imploded.
 For nearly three decades, he has been locked away in an old barn, safely out of sight if not completely out of mind.
 For 29 years Charles has blamed the old pickup for the destruction of his life, now he's about to find that the vehicle that destroyed his life might be the key to his healing and a journey of unexpected miracles.

She'd never be able to leave him once they'd made love.
 His mouth ravaged hers as he pressed her deeper into the cushions.

 "I love you, Rick."
 He froze.

"I doubt it.
 Of course, I would have bet my life that not even one girl from the past would walk into my garden."
 He glanced down at her again.
 "Why?
 Would that bother you?"
 "Yes."
 She'd become so accustomed to being honest with him that she didn't even think about dissimulating.
 "Why?"
 When she merely glanced up at him and quickened her pace, he caught her arm.
 "I'm sorry--don't be mad.

I would have remembered such a strangely innocent expression.
 Brandon's smile was one of the most genuine I'd ever seen, the kind of thing that only the most deceptive person could possibly pull off and not mean.
 Alec's smile was like the first bloom on a flower, something so new, so unpracticed that there wasn't any possible way it was anything other than sincere.
 It made me tingle all over, and want to giggle like I was still six.
 Several seconds passed before I realized I'd been unconsciously returning his smile.
 I felt a blush slowly rising past my throat, but I couldn't look away.
 Luckily the bell broke my strange fit of paralysis, and I was able to regain some of my composure while Mrs. Alexander struggled her way through the role.
 "I've been thinking about the fact that I didn't really give you young people a chance to ask any questions that might have come up during the course of your work on our section regarding light.
 Now's your chance, please ask away.
 If I don't know the answer, I'm sure that together we can find an adequate explanation for whatever you might have come across."

He reminded me of a teacher instructing a class.
 “First of all, once you enter, there is a chance that you won’t be able to leave for a while.” My heart fell at this.
 “Second, Igneeria is wild and offers little protection.
 Especially at a time like this.” He gave us a hard stare.
 “You might get seriously injured, or you might almost die.
 You must be ready for this.” I felt my stomach do sick flip-flops.
 I wasn’t ready.
 “Anyway,” the dwarf said quickly, obviously seeing our surprised faces, “I think all of you can deal with that.
 Shall we go?” Seth shrugged, “I guess.
 The answer to that question doesn’t really matter.” The dwarf held his hand out, “Shall we go then?” I shrugged, “Lead the way, shorty.” The dwarf gave me an annoyed look and walked towards the arch.

He could have shown her what her life would be like if she married him.
 But why couldn’t he just tell her what the article had said originally?
 She could draw her own conclusions about what the change in the article meant.
 Excited, he stood and headed for her room.
 But when he reached her door, he hesitated.
 Would she believe him about the article?
 She still felt loyal to that jerk, and she might not believe him.
 Especially since it was pretty obvious that he himself had something to gain by convincing her that she shouldn’t marry Davis.
 His sister had once told him that a girl usually wouldn’t even believe her best friend if she told her that her boyfriend was cheating on her.
 He went back to his office and read the article again.

Mrs. Tranton swallowed, twisting her hands.
 "Will you be going back to him?"
 Marie's eyes filled with tears.
 "No.
 I-I can't.
 My choice was to stay with him and never come home again or come home and never see him again."
 Mrs. Tranton couldn't suppress a sigh of relief as she hugged her daughter.
 "I'm sorry you can't have both, darling.
 But I'm so glad to have you home again."
 Marie went to her room to change clothes and lie down.

“But we were out of options and it was the only thing I could think of.” Then she added with more confidence, “Plus, while everyone knows a knight might learn a bit of magic, a sorcerer never learns to fight.
 They have servants for that.” The three shared a smile at that.
 Rodregas was very glad that he had insisted that she learn the fundamentals of blade work.
 “So what now?” he asked.
 “Now we go see if we can get some greater sigils,” said Doi’van.
 “We?” Rodregas asked.
 “And have you decided to take a greater sigil even it if cost you most of your magic?” Doi’van nodded and said, “Yes, I like to learn magic, but we are on a mission, one that is very important.
 The Immortalists, especially Taiga, must be stopped.
 If we are going to do that I will be of most use as a warrior.
 We have a powerful magic user,” he said with a smile.

In contrast, we view attitudes as one of the greatest of human resources, one that possesses a remarkable capacity for adaptation.
 Over the past two decades, we have witnessed and been parties to a radical change in attitudes of people, leaders and nations around the world regarding preservation of the environment.
 It would have been difficult to conceive in 1970 that, in spite of the myriad technological difficulties and powerful economic interests at stake, the entire world would make such a dramatic shift of attitude so quickly.
 This change was not brought about from above by enlightened leadership, but rather from below in response to a swelling tide of public awareness and concern, growing as a result of the work of countless individuals, voluntary agencies and research institutions projected through the media, confirmed by the findings of the UN World Commission on Environment and Development, embodied in the specific resolutions of the Earth Summit and in the growing body of environmental laws being adopted by every country, and now commonly incorporated in the educational curricula at every level.
 The changes called for in this report require changes of attitude of this magnitude.
 But no longer is it necessary for a great visionary leader to espouse a new attitude.
 The higher general levels of public education, the worldwide extension of the media and the active initiative of literally thousands of institutions serving the public interest can exert a powerful force for change, which sooner or later political leaders will accept and espouse.
 What is the shift in attitudes demanded to achieve global peace and prosperity?
 From a competitive, egocentric, state-centred attitude toward national security, that seeks to enhance security for some nations at the expense of the rest of the world, to an attitude of true global cooperation for collective human security.
 From demanding that other nations grant democratic rights to their people to a willingness to extend democratic principles to the governance of international institutions.

Sigil Warriors - Those who are born with magical talent but do not wish to be sorcerers have the opportunity inscribe a sigil on their magic talent that uses up a portion of their magical ability.
 Lesser sigils are simple such as health, strength, quickness.
 Greater Sigils are more complex and can mimic the powers of Celestial Beast or Infernal Daemons.
 Dire Beast - Are common mortal animals that have breed with either a celestial beast or an infernal daemon.
 Dire Beast who are of the Blood are direct descendent while, a regular dire beast will be several generation removed but still show signs of their ancestry.
 Night Bronze - a heavy armor usually only worn by warriors who are either part Celestial or are Hellborn or have a Sigil of Strength due to its heavy weight.
 The metal is highly magical and can hold powerful enchantments.
 Though very strong it does not hold an edge well and is seldom used to produce an edged weapon.
 Mithril - a silvery metal that is light in weight.
 It can be beaten like copper, and polished like glass; light and yet harder than tempered steel.

According to some mysterious cosmic whimsy or brutal plan, Eric had to die and I didn’t.
 So I filed the matter away with other mysteries, of which life offers plenty.
 But on this trip with all its remembering, I may solve the mystery.
 The End of Something Else
 A couple weeks after Eric's funeral, Cliff and I decided we should quit school and move to San Francisco.
 When school let out that day, we went up the street to La Mesa Junior High and found my mom grading papers on the patio behind her classroom.
 We told her our plans and listened while she recited all the reasons leaving now, three months short of graduation, was all wrong.
 She even tried to bribe us, offering to help with money if we would wait until June and apply to a San Francisco college.
 "Nope," I said.
 "If we wait, we probably won't go."

Don't worry; this is just a little setback.
 You'll see.
 Being in a different environment will do wonders for us both."
 I knew the rest of Mom's speech by heart, there was no reason to listen.
 Next she'd run through all of the famous, marginally well-known, or even really obscure photographers who got their start in the West.
 It didn't really matter.
 I waited the requisite fifteen minutes and then went back out to the U-Haul and got another box.
 Mom followed me out this time.
 I guess she was worried again.
 Even worries about school wouldn't cushion me now that I'd had an attack today.

My ears were ringing.
 There was something wet on my face.
 Tears?
 No, blood.
 My nose was bleeding.
 It took a moment to get my bearings.
 My bed sheets were a tangle and my clothes were disheveled.
 It must have been a dream.
 I had fallen asleep looking at my mother’s pendant, trying to remember her, and somehow combined it with the disaster I had read of the northern clans.
 It was only a dream.

 “It is quick, deadly, and strikes from nowhere.
 Listen to these words very carefully.
 If you give it enough of your power, nary a soul can withstand the shock and blood loss.”

"Jefferson Tranton handpicked Davis Runyon, heir to the Runyon publishing empire, as a husband for his daughter.
 Chandler Runyon had sold the business when his son was 19 years old so that, in actuality, Davis Runyon was heir only to the family fortune and to the power of wealth, not to the power of position.
 Eager for such, he courted both the young woman and her father.
 Tranton and his son had had a falling out when the younger Tranton had begun his own company in 1925, and because he had disinherited his son, Tranton began grooming Runyon to run his company as well as to become his son-in-law.
 In February 1927 Runyon became vice president of the import/export enterprise, and seven months later he married Tranton's daughter.
 "The marriage was apparently an unhappy one.
 Marie, who had, in her youth, had a reputation as a vibrant, fun-loving, somewhat mischievous girl, was rarely seen in public after her marriage.
 Reports suggest that she was a victim of spousal abuse.
 The official cause of her death in 1941 was an infection contracted during the birth of her youngest child.
 However, that child was born in 1936, so it is highly unlikely that she had a terminal infection for five years.

Now both peered around the corner, curious why such an exotic creature had arrived mere seconds before war.
 “Greetings, Dieredon,” the soldier hailed, pulling off his helmet.
 He was a middle-aged, blond-haired man who had numerous scars on his face.
 “Greetings to you as well, guard captain Antonil,” Dieredon said, taking a step back and kneeling.
 “Though I fear greetings is all I may offer you.”
 Antonil pointed to the wall, and he asked something which neither could hear when the orc army shouted another communal roar.
 “The Ekreissar will not aid you,” Dieredon said when the noise died.
 He shook his head, and a bit of sadness crossed his face.
 “We have been forbidden.
 Ceredon insists this is a minor skirmish, nothing more.

"I'm glad I'm the first."
 He glanced at her left hand.
 She'd taken off her engagement ring yesterday before they'd left for the shore, and she hadn't put it back on last night.
 She wasn't wearing it this morning, either.
 He wondered if she realized it but decided not to ask her.
 Setting his cup down, he said, "How would you like another new experience?"
 She smiled in delight.
 "What?"
 "Washing my car."
 Her face fell.

It was crazy to be scared that Alec had somehow missed someone, but I couldn't shake the feeling I was being watched.
 Once I finally made it upstairs, I checked both rooms, and the bathroom, before finally relaxing a little.
 I showered quickly, carefully making sure the smell of alcohol and cigarette smoke was out of my hair, and then changed into clean clothes and collapsed onto my bed.
 I was exhausted, but I couldn't fall asleep.
 Every time I closed my eyes, I saw dark shapes hurtling towards me.
 After looking at the clock for the thousandth time, I finally got up and went downstairs.
 The lights were still blazing, just as I'd left them.
 I debated for several seconds before opening the door and stepping out into the darkness.
 Somehow the porch light didn't reach out as far into the yard as I'd remembered.
 Alec appeared on the edge of the light with such suddenness that a startled yelp escaped me despite my best efforts.

 He chuckled at his own joke.
 "You want to marry my daughter."
 "Yes, sir."
 He reached into the inside pocket of his jacket.
 "I bought this two weeks ago."
 He handed Jefferson a small box.
 The older man opened it.
 "Lovely, lovely."
 It was a large sapphire encircled by tiny diamonds.

Chevelle came in and Ruby greeted him.
 “It’s fantastic,” she breathed.
 He smiled at her.
 Steed was following.
 “Almost unbelievable,” he added, shooting me a look.
 They turned to me as Rhys and Rider entered.
 They didn’t approach but stopped just inside the room and dipped into a bow.
 “Our gratitude, Elfreda.” I blushed.
 I had forgotten the wolves.
 They must have found them.

A raucous sound traveled up to us and Chevelle waved a hand, his magic bringing the hood of my cloak up to cover my head and then his own.
 At once, my stomach was a knot again.
 We rode into town at a walk; Chevelle was sitting straight and tall in his saddle but his arm hung casually, hand resting on his leg.
 I was more comfortable watching him, looking for a reaction, than the passing elves.
 Two men walked by in the opposite direction, their dark eyes on us.
 My cape blew back, exposing the shape of my leg, and they hissed indecent comments.
 I gasped, shocked, and my horse picked up its pace to ride beside Chevelle.
 Chevelle held up two fingers slightly to silence me.
 We hadn’t ridden more than a quarter of the way into town when he turned the horses to a medium-sized structure, stopping before a water trough.
 He dismounted effortlessly and pulled me from my horse and into the building in a few quick steps, closing the door behind us.

I forced a chuckle.
 "Please, Mom.
 Where else would I be?
 Saturdays are one of my only two chances all week to actually sleep in.
 It isn't like I'm going to climb out of bed at the crack of dawn and go hiking or something."
 Mom's chuckle was almost genuine.
 If Alec hadn't implied she was going to suspect I'd been up to no good, I probably wouldn't have even noticed how off she sounded.
 "You're right, dear.
 I shouldn't have doubted you.
 I just had a few kids come hiking past this morning talking about this massive party the entire school was at last night.

I shouldn't have been surprised by the question, but I was.
 Possibly because I'd spent too much time around people like Britney who were so caught up in their own lives that they didn't really care about what was happening in mine.
 "Les Misérables.
 The music from the musical is so inspiring that I know the book must be truly wonderful."
 I let the statement hang in the air for a couple of seconds, and then finished up with the truth.
 "Of course I don't really know, because it's so big, and parts of it are so boring, that I may never manage to get through the whole thing."
 Chapter 10 The rest of the afternoon finished up on a quiet note.
 After I went back to my table, Rachel worked on some homework for a few more minutes, and then gathered up her things and slipped out.
 I decided the new guy wasn't a football player when he started gathering up his books.
 No athlete in my experience ever took that many books anywhere.

Tears trickled down his face.
 He felt the anger growing inside him, but he forced it down.
 In his mind’s eye, he saw Velixar.
 The old prophet warned of death, retribution, and pain, but Harruq silenced him.
 Let the gift be gone.
 He denied the darkness within him.
 If this was betrayal, then so be it.
 He would pay the cost.
 Great spasms racked his body.
 All the power Velixar had granted him fled.

I looked over to find Rachel sitting in the middle of the seat, happily leaning forward so she could talk to us.
 "Yes, but so did everyone else.
 My chances are so dismal they're not even worth mentioning."
 Rachel looked like she was going to argue, or say something cheerful, but the back of my mind had been trying to figure out how she could be even with us, but still sitting in the back seat.
 I did a quick check to verify my suspicion.
 "Rachel, you should be wearing your seatbelt."
 "Why?
 It isn't like anyone is going to pull us over and give us a ticket."
 It was more difficult than I expected to formulate a coherent answer while fighting off the first quivering indications of another attack.
 "She's right, Rachel.

And it’s Skinny, Sumo Assassin’s sidekick is named Skinny.
 You also forgot about the sumo-mobile, anybody who drives a steam roller with a built in jet engine has my loyalty for life.
 Besides Skinny has great super abilities, he can slip into places that Sumo can’t go.
 Not to mention he’s a master of disguise, he can speak 12 languages fluently and women dig him because he is a master on the dance-floor.
 Eugene – The Sumo-mobile is just a cheap rip-off of the bat-mobile.
 The entire story is about a famous millionaire sumo wrestler turned vigilante.
 “Wrestling for the honor of the downtrodden.”  What the hell were they smoking when they came up with that one?
 And Twiggy?
 No chicks would ever like him, he weighs 50 pounds, chicks like guys with big muscles.
 Then there’s his hair, did he stick a finger in a light socket?

The sooner we get you caught up, the better off you'll be.
 Shall we say a month from today?"
 The prospect of trying to catch up, all the while needing to master new material and deal with a full schedule of other classes, was too much.
 I felt tears rising to the surface even as my heartbeat sped up to near-panic attack levels.
 That was the last thing I needed, but I could only fight off so many worries at once, and I was quickly approaching my limits.
 "Now don't come unglued on me.
 The school has set aside some discretionary funds for a math tutoring lab after school every day.
 We're not fully staffed yet, but if you swing by we should be able to help clear up any questions you might have.
 You'll have to do the majority of the work.
 I expect you to actually read your math book, but if you give it an honest effort I'm sure you'll be just fine."

 One sword came from above, aiming for her shoulder, while the other thrust low.
 The staff twirled, batting the thrust to one side.
 Aurelia spun, evading a downward strike slicing through the air by just an inch.
 She continued the turn, her staff whirling.
 The swords sliced, trying to block, but they were too slow.

 Liz – You’re impossible.
 Jim – Yep, and its hard work too.
 Speaking of art, when did you want to do my nude portrait?
 Liz – How about this weekend some time?
 Jim – Sounds good to me.
 What do you want me to wear?
 Liz – We’ll figure that out later.
 I’m working on a new technique.
 Jim – What sort of technique?

I thought I was carrying the country’s disease in me, this is what I said.
 They called it a sort of God complex.
 What was the word, dysphoria?
 Something like that.
 I was joyless—I was beyond joy.
 I think I presented them with a real interesting case, you know?
 I mean, one of the doctor’s I know, a young guy, a pretty hip cat, he knew my stuff.
 He wanted to talk about the music, nothing but the music.
 I mean, he was disguising it as a mental exam, but it was mostly curiosity, you know, I was the closest thing to a celebrity he’d ever treated.
 We talked about The Highsteppers, Sam the Sham, I mean, he knew them all, all the old blues guys even.

The latest stories I had heard about Thomas were that while at one point he had escalated his abuse to injecting heroin, he then attended a drug rehab center called Narconon, which had apparently enabled him to be clean for the last couple of years.
 If this was true, and he was clean, maybe he’d be a good person to go to for help?
 My mother thought so, and she insisted that we reach out to him.
 We were obviously reluctant and for good reason, but we were also desperate.
 My mother insisted that Thomas’s last rehab stint at Narconon had worked for Thomas and she knew he had strong ties there and perhaps he could get Brandon in for treatment.
 She told us that Thomas was doing work for the rehab in the form of interventions and getting drug addicts into treatment and that was what Brandon needed.
 But at what price?
 I wasn’t as worried about the financial price at this point, but rather the thought of owing Thomas after all that he had perpetrated against us was almost as unpalatable as Brandon’s Oxy addiction.
 This was all unchartered territory.
 It was all uncomfortable.

His burning eyes held no kindness when the man in black spoke.
 “Xelrak failed.
 Despite all the power I granted him, he failed.
 He tried to destroy the Council of Mages, but they destroyed him instead.” Velixar gave a greedy look at Qurrah.
 “He was but a starving boy when I found him.
 I gave him a name and lent him my power.
 It is how I have survived all these centuries.
 I do not risk my own life, choosing instead to give my power to others.
 I am the hilt, and my apprentice is the blade.

But a powerful Grimoire can quickly show you the shape and help you learn new spells in weeks, instead of years.
 “Also, sorcerers, like all people, learn in different ways.
 Some can quickly grasp a written idea where others will struggle to learn from a book.
 Or, a magician who is also a gifted musician will understand the flow and pace of the spell much better, like a piece of music.
 The most powerful Grimoires have had multiple users who are very different in their learning styles.
 Books like these will allow you not to just learn the spells the best way for you, but in a much deeper, complex way.
 Spells learned this way can be much more powerful than spells learned from either a regular book or the oral traditions.” “How powerful and complex do you think the books we have are?” Rodregas asked.
 Imeralda smiled and seemed hesitant before saying, “I have no idea.
 I have touched Grimoires, but I have never been allowed to read one before.” “Really?” Rodregas answered in surprise.
 “Well, looks like we are going to have to start using these books,” he said.

“Beware of the shadows.” “What?” I said, startled.
 “I know how scary shadows are and I don't need you to tell me that.” “Jazell...” “That's it,” I said angrily.
 “I'm getting an answer for once.” I ran towards the voice, which was hard because it sounded like it was everywhere.
 A bright light flashed and I saw a ghost-like girl disappear in the darkness.
 My eyes widened as I saw Seth and then darkness.
 But not before the voice said one more thing.
 “Beware of each other.” *** I opened my eyes and shot up so fast my head collided with Seth's.
 I clutched my head and said, “Ow.” Seth stretched his arm to rub his eyes.
 “What's wrong?” he asked.
 I shook my head.

 Jittery, she stopped to try to get her bearings.
 She couldn't have gotten lost in her own garden!
 She'd just gotten turned around.
 Listening carefully, she could detect the sound of splashing water.
 So the pond must be over that way .

 although she didn't know why there would be splashing.

“Uh okay…” I said slowly.
 She giggled, “Wow I never thought I’d scare a bunch of half-lings but I guess I did.” “You didn’t scare me,” Jason said quickly.
 “Yeah okay, Jason,” Emily said sarcastically.
 I sat up and leaned on Seth because I would fall if I didn’t, and Emily and Jason were too busy giving each other looks to help me.
 “What and who are you?” I stared at her.
 She rolled her eyes, “A light pixie, duh.” I blinked, “A light pixie?” “Yes, a light pixie.
 Are you deaf?” she retorted.
 “Uh, no, I’m not.
 I don’t know what a light pixie is or why you saved my life, but thank you” I said, trying not to snap back.
 “Well you are a half-ling and we need as many of them as we can get,” She pointed out.

She was going to Hollywood!
 She wouldn't be able to see Mary Pickford or Douglas Fairbanks, but maybe she'd see some of her new favorites, like Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts.
 She managed to doze a little but was wide awake before dawn.
 Deciding to do an aerobics tape until it was light enough to walk in the garden, she put on her workout clothes and went downstairs.
 She didn't know how she was going to be able to wait two entire days.
 She was so excited that she felt like she could run all the way to Hollywood.
 After 45 minutes of aerobics, she still wasn't tired!
 She wouldn't be able to sit still and watch TV today.
 She'd do all their laundry and clean the house from top to bottom and have dinner ready when Rick got home.
 She glanced at her watch and decided to get everything ready for breakfast so that it wouldn't take long to cook it for Rick as soon as they got back from her walk.

"Let's go."
 I shook my head.
 "I told Mrs. Campbell I'd stay the whole time.
 I'm not lying for you or anyone else."
 Rachel piped up unexpectedly.
 "It's okay, Britney.
 If you want to leave we'll give her a ride home."
 I could see the wheels turning in her head.
 If I really did have a ride, she could leave without ruining things with Brandon; but if I wasn't going to lie, then there was a good chance that Mrs. Campbell would find out she'd left early.
 Parents were relatively easy to fool.

Damn, she could ball.
 And, I was, I thought, in love, for only the really second time in my life.
 I wasn’t thinking, like, I gotta leave Lor, it’s gonna be painful, I want to be with this woman, this white light.
 I wasn’t thinking, period.
 Anyway, Lor knows all this—it’s cool, it’s cool.
 Lorelei, you gotta understand, is amazing, she’s like so together, and she understands human nature and sees it for the shoddy stuff that it is, and she accepts everything, man, like all human interaction is innocent, you dig?
 I mean, it hurt her, yeah, she’s human.
 But, she knew I wouldn’t do anything like this lightly.
 She knew it must have been some kind of deep cut for me to persist in it for, what, a couple weeks, a little longer.
 It took a while to get this angel out of my blood—it was like going for detox, you know?

I heard someone beside me and a flash of anger swept through me, lighting a flame at whoever it was.
 So maybe the fury wasn’t completely gone.
 I suddenly remembered the pages I had burnt in the briar patch so long ago.
 Burnt before I’d read them.
 My eyes flashed open.
 I sat up, ignoring my spinning head, but the book was already gone.
 I glared at Chevelle.
 It must have been dreadful, because he nodded and backed away, his mouth tight.
 “Oh, Frey.” Ruby’s voice was low and soothing.
 I grimaced as I turned to her, not at all wanting what I was about to say.

After I’m done, he will want them gone from all his lands, including here.”
 The man in black gestured to the city nestled against the forest.
 “This city has long been treated neutral, even though it resides within Neldar’s border.
 The elves will not take kindly to removal from a home many have lived in since before our dear king’s grandparents were alive.”
 “I eagerly await the bloodshed,” Qurrah said.
 He bowed to his master.
 “Go.
 The night is young.
 Taint the dreams of the slumbering.”
 Qurrah left Velixar to sit alone before the fire.

Blodeuwedd smiled at him, a smile that answered nothing but claimed to answer everything.
 The two continued to walk through the tall grass.
 After a few minutes she spoke, “The Gods and Daemon Lords are allowed to choose champions, but are not allowed to speak directly to any mortal.
 For this moment you are enough in the Celestial Realm for me to ask you a question: I don’t understand why you have chosen that.” As she spoke she raised her slim perfect arm and pointed at his shadow.
 He lowered his great head and studied the dark shape.
 The great lion had to admit the shadow was odd, slimmer than his great bulk, strangely dark in the day and the shadow’s eyes seem to glow the bright yellow color of flame.
 He shook his great head and mane as if to free it from the strange shadow, and growled, “You are a Goddess; you can see all.” Blodeuwedd nodded, she forgot to walk for a moment, as if in deep thought, but still she kept up with the Great Lion stalking through the grassland.
 “I can see all in our realm, and all in the mortal realm that is seen by one of our followers.
 I cannot see into the Infernal or Elemental Realms, and I think you have entered both.
 I do not know what this means.” The two continued through the grass for a few moments in silence.

Harruq kept going.
 He was used to harassment and verbal abuse from the guards.
 Once out of sight, though, he was usually out of mind.
 He relied on that as he turned a corner into the small space around their shed.
 Qurrah, who had been resting on the shallow grass, hurried to his feet at Harruq’s approach.
 “What is the matter?” he asked.
 “Nothing, but you might want to hide in there.
 Quick!”
 “I will do no such thing,” Qurrah said.
 “I said hey!” shouted the same man.

Not trusting my voice, I nodded and took the couple of steps needed to reach his passenger door.
 "I wanted to apologize for what happened earlier today.
 Cassie can be a real jerk sometimes."
 It was too good to be true.
 I almost looked over at him, but I knew I'd lose myself in a pair of soft, gray eyes.
 Brandon seemed to understand that my silence meant I wasn't convinced.
 "You wouldn't believe how relieved I was when you stepped forward and stopped her before things got out of hand."
 My natural pessimism reasserted itself, undaunted by the fact that I could just see Brandon's exquisitely-muscled arm out of the corner of my eye.
 "If you knew Cassie was in the wrong, why didn't you stop her?
 She's your friend; you should have been able to defuse the situation before it got that far."

He had started his own church somewhere out West.
 Something having to do with Jesus coming back and drop-kicking all the sinners into hell, with the help of the truly faithful of course.
 He was pretty much crazy.
 Johnny – And we’re related to him.
 Jim – Yes we are.
 Course it didn’t make him all that happy.
 That and he hated dad from the beginning because dad isn’t a religious person, and that dad had the audacity to question anything grandpa said.
 They didn’t get along at all.
 It’s amazing that mom and dad actually got married.
 He spent years trying to talk mom into out of dating dad, and finally he all but disowned her when they got married.

I screamed so loud that my ears felt like they were going to pop.
 We plummeted to the ground, falling closer and closer… Oh man, I thought and closed my eyes.
 Don’t look, don’t look, don’t look… “Really!” Seth yelled at the sky.
 “This brings new meaning to ‘things can’t get any worse!’” I gripped furiously to the limp dragon.
 I was falling to my death: so this is how it was going to end.
 I never pictured it this way; I thought I would die a little more heroically, not screaming like a little girl.
 “Not now Seth,” Emily screamed at him.
 “Everyone think!” “How can I think,” I screeched back, “when the ground is rushed towards me at full speed?” “I don’t know Jazell, just think if you want to live,” she said quickly.
 I let out another scream as my body tipped towards the edge of the dragon.
 I felt someone wrap their arm around me and I gave a grunt as I was pulled upright.

"Oh, yeah, because that's how things work."
 I'd only thought Britney was mad before.
 She was all but shaking with fury now.
 "Don't you get it?
 You, me, most of the rest of the school, we survive by staying neutral.
 For better or worse, we aren't attractive, cool, or rich enough to get in with Alec or Brandon.
 Once you piss one of them off though, you'd better hope you're in with the other one, because that's the only way you've got any kind of protection."
 It was starting to sound like organized crime or something.
 Of course they could make my life miserable socially, but it wasn't like they were going to really hurt me.
 I opened my mouth to try and calm Britney down, but she cut me off.

A vision, I believe, of what Cassady could have become had he overcome his demons.
 So, I sit on my porch and dream myself back to the morning when Cliff and I woke up in a Tijuana riverbed.
 Instead of what happened, I tell Cliff I’m going on the road to find Kerouac.
 Then I drive Route 66 and the turnpike from Chicago, 3000 miles to the Left Bank Bar in Lindenhurst, Long Island, where Bobby Casso introduces Jack and me.
 We talk about everything, including God and tequila, and at the right moment, I tell him about the light.
 His eyes open wider.
 Still in my dream, I'm back home when a postcard arrives, from Jack, who writes that he’s gone and found his daughter, Jan, who would otherwise also die young, and they’re going to live in peace, joy, and love, now and for eternity.
 And they might help save Neal Cassady.

 While going through my boxes of Eric’s treasures, I find myself hoping that somehow God, in eternity, will bless Sylvia in spite of her meanness.

It is an awesome thing to watch gods duel.
 Ashhur fled before either could strike a killing blow.
 I summoned our armies, as did the priests of Ashhur.
 Think now of the many deformed creatures that walk this world.
 Know they were all mere animals before the gods turned them into soldiers for their war.
 The elves were vicious in this time, slaying any who dared come near their forests.
 But some elves did side with Karak, determined to help end the war so the world could heal.”
 “Did Celestia not interfere?” Qurrah asked.
 In the darkness, Qurrah watched as Velixar’s face curled into a deep snarl.
 “Celestia befriended both brothers, but she took Ashhur to be her lover.

 How about tennis--do you like tennis?"

He did, however, concern himself with where I’d found a human.
 I refused to tell.
 It was the only gift I could give Noble, his safety.
 I laughed as I remembered that was how I’d convinced him to stay, promising him protection.
 A false promise.
 Eventually, one of the servants slipped, revealing they had seen me following my sister.
 And just like that, she was to blame for the entire ordeal, even though she’d never known.
 She’d been still searching the empty camp.
 At least I was off the hook.
 I surprised myself by being so slow.

Heat flooded my neck, and I felt it might engulf me as he spoke my name.
 “Frey.” “Yes.” It was all I could manage.
 His eyes held mine and I could swear he was searching for something.
 He opened his mouth to speak, but the door of the wardrobe flew open.
 “Oh.” Ruby giggled the tiniest bit.
 “Excuse me.
 I didn’t mean to interrupt.” She seemed pleased she had.
 Chevelle’s hand dropped and I could see out of the corner of my eye his face was hard.
 Ruby continued, “Steed said you had a guest so I just used the back…” She trailed off when his stare didn’t soften, but she smiled.
 “You know, you do have your own room.” He stiffened and stood, not at all amused by her implication.

Mrs. Tiggs, my Spanish teacher, had seemed every bit as mean as my Biology teacher from earlier in the day, and it had been a relief when Britney had finally dropped me off at home.
 I watched Britney's little white Saturn disappear down the lane with a complex set of feelings that included a bit of loneliness and more than a little relief.
 After a minute or two spent staring off into space, I finally decided the discomfort in my stomach was sharp enough to justify the effort of eating.
 Given the ridiculous heat, studying was the last thing I wanted to do, but there wasn't really anything else to do so I changed into cooler clothes and made the best of it.
 Three hours later my brain felt like it was going to run out of my nose, so I wandered upstairs.
 It was still too hot for comfort in my room, but unpacking in the heat was better than facing the math problems waiting for me downstairs.
 We'd partially unpacked things to get my bedspread out, so everything else went pretty quickly.
 My room wasn't particularly large, but someone had put a long shelf around the top of the room, and the closet had more storage space than my room back home.
 My meager belongings quickly found new homes.
 I looked one last time at the box holding my clothes, and then sighed and shoved it under the bed.

"It's so horrible.
 If-if I were to keep this beautiful ring, the first thing I'd want to do would be to run to my mother and tell her all about it.
 But I can't go to her.
 And when I can finally run to her, I won't be wearing this ring."
 Slowly she removed the ring from her finger.
 "I love you, Rick.
 I feel torn apart.
 But I have to go home!"
 Rick drew her into his arms, feeling torn apart himself.
 He couldn't bear the thought of losing her.

The group was waiting for us when we crossed over the ridge, down to the site where we had spent so many days and nights.
 If I hadn’t been so exhausted from lack of sleep, I would have probably been nervous.
 As it was, I blindly followed Ruby as we gathered and eventually mounted to leave.
 Chevelle, Steed, and I were back on our mounts from the earlier leg of the journey.
 Ruby, Grey, and Anvil each rode their own black horses, though Anvil’s was larger—I assumed to accommodate his massive frame—and Ruby’s was decorated, tendrils of red and gold in his mane.
 Though it wasn’t unusual, I didn’t see Rhys and Rider or the wolves.
 I wondered if they had their own horses and preferred to stay out of sight or if they ran with the wolves.
 I felt slightly comforted either way.
 Once we were on our way, I didn’t mind so much.
 I was enjoying being back in the rhythm of the ride, not to mention the break from training.

"But Mrs. Tiggs, isn't that covered in Chapter 18?
 I mean, I just started the class obviously, but it just seems confusing.
 Your syllabus says we're talking about the preterit today."
 The only other person I'd ever met who could've even come close to pulling off such an innocent expression was Rachel, and I wasn't sure even she could compete with Dominic today.
 If I'd found her standing in front of a broken window with a rock in her hand, and she'd told me she had no idea why the window had shattered, all the while flashing me that look, I would've believed her.
 Mrs. Tiggs apparently wasn't quite so gullible.
 "It's a reasonable question, as the two subjects are highly related.
 One could almost say they're so close to the same thing that any distinction is purely arbitrary."
 Now Dominic looked both innocent and confused.
 "But why are they so far apart in the book then?

An equally tough surfer, Butch Van Artsdalen, rode shotgun.
 I strode to their car, jammed my head through rolled-down shotgun side window and stared at Kris.
 “You babysitting these guys?” “It didn’t work out,” she said.
 Butch grabbed the door handle, but Jimmy told him to be cool, and he motioned me around to his side of the car.
 After I staggered there, I lashed him with a string of curses for two-timing my cousin and stealing my girl.
 And I gave notice that if Kris didn’t get out and come with me, I was going to pluck them both out of the car and so on.
 Jimmy sat rubbing his temples.
 Then he rolled up the window, started the car, and droved away.
 I slept on Jill’s couch.
 In the morning I walked to a donut shop.

"How was training?"
 It was hard to sound casual.
 The urge to kiss him had become almost overpowering in the last few days.
 He knew me better on every level imaginable than anyone outside my immediate family ever had, and all I could think about right now was how much I wanted to touch him.
 "Fairly well, all things considered.
 We took it easy though..." I'd gotten used to the idea that he left a substantial number of thoughts unsaid out of a desire to protect me from knowing too much.
 I didn't like it, but I'd learned to accept it.
 He didn't need to finish that particular sentence though.
 They'd gone easy because today was Ashure Day, and once the dance finished up, he'd be facing off against Brandon, and it would be stupid to tire himself out when he was going to be fighting for his life.
 It was a thought pretty much guaranteed to stifle a conversation, but I managed a smile.

I could see some party guests in the hallway behind him.
 The sound of the door and his voice had them looking at me from around his large frame.
 Their conversations stopped as their attention was drawn to the commotion.
 I stood and Dino directed me to approach him.
 He was obviously drunk and I could see the usual crazed look in his eyes.
 He started rambling something about how I didn’t like him or respect him and I quickly claimed I did.
 I was a lanky fifteen year old, probably about 5’8’, 140 pounds.
 He stepped towards me as I obeyed his wish for me to come to him.
 He hit me so fast I didn’t see it coming, and I flew backwards onto the desktop.
 All four legs of the desk broke beneath the impact of my body.

I closed my fist around it, mostly because I had seen him do the same, and instantly I knew what I wanted to see.
 I opened my palm up, grinning triumphantly, and exposed my creation for Chevelle to see.
 Balancing there was a slightly misshapen but undeniable sculpture of a small black horse.
 Chevelle rolled his eyes.
 Still smiling, I looked back to the stone, but it had returned to its uninteresting round shape.
 Chevelle answered my unspoken question.
 “Yes, it’s… tricky.” He smiled a little at using Steed’s word.
 “You can’t change something’s makeup, but you can change the way it appears.
 You can move it, but only if you’re near.
 You can stop someone’s heart, but you can’t make them feel happy about it.” He hesitated after that last part, contemplating, and then continued, “You can manipulate the elements, move water, draw it from the ground, but you cannot easily make it appear from nothing… though one can usually collect moisture from the air.

Cloaks flowing in the wind, forming a circle and then massing together, threatening.
 Black hair glistening with sweat in the moonlight and rolling in rhythm as the horse ran, its mane rocking hypnotically with the motion.
 Its heavy equine smell, so unlike any other.
 I clung to Chevelle’s strong back as we rode at full speed.
 The wind and rain cut at my face, my eyes sore, cheeks streaked with tears and ash.
 I woke startled to the sound of laughter.
 It took several minutes to gather my thoughts enough to know where I was.
 In bed… at Ruby’s.
 Ruby, the half-breed.
 I was drenched in sweat.

was it freshman year, sophomore?
 Mrs. McGonnigle.
 I think that’s right.
 Funny thing is, you know, she was kind of a fox.
 Too foxy to try and control a roomful of libidos.
 She dressed like a stewardess, I remember.
 Anyway, she took one look at this patch on my ass and drew in her breath as if I had a picture of a couple fucking on my jeans—she literally turned white.
 And sent me to the office, with a note recommending my suspension.
 I laugh now, but, hell, I was a little frightened.
 I mean, I hated school, right?

"She does her laundry here sometimes," Rick said.
 "There's not a hook-up in her apartment."
 "Oh.
 I know a lot of grad students, so I know what that's like."
 They'd told Teri and Jeremy that Marie was working on a master's degree in history at Boston College.
 As they headed for the living room, Rick slid his arm around Marie's waist, leaning close to whisper, "You're doing fine, sweetheart."
 She glanced up at him.
 "It's so hard to pretend we don't live together."
 He kissed her hair.
 "That's because it's become so natural to you."

I didn’t know what I would do, but by the time I reached Chevelle, I knew what I wanted: to retrieve my mother’s things from the vault.
 I would leave this wretched place behind.
 I made my stance more formal to match his as I said, “I want to learn transfer magic.” His mouth tightened and he turned his head, a half shake.
 “You taught me fire,” I argued.
 “For protection, Freya.” “Please,” I begged.
 He hesitated.
 I didn’t know how to convince him.
 Was it too soon for me to learn?
 I knew there was an order to the spells, knew you must earn the knowledge.
 If you went too fast or out of sequence you could endanger yourself.

Luckily the bell broke my strange fit of paralysis, and I was able to regain some of my composure while Mrs. Alexander struggled her way through the role.
 "I've been thinking about the fact that I didn't really give you young people a chance to ask any questions that might have come up during the course of your work on our section regarding light.
 Now's your chance, please ask away.
 If I don't know the answer, I'm sure that together we can find an adequate explanation for whatever you might have come across."
 The class was quiet for several seconds, before a hand finally shot up.
 I could have predicted who it would be.
 Every class has at least one teacher's pet.
 Some of the kids end up that way because they have this bizarre thirst for knowledge, some go that route because they like to make everyone else look stupid.
 Sammy was in the latter group.
 She'd probably been saving a question about light since we'd started the unit.

I got up and went to school early the next day, and then my daily routine would repeat itself.
 Somehow I willed myself to stick it out at school despite my surroundings and the influences of my peers.
 I don’t know what it was that enabled me to do this, to not fall entirely into the wasteland of addiction and entitlement.
 Biology?
 Character?
 It’s inexplicable, really.
 All of my roommates had dropped out of high school but somehow I continued; although my grades sucked, they were passing grades.
 In my senior year I only took classes until noon because that is all I needed to graduate.
 I got another job at a local restaurant for the lunch shift as well as any days I was off from the grocery store.
 I realized at an early age that nobody was going to give me anything and if I wanted something I would need to earn it.

Do you know of anything like that?"
 I heard something snap off to my right, but I was too busy blushing from the chorus of giggles coming from the front of the classroom.
 Even Mrs. Alexander had an amused smile on her kind face.
 "While there are certain types of vegetation that do indeed glow, I'm afraid I don't know of any natural phenomenon that would create the kind of effect you're referring to.
 Such a thing is still the provenance of science fiction writers."
 I knew I'd gotten a little carried away.
 The prime rule of high school survival involved avoiding situations people could use to ridicule you later, but I'd really wanted a rational explanation for my dreams.
 They seemed so real.
 I needed a friendly face to get me through the rest of class.
 Remembering Alec's smile from earlier, I looked over at him, hoping he'd return my sheepish grin.

She filled the front of the bathing suit, and the curve of her hips was all too apparent.
 To her eyes, she looked bulky.
 She didn't want to go out there and ask Rick's opinion.
 She blushed again at the thought of people seeing her like this.
 But people would see her at the shore tomorrow, so she pushed the curtain aside and stepped out.
 "Rick?"
 He looked around.
 And his mouth fell open.
 She had a fantastic body.
 He never would have guessed it.

The rest of the kids at the table were listening just as intensely, all except for the brunette on Brandon's left who was looking in our direction.
 My face pulled back in a smile, I even brought my hand partway up in a wave before I realized I recognized her.
 It was the trendy girl from the office, and she apparently still didn't like me.
 I felt my face get even hotter, only now I was both angry and embarrassed.
 It was a relief to sink down into a chair with my back to Brandon and his friends.
 Strangely enough, Britney also being so obviously uncomfortable helped calm me down.
 "Okay, out with it, why is this such a big deal?"
 Britney shifted back and forth in her seat for a couple of seconds before leaning in to whisper.
 "It really shouldn't be a big deal, but everyone around here acts like it's taboo.
 Two hikers were killed by some kind of wild animal a few months ago."

It did not take long before a group of soldiers spotted them.
 “Show them no mercy, Aurelia,” Felewen said, her warm voice turning cold.
 “They will die with little suffering,” the sorceress responded.
 “It’s the most I can give.”
 Electricity arced between her hands.
 Blue fire surrounded her eyes.
 The five human soldiers raised their shields and charged as a single unit.
 Felewen stood next to Aurelia, her sword high and her armor gleaming.
 She kept the blade out and pointed at the center soldier.
 When the bolt of lightning came shrieking out from Aurelia’s hands, that same soldier found himself lifted from the ground, his hands flailing, his useless sword and shield falling.

Slow recovery from the recent global recession has restrained the growth of foreign trade.
 Down-sizing by major corporations in response to intense competitive pressures has eliminated many jobs which are not being restored, even after the recession is over.
 Privatization and restructuring of public sector companies in response to fiscal pressures has had a similar effect.
 In the United Kingdom alone, an estimated 500,000 jobs will be lost for this reason in 1994.
 The impact of structural adjustments programmes has slowed economic growth and new job creation in a number of developing countries.
 Gains in productivity due to new technology, particularly delayed gains from the micro-computer revolution of the 1980s and the growth of factory automation, have slowed job growth in some industries.
 The increasing competitiveness of the NIEs of Asia and most recently China has displaced jobs in the West, primarily unskilled jobs.
 The major impact of several of these factors has already been felt and is now beginning to subside.
 Some will continue for several more years.
 Still others may entirely reverse their direction and contribute to job growth later in the decade.

I stood and marched away, fuming at the idea that both of them were in on it.
 They might have been council, but it didn’t stop the feeling of betrayal.
 They’d lied to me, acted as if they’d cared.
 I was done with them.
 With everyone.
 I wanted as far away from all of it as possible.
 But I didn’t make it far.
 Exhaustion caught up with me a few miles later and I found an old oak tree, sliding down its massive trunk to rest my aching legs.
 I’d never run so far in my life and my head throbbed.
 I was seething with anger and frustration and the feeling of being ensnared.

The media can play an invaluable role in disseminating relevant information to the public, but the type and quality of information being carried in most developing countries must be radically improved.
 The worldwide tendency to focus on the immediate and dramatic at the expense of that which could make a substantial and lasting contribution to development requires greater efforts to creatively present socially useful information in an easily accessible and interesting form.
 Information in developing countries
 In the industrial democracies there are usually multiple sources of independent information available to the public on most issues.
 The same is not the case in developing countries, where very often the sole source of information is government – which lacks credibility because the quality of information is poor or it is politically motivated – or academic institutions that are insulated from practical, especially commercial, realities.
 The need is especially great for broadcasting value-added information at the local level.
 Specialized agencies should be established in developing countries in the form of public foundations or independent research institutions to provide a credible, unbiased source of information by identifying critical gaps in public awareness needed to stimulate development in various fields; conducting studies to document proven practices in agriculture, business, education, health, government, media; disseminating information on new opportunities; commissioning films, novels, short stories and syndicated columns to communicate developmental information; supporting pioneering examples of new or improved activities in different fields; encouraging others to imitate successful pioneers; recognizing and rewarding high achievers.
 A modest investment in new institutions to disseminate information can have an impact comparable to that of the information superhighways being heralded in the most industrially advanced nations – accelerating adoption of new activities, magnifying response to government programmes, and doubling the total developmental achievements of a country over the next five years.
 Information as a stimulus to transition
 The people of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are highly educated, but long deprived of free access to information.

The fish was in the net.
 The girl, Ashley, had taken the bait, and I felt confident that I had the deal working.
 Now I would need to go home and hope my wife’s level of understanding would allow me to be completely honest with her about what I was doing, and what I had just done.
 I knew Lisa wanted to help Brandon and we both knew my involvement would require a venture into unchartered territory but I needed her to know everything.
 Lisa and I had been married for twenty-four years and we knew what lay ahead would be a bigger test of our commitment than what I had just done.
 We needed to help Brandon and I needed to believe this would also help the kids I was attempting to bust, just as my son getting busted was one step closer to hitting bottom, and hopefully one step closer to getting off of these powerful drugs.
 There was no turning back now.
 Before I got home from my massage, my crack-berry phone rang and it was Ashley.
 She called me to ask if I could bring her a few Oxys to hold her over for the night.
 I, of course, didn’t have any Oxys so I told her I couldn’t get out and we could do the whole deal at once.

We had plans for the next day.
 Billy and I, Eric, and Kenny were going to drive up the coast to Laguna Beach, for the annual sidewalk art festival.
 Billy, like his brother Cliff, had a gift for drawing.
 On Sunday morning about nine, I phoned Kenny to tell him Billy was at my house and ask when he meant to pick us up.
 Things weren’t decided yet, he said, because Eddie Carmichael and Mike Beatty wanted to go along, except not to Laguna Beach.
 They wanted to drive to the desert, to the Indio Date Festival, which they claimed was a good party.
 Billy and I didn’t favor the idea of six guys, including big Mike Beatty, riding 150 miles over the mountains and back in Kenny’s mom’s Volkswagen.
 Still, I asked Kenny to call us when the plans were settled.
 He promised to.
 But he didn’t.

Didja make a pass at one of their sisters?
 Like…
 Eugene – No, I didn’t do anything.
 Jim – Didja use the wrong gang hand-signs again?
 Like that time when you told those kids that you were a member of the northern-southeastern-side bloody gangsta hood lords…
 Eugene – I didn’t use and hand signs.
 Jim – That was funny, it took em 5 minutes to put all those signs together and realize what you said.
 When they finally did, I thought they we’re gonna die laughing.
 And then you turned that dark red color and ran off.
 And then they laughed even harder.

I raced through the crowds, jumping and ducking.
 I looked over my shoulder and up the hill, wishing I could escape all the bodies that were pressed together in combat.
 Then I rammed into one.
 “What the heck?” I fell on my butt and blinked as Jason picked himself off the ground.
 “Sorry,” I said and stood up.
 “Watch where you’re going… Jazell, look out!” Jason suddenly yelled.
 I dove onto the ground and felt the monster brush past me.
 I looked up to see Jason rolling on the ground before jumping on the faery jerk’s back.
 He yelled at Jason right before I saw the knife disappear somewhere in his neck.
 The faery’s yells turned to screams and then nothing.

BG:  	Yeah it is.
 And that’s sitar on it—though we miked it so it sounds sort of like a harp.
 CM: 	Ok.  “Building Cla-Le-Clare?”
 BG:  	You know, Larry co-wrote that.
 CM:  	Larry?
 BG:  	Raspberry.
 As in the Highsteppers.
 We wrote that when I was back in Memphis because my mother was in the hospital.
 Larry came and sat with me in her room—he’s a bloke, man, a true spirit.
 He would come and sit with me, and, while we were watching over her—it was horrible, stomach cancer, and her heart was weak, I thought, shit, we’re losing her—anyway, Larry was there.

Eugene – Johnny, that means I have two brothers now.
 Jim – I thought your math was better than that Gene.
 Liz – Really Gene, someone who is capable of at least high-school algebra should have caught onto that right away.
 Eugene – I forgot about Johnny, with all the excitement of the day.
 Liz – I wonder how much this is all going to cost.
 Eugene – Do you think it will be expensive?
 Liz – Court fees usually are.
 Maybe this won’t take too much, unless your dad doesn’t let go.
 Eugene – He will.
 Why shouldn’t he.

I managed to snap my slack jaw shut at the same moment I realized I had angled my body toward him when he’d addressed me.
 I mentally cursed, but I could recover this; I would just keep going in the same direction as if I were on my way to town, because I was on my way to town.
 There was no need for him to know it was to research someone associated with the Council.
 Someone like him.
 I tried to respond to his greeting, but felt choked and instead only nodded back, my mouth tight as I endeavored to grin with a now clenched jaw.
 I groaned internally, keeping on the path, not daring to look back in case he was behind me.
 I was convinced he was.
 He wouldn’t be taking the back way to Junnie’s as I had come, and he wouldn’t be leaving the village without a pack; he was likely going to a Council meeting.
 Yes, he was certainly right behind me, following me into town.
 Somehow I made it to the library without tripping or looking back, though I was nearly overcome with the temptation to turn at the door to see him one more time.

She was approaching the house and I was alone.
 Part of me wondered if I was fast enough to get to my room before she came in.
 I hadn’t made up my mind before the door opened beside me.
 She purred.
 “Well, well.
 Alone, are we?” She smiled wickedly as she neared, coming uncomfortably close.
 “Let’s talk…” She leaned in further and something glistened in the air between us.
 I froze, unable to move away.
 “Stop.” Chevelle’s voice was sharp as the redhead was whisked away from me, laughing.
 Her curls brushed my face on their way past, taking my head on a dizzying spin.

“I take it you know him?” he asked.
 “He’s following me,” I announced, too loud.
 His eyes were concerned, so I let down my guard, moving to stand behind him.
 Chevelle approached us, staring directly at me as if there were not the broad, tall form of the stranger between us.
 He let me see his irritation for one long moment before his features melted back into their standard sternness.
 For some reason, it infuriated me, and I nearly berated him right there.
 But I remembered I was on the run.
 I remembered this strange elf in front of me.
 I decided to keep my mouth shut before I dug a deeper hole.
 An arm wrapped around my shoulder and drew me forward.

The tremendous potential for accelerating development is most easily illustrated by in stances in which actual achievements substantially excelled expectations, such as the enormous leap in world agriculture during the 1960s and 1970s and the phenomenal growth of incomes, employment and exports in East Asia during the last ten years.
 These unforeseen accomplishments reflect the magnitude of potentials that these countries possessed but had not previously utilized.
 The untapped resources of the society can be categorized under several headings:
 Knowledge of the process of development and the factors that stimulate it.
 Education that imparts progressive social values and practically useful perspectives.
 Information that creates awareness of opportunities.
 Values that foster productivity, organization and social cohesion.
 Skills that improve quality and productivity.
 Successful systems that improve efficiency and expand activities.
 Organizations that promote cooperation, coordination and broaden the sphere of activity.

I don’t know what will happen.
 I heard a noise in the front room and slid the book under a pillow, dropped my head, and pretended to sleep.
 I’d been so absorbed in the book I had no idea how long I’d been reading.
 There was a light rap on my door.
 I tried to sound sleepy.
 “Yes?” “Frey, I’m on my way to the ridge.
 We will be leaving in the morning.” Ruby’s words confused me.
 I must have read through the night.
 “Okay.” “Steed is here.
 You can stay with him or go with me.” “I’ll stay.” I listened to her footsteps recede.

Elves battled in the street, horribly outnumbered.
 They were skilled, though, and a steady stream of arrows from homes continued to weaken the human forces.
 “Halt here,” Qurrah said.
 To their right was a two-story elven home.
 Three bowmen fired from the windows at a party of fifteen soldiers.
 The men of Neldar had their shields raised high, but the synergy between the elves in the home and the elves on the street was superb.
 The Tun brothers watched the sword wielders on the ground dance in, make a few precise swings to change the positioning of the shields, and then dart away.
 Arrows quickly followed these maneuvers, biting into exposed flesh.
 Qurrah motioned to the building housing the archers.
 “Go inside.

 I can see me just staying home, writing, being with Lor, house-husband, you know, and just writing, and saying let someone else record the stuff.
 But, I’ll always write.
 CM:  	Anything besides songs?
 BG:  	I, uh, I really don’t want to talk about it too much.

The moment it slipped from his lips, he became more focused on that than anything else.
 Making me his bride.
 I couldn’t understand.
 He tried to explain.
 “I want you forever.
 I need you, Lizzy.” The yearning in his voice was clear on the last part and I was surprised that I ached for him a little, felt for his pain and need.
 He touched me then and I thought I understood when he continued, “We could be together…” Marriage.
 Yes, he wanted to join us.
 I bit my lip, undecided.
 Curiosity was there, too.

Dire Cats are smarter than regular lions; they might see you as an ally or part of their herd.
 No wait, I think with cats you call them prides.
 But I wonder how they see Doi’van and me?” she asked.
 Neither Doi’van nor Rodregas had an answer to that question.
 “Well,” Rodregas said, “we need to find shelter and if they meant us harm us they would not have shown themselves.
 It’s getting dark.
 Let’s get the horses into the barn.
 If they have been tracking me since I let them out, they don’t seem to want to do any great harm.” With that Rodregas got out of the wagon and started to pull the horses into the barn.
 Their noses were flaring, and he had to pull them almost to the opening.
 As soon as they got close they both went charging in; they sensed the barn was shelter to keep them safe from the Dire Cats.

A couple of guys who looked like they were old enough to be in college were rolling their eyes at him.
 They were whispering and laughing, but positioned as they were closer to Alec than to me, I couldn't make out any of what they were saying.
 While I agreed completely with their sentiment, they were so loud they were disturbing at least twenty or thirty people.
 Hopefully they'd quiet down once the actual show started up.
 Judging by the orchestra, it was almost time.
 I looked back, intending to shoot the obnoxious pair a nasty glare in the hopes it would shut them up, and instead caught Alec's eye.
 The house lights were still bright enough for me to make out every detail of his perfect face, and yet I was still baffled by his expression.
 He'd obviously been staring at me, was still staring at me actually, but it wasn't a leer.
 It was something else, it made me want to blush, or maybe smile and toss my hair.
 Whatever it was, it left my skin feeling warmer than usual, and more than a little tight.

I pressed, taking the chance.
 “Why?” I heard movement behind me and the fear returned tenfold.
 Chevelle didn’t tense; he only let out an exasperated breath.
 “It’s fine,” he said.
 He released me and I turned to see who he’d addressed.
 Four figures stood in a line, almost a formation, and they relaxed at his words.
 My arm tingled as the blood returned to the limb, freed of his harsh grip.
 Yes, he hates me.
 I flexed my fist.
 “Ah, she escaped,” Ruby purred.

"I don't believe you.
 At least not the part about it not being anything to worry about.
 You all wouldn't have been so worried about Alec bringing me home Friday night if this was all no big deal.
 None of you have argued with Alec about anything since then, but Friday night James, Jasmin and Jessica were all ready to rip my head off over his express orders."
 The nod I received this time was even slower than the first.
 I waited for Isaac to say something, but he seemed unwilling to give away anything I hadn't already figured out for myself.
 "Can he win?
 Alec, I mean.
 Can he ki...beat Brandon?"
 Isaac's sigh was eloquent.

“I’ve lost my mentor.
 Can you teach me magic?
 Help me, so I don’t do something out of order, hurt myself?” His eyebrows drew down, coming together as he began his reply, but a fallen branch cracked at the edge of the clearing and his head snapped toward it.
 I sucked in a harsh breath as Chevelle strode toward us.
 The elf who had been sitting with me was now in a fiercely protective stance in front of me.
 I leaned around him to see, placing my hand on his leg as I angled my head past it.
 That broke his stare and he glanced down at me.
 I watched Chevelle, still walking casually toward us, as if there weren’t two angry panthers preparing to pounce on him.
 But I must have appeared about as threatening as a kitten, because the leg I was gripping shook with laughter.
 My angry gaze turned on my new acquaintance and he raised his hands in surrender, still chuckling.

"I should be very hurt by your lack of faith, but seeing as how you've been through so much lately, I'll forgive you."
 My heart was suddenly trying to hammer its way out of my throat, which had constricted so tightly I couldn't seem to get any air down to my starving lungs.
 "How did you...nobody knows..." Brandon's hand was on my shoulder despite my inability to remember how it had gotten there.
 "Are you okay?
 I was just kidding, you know, about the near fight and then telling Alec off and having Britney decide she was moving on to greener pastures.
 I didn't mean anything by it."
 The attack was still trying to overwhelm me, but Brandon not knowing the full extent of my weakness robbed it of some of the momentum necessary to roll me all the way under.
 I managed some kind of reply, one that might've even been witty, but which apparently didn't manage to cover up the fact I wasn't really okay.
 We drove in silence the rest of the way into town, and by the time we turned into the school parking lot I'd come back to myself enough to be desperately looking for something else to say.
 I needed something cool enough Brandon wouldn't write me off as a lost cause.

“I do, and it does not surprise me as much as it should.
 I’m not sure who would mate with our mother, but some elf man did.
 We are smarter than most realize, you know that.
 Our features are sharper, and we only resemble the orcs that attacked Veldaren.
 It is a part of us.
 Unwanted, perhaps, but I shall not cower and hide a part of who I am.”
 “Just strange, is all,” Harruq said.
 “Life is strange.”
 They both lay down to rest, a new life awaiting them in Woodhaven.

Chapter 28 Alec was completely drenched in sweat, and I still wanted to throw myself at him so badly my teeth hurt.
 It shouldn't be possible for someone to look so good dressed in what amounted to little more than loose, extra-stretchy sweatpants.
 "How was training?"
 It was hard to sound casual.
 The urge to kiss him had become almost overpowering in the last few days.
 He knew me better on every level imaginable than anyone outside my immediate family ever had, and all I could think about right now was how much I wanted to touch him.
 "Fairly well, all things considered.
 We took it easy though..." I'd gotten used to the idea that he left a substantial number of thoughts unsaid out of a desire to protect me from knowing too much.
 I didn't like it, but I'd learned to accept it.
 He didn't need to finish that particular sentence though.

And he knew that she was a virgin.
 He'd felt her initial hesitation when he'd tried to coax her lips apart, felt the shock go through her body when his tongue had touched hers.
 The fact that she'd found the kiss exciting didn't change the fact that she was an innocent.
 Or that she was far from home.
 Or that she was engaged to another man.
 He had no qualms about wooing her away from her fiancé, but how could she be anything but confused when she couldn't even talk to the man?
 Heavy-hearted, he finally got to his feet.
 He could no longer hear her sobs, but he knew he needed to give her some time alone.
 He wanted to give her a gift of apology, some flowers or something.
 But there were lots of flowers in the garden.

Johnny – What’s the difference?
 Jim - I like a lot of stupid things.
 I usually know that they’re stupid, but I still like them.
 Like those old monster movies from the 1950s, they’re terrible, but I still enjoy watching them.
 Johnny – You’re weird.
 Jim – Haven’t we gone over this before?
 Johnny – Yeah, a bunch of times.
 Jim – Then why do you keep bringing it up?
 Johnny – Because you’re still weird.
 And you seem to forget how weird you are.

Almost before I'd realized it, my hand shot up.
 "Is the light always blue?
 Is it ever a whitish-gold color?"
 Mrs. Alexander looked slightly startled, like she'd never thought of such an idea, or maybe just that she hadn't been expecting a question from anyone other than Sammy.
 "Not that I'm aware of.
 The water will actually emit quite a bit of ultraviolet light, but for whatever reasons, the electrons don't ever seem to release any electromagnetic radiation down in the lower energy levels like infrared, or even the visible red.
 You'd need red and all of the other colors to generate a true white light."
 It was obvious we were on the wrong track here.
 "What about some other mechanism?
 One that wouldn't just make water glow with a dancing gold light, but plants too.

“The calling is simply service to Grand Council.
 A hundred years of servitude under the guise of duty and honor.
 What is honorable about doing their bidding?” “So you don’t… answer the call?” I stumbled, searching for words.
 His laughter was a roar.
 “No.
 We do not answer.” It settled and he added, “They do not call.” At that, Steed joined in, chuckling.
 It didn’t make sense.
 I knew I had been assigned a watcher.
 From the North.
 “No one?” I asked.

“Why?” she asked, her voice curious on his repeated questioning.
 “Because I am wondering if our ‘Paladin’ has a connection to the Dire Cats.
 I know a Celestial lion was used in the ceremony and whoever our Paladin is I assume he now has it’s essence, and those two were taken as the Celestial’s mates.”  Imeralda and Doi’van looked at him, and then she slowly added, “And what was one of your first actions?
 You freed them from the dungeon.
 Dire Cats are smarter than regular lions; they might see you as an ally or part of their herd.
 No wait, I think with cats you call them prides.
 But I wonder how they see Doi’van and me?” she asked.
 Neither Doi’van nor Rodregas had an answer to that question.
 “Well,” Rodregas said, “we need to find shelter and if they meant us harm us they would not have shown themselves.
 It’s getting dark.

If you would like to share this book with another person, please purchase an additional copy for each recipient.
 Thank you for respecting the hard work of this author.
 Dedication I dedicate this book to my wife Lisa, the one person who has been with me through more ups and downs than anyone could ever imagine.
 You never know when or if the perfect person will appear.
 The fateful night I set eyes on her set in motion everything that would happen to me for the rest of my life.
 I couldn’t be happier that I was fortunate enough to be in the right place at the perfect time to meet my soul mate.
 She is the most beautiful person, both inside and out.
 She has been an inspiration for me and making her happy is the goal of my life.
 We are best friends, confidants, partners, and true lovers and together we are one.
 I can’t imagine my existence without her, and I know that everything I am and all I will become is shaped by her genuine kindness.

The tip of a sword pressed against the side of his neck, drawing blood from the slightest pressure.
 “He looks mad,” said the guard.
 “Died fighting us, don’t that sound right?”
 Every muscle in Harruq’s body tensed, knowing his moment to act would need to be perfect.
 Before he could, a feminine voice shouted down the alley, startling all three.
 “Both of you, stop that this instant!”
 Through blurred vision, Harruq saw a woman with auburn hair standing at the edge of the alley.
 The patrolmen also turned to look, their weapons still in hand.
 “Who the abyss…‌oh, go on back to your forest, Aurelia.
 Nothing to see here.”

One of the cats (Rodregas had not been able to tell the two apart yet) stretched over and started to rub her chin against Rodregas’ leg.
 The power behind its head was such that it almost knocked him over.
 He had seen small house cats make similar gestures, but it was disconcerting to have two powerful predators such as the Dire Cats being so friendly.
 “I guess this means we are part of the pride,” said Imeralda, slowly reaching over and giving the other cat a tummy rub.
 Rodregas held his breath, as the cat responded with its paws by stretching out, its claws popping free with the stretch.
 They showed no signs of aggression, but just looking at the size of their claws, and then at Imeralda, made Rodregas want to jump over the Dire Cat and put his body in front of her.
 Rodregas was fully aware of how one swipe of those claws would likely kill her.
 Unlike the house cats that he was familiar with, Rodregas could see a kind of intelligence in their eyes.
 He had the feeling they both knew to be careful with a fragile mortal, and they thought it was funny that he was so worried.
 This scene repeated itself almost every night, and several times the cats also brought game they had killed into the farmyard.

 You can take the South—wait, shit, how does that go?

When he does say something it’s usually so pointless and offensive that any chicks who might have managed to overlook his bizarre hair and lack of physical mass would be so insulted that they would probably try to kill the annoying little bastard.
 Jim – Don’t even compare Batman to Sumo Assassin!
 Batman is a weakling in a stupid costume with some gizmos, without his gizmos he’s just a loser in tights.
 All Sumo Assassin has to protect him from his enemies are, his Sumo Loin Cloth, and his Sumo Fighting Skills.
 They’re all he needs.
 Hell the loincloth isn’t even bullet proof.
 On top of that the Sumo-mobile can outrun the Bat-mobile any day of the week, not to mention the fact that its solar powered so its earth friendly.

I looked around for some kind of support from the other girls present, but couldn't find even one sympathetic face.
 The next thing I knew I was on the ground with my ears ringing and Cassie standing over me.
 "...your stupid lies.
 If you repeat them you'll be sorry.
 Every single person here will vouch for Brandon."
 A couple of people flinched a little at that, like they weren't completely comfortable lying, but Cassie stared them down.
 Nobody would meet my gaze.
 I opened my mouth to protest, and Cassie grabbed me by the front of my jacket and dragged me the better part of twenty feet.
 My head was still spinning as she leaned down and hissed into my ear.
 "Get out of here.

“Yes.
 Go rest in your shame.
 I have no use for you.”
 The spirit gave Qurrah one last glare then dissipated into the fading light.
 Silence filled the room.
 “Well, what did you think?” asked Harruq.
 “I think,” Qurrah said, “that was enjoyable.”
 The two paused, each thinking the same thing.
 Finally, Harruq voiced his thoughts.
 “You think Velixar knew it when he sent us to kill him?”

He stood, whirling to face me, bloody blade held out.
 I had to stifle another laugh.
 I managed to keep my reaction calm, only a smile.
 He seemed disoriented for a moment and then his breathing slowed and his arms relaxed.
 He stared at me as if I were a delusion, a dream looking back at him.
 He was speechless and it occurred to me that perhaps elves were not a part of this human’s knowledge.
 I wondered if he would recover soon.
 I considered abandoning him and returning to watch the others, but his face was so interesting, the emotions so plain and readable there.
 But he wasn’t afraid.
 It was awe.

Issuing of the old dinar was stopped, but it remained in circulation as legal tender.
 An interest rate of six per cent was established for the superdinar - the first real, positive interest rate in years - to make holding the new currency an attractive alternative to hoarding goods or foreign exchange.
 It had been widely anticipated by foreign experts that this strategy would result in an immediate run on the country's foreign reserves and thereby a collapse of the new currency's foundation.
 Contrary to expectations, the initial months of the programme have yielded spectacular results.
 Inflation fell to zero per cent in the first week after the issue of the new currency and remained below one per cent during the first five months.
 Instead of a massive outflow of foreign currency through conversion of superdinars, people have rushed to cash in their foreign currency, resulting in a 60 per cent increase in the nation's reserves during the first three months.
 One of the most significant features of the programme has been its fair distribution of benefits and low social cost to the population.
 In contrast with the widespread outrage felt by Russian citizens over repeated episodes of demonetization and confiscation of household savings, the Yugoslav people have enthusiastically accepted the new currency as representative of a new deal for the poor and the working class.
 In addition, instead of the severe contraction of output experienced elsewhere, production rose by more than 100 per cent during the first five months, stimulating an increase in employment and demand for new investment.
 Real tax revenues have increased significantly.

I chose.
 “Of North Camber.” It must have been the right answer, because he grabbed me, exultant, sighing and kissing my skin.
 He held me with a fierceness, a gentleness, that took my breath.
 His lips trailed my cheeks, murmuring words and careful of wounds as they swept to a temple, my eyelid, the corner of my mouth.
 He lingered there, unable to resist touching the broken skin of my lips, even if it were only feather light, the barest brush of skin.
 He drew away slowly, feeling my shock, or seeing it in my eyes, and realizing his mistake.
 His expression fell, but he didn’t take his hands away.
 He swallowed hard, waiting for my confirmation.
 But I wasn’t the other Elfreda, not the long list of binding words that had been my identity for so long.
 I couldn’t seem to reconcile the two lives.

Free from practice, free from duties, free from walls.
 Though tricky to set up, the spell worked on Rune.
 I showed up at practice early and whispered the words in case something went wrong and he heard.
 I can’t imagine what my punishment would have been, though it might have been worth it.
 He fell asleep quickly and I ran as fast as I could, my pulse pounding with excitement.
 I spent the entire day away from the castle.
 Without the drain of practice, I was thrilling with energy.
 I could feel the trees, the mountain.
 I hope Father never comes back!
 I am sure I will try again tomorrow and every day I can spare after that.

The chain of agricultural training needs to be filled out at the lower level by establishing thousands of village-level farm schools as proposed in the chapter on food security.
 The switch from centrally planned to market-oriented economic systems in Eastern Europe cannot be successful until the population has acquired the skills needed to function effectively in the new economic environment.
 Under the communist system, emphasis was placed on education and training in technical subjects with little attention to marketing, organizational, commercial and interpersonal skills, which are essential requirements for functioning in a market economy.
 A detailed inventory should be compiled of the types and levels of skills needed for transition to the market, covering areas such as entrepreneurship, management, national and international marketing, strategic business planning, finance, quality control, product development, production technology, design, and human resource development.
 Intensive training programmes need to be introduced to impart these skills on a massive scale.
 Even in the most advanced industrial nations there is vast scope for upgrading skills to improve productivity and to keep pace with rapid technological development.
 Inadequate skills are a major impediment to the assimilation of new technologies.
 The increasing demands of global competitiveness place pressure on workers in these countries to continuously improve their skills.
 The mismatch between the skills of the workforce and the evolving needs of industry aggravates unemployment.
 Studies of the return on investment from training programmes document the enormous benefits of continuously upgrading the skills of the workforce.

This situation has changed, especially after humanity’s bitter experiments with totalitarian regimes during this century.
 It is now recognized that the democratic principles of political freedom, social equality, self-determination and related human rights are inalienable and must be extended to all people everywhere.
 The second factor that naturally imposes limits on national sovereignty – the rights of other nations and their citizens – has also gained substantially wider acceptance, has been enshrined by international law, and has become accepted doctrine governing many facets of international relations.
 Common security against transnational threats and common prosperity for all humankind cannot be based on a 250-year-old concept of nation sovereignty.
 Over the last half century, national sovereignty has been maturing into international sovereignty.
 As the evolution of the international community proceeds towards the establishment of an effective system of world governance in one form or another, the collective rights of the international community of nations must inevitably come to be regarded as another inalienable truth, alongside individual human rights and the rights of each nation.
 The right of the nation state to self-determination has to accommodate the rights of other nations and the common shared rights of every human being.
 This approach establishes criteria for determining when claims of national sovereignty must be ignored.
 Every right is accompanied by a responsibility.
 A government that fosters external aggression or cannot contain domestic violence and civil strife, that cannot create conditions in which its people can feed themselves or even receive outside assistance, fails the test of sovereignty.

The girls were taken.
 The parties were private, the bars off limits to minors.
 We spent our evenings with the fellow who had picked us and invited us to flop with him and his roommates.
 The three of them were carpenters, down from New York and New Jersey for the winter.
 Bobby Casso was one of them.
 He claimed his dad was a Mafioso until he got on some capo’s hit list and fled to parts unknown.
 Bobby was a master storyteller, and one of his stories pierced my soul.
 In summers, Bobby worked as a bartender at the Left Bank, a saloon in Lindenhurst, Long Island.
 One of the regulars was Jack Kerouac.
 My only living hero, according to Bobby, had become nothing more than a woeful drunk who sat brooding over his liquor until closing time.

Marie shook her head.
 "No, thank you."
 "She's too excited about seeing me again."
 Tom grinned at his favorite cousin.
 She smiled at him.
 "So you're saying you've made me lose my appetite?"
 "I wouldn't phrase it like that."
 She loved seeing Tom again.
 He'd obviously missed her as much as John had, and as he'd escorted her in to dinner, he'd whispered that he'd pick her up at 8:00 Saturday to take her to a speakeasy.
 "Maybe you could join us at the Cape one weekend, Tom," Mrs. Tranton suggested.

Depending on their sigils, they were likely to be either faster or stronger or both.
 But Rodregas’ short swords would not cut their armor.
 It put them at an extreme disadvantage.
 As the arrows flew over his head, he became aware of the other disadvantage of bows.
 They were dealing with a limited supply of arrows; once the arrows where all shot, they lost their main advantage.
 Rodregas heard the noise of the first soldier to rush from the road; he went low and swung hard.
 Rodregas hit knee high and the man trying to run by went flying head first into the dirt.
 Rodregas knew from the feel of the blow that his sword had hit armor and bounced off.
 It was an Immortal Guard.
 Doi’van shot another arrow almost straight down into the back of the neck of the downed guard.

A simple outline of a bird with outstretched wings marked the delicate skin at the base of my palm.
 Unbelievably tiny runes surrounded the bottom of its wings, making a pattern appear.
 I smiled as I praised her.
 “It’s beautiful.” One eyebrow shot up and she jumped from the bed, grabbing my wrist and pulling me with her.
 I hoped she hadn’t smudged the design.
 I checked it as soon as she stopped in front of her mirror and let my arm go.
 “And this.” It wasn’t a question.
 She was proud of her work.
 The eyes that stared back at me in the reflection grew large as they took in her mastery.
 Gone was the girl I’d been in the village.

Food prices are extremely sensitive to changes in the supply of foodstuffs.
 Even a small increase or decrease in supply can lead to a very wide fluctuation in prices.
 A bumper harvest can depress prices to the point of bankrupting large numbers of farmers.
 A poor harvest can send food prices soaring beyond the purchasing power of large numbers of people.
 Buffer stocks, subsidies and incentives are used to protect agriculture from sharp price fluctuations.
 Al though the principles of free trade argue that countries should produce only those items in which they possess a competitive advantage and procure the rest from overseas, few nations are willing to entrust their food supply entirely or even substantially to foreign parties.
 For decades Japan maintained trade barriers to keep the price of rice at more than six times the international level in order to protect and preserve domestic rice producers; the US government exports subsidized wheat; and the European Community sells subsidized milk powder and butter internationally at prices up to one-third below the domestic level.
 The debate over the legitimate role of government in protection of the agricultural economy is partially a question of timing.
 Market institutions and competitive strengths are normally built up over decades.
 Advanced nations with highly mechanized and efficient agricultural sectors are in a much better position to withstand the impact of foreign competition than countries at an earlier stage of development.

My dad bought it for me, I think at Guitar and Drum City, which used to be on Summer Avenue in Memphis.
 I was, I don’t know, seven, eight..
 I didn’t take any lessons or anything—I’m not sure my folks could have afforded them.
 But, when I picked up that little stringed toy, really, it was as if I knew it already, as if I’d been there before, in a dream, in a previous incarnation, Lor might say.
 Lorelei Enos:	 	Your soul, your old soul.
 BG:  	Right.
 It taught me to play, whatever came to me from the ozone of the past.
 I think the first thing I picked out on it was “Feelin’ Alright.”  Can that be right, timewise?
 I don’t know.
 Maybe it was “Baby Let’s Play House.”  I remember doing “Baby Let’s Play House” at school, on the blacktop playground of Idlewild Elementary, for Mike and Mark and little Patty Grabenhorst, on whom I had the worst kind of crush.

The floor was also stone, and there was not enough dirt and debris for them to grow very large.
 They had to clear a path to get the wagon in.
 Imeralda ran her hand over the stone with a surprisingly gentle caress.
 “It is Nymph stone, right?” Rodregas asked.
 She nodded and said, “Yes, I am half Forest Nymph and half AElf and this is beautiful work.” All Nymphs have a specific attachment to nature such as forest, stone or water.
 There was a lot of variation among the Nymphs, but they could do amazing things with their element.
 A connection to stone is much sought after by mages.
 The stone could not store magic like the circles but it could smooth out the high level of magic available on ley lines and make it more comfortable to use, not in the big way of the magic of circles, but for using magic in small ways.
 And, of course, only homes made by nymphs could make living on a ley line comfortable.
 “This home truly is a find,” said Doi’van, “and now I see why the Dire Cats showed themselves to us.” “What do you mean?” Rodregas asked.

Do not be so selfish as to want it all to yourself.” With that he gave a punch to Rodregas’ side, causing Rodregas to grunt in pain, and Doi’van followed the other two out the door.
 Rodregas laid in the bed, his mind whirling with thoughts.
 At first he thought about the implications of what Jordaan had shared.
 But, then his mind went back again and again over his and Imeralda’s time during the last few weeks and then back to Doi’van’s words.
 He knew his friend spoke the truth, but he was not so sure about his ability to do what he needed to keep his relationship with the beautiful AElven Nymph.
 CHAPTER 11 THE NATURE OF BONDS
 The next few days Rodregas and Doi’van recovered quickly under the powerful healing magic of Jordaan.
 This is not to say Rodregas did not spend most of his time dreaming that the handsome young Nymph would head back to his own estates.
 They were staying in a small village that seemed to be mostly a forest with small rooms built into it.
 Rodregas could not figure out any set pattern to the place or its boundaries.

I froze as he spoke low, his breath on my neck sending a shiver through me.
 “Stay.
 Still.” He was gone.
 He moved so fast it took a moment to understand.
 The hood of the cloak was drawn over my head, Chevelle standing a good distance away, facing the trees.
 I was watching him as two men drew near.
 I hadn’t seen them; they must have been concealed, or camouflaged by magic as I had been days before.
 The tassels decorating their long robes identified them as members of council, but I wasn’t familiar with the two.
 They mustn’t have been from the village.
 As they approached Chevelle cautiously, I examined their insignia.

Thomas would drag out a “rock” of cocaine from the massive pile and crack it open as if he was cutting a diamond.
 The story of its origin and quality were described as if you were listening to a reading from a science fiction novelist.
 To watch these people hang on every word of his bullshit was sickening to me.
 Their wild eyes and grinding jaws were just the physical part of their bizarre behavior.
 People would hover next to windows, peeking out every few seconds, check the locks on the same doors over and over again as their paranoia increased with every line they snorted.
 There was no deterring Thomas from his occupation, as he believed himself invincible—as all drug dealers do.
 I had watched other old friends get hauled off to jail and I didn’t want the same for my brother.
 One afternoon, I called Thomas and a strange voice picked up the phone.
 I asked for Thomas and the person on the phone said, “He is unavailable right now, but tell me what you want and I will get it ready for you to pick up.” It was obviously a cop, and I knew my brother was probably sitting there in handcuffs while they set up every idiot who called for drugs, then collected them like goldfish as they swam into the net.
 I called my mother and told her I thought Thomas had been busted; time would confirm he had.

9.Highest priority must be given to controlling and reversing the proliferation of small arms in line with the determined international measures employed to curb hijacking.
 As an immediate first step, these weapons should be classified and a UN register created to monitor their manufacture and sale.
 Agreements should be negotiated between major arms suppliers to severely restrict production and sales.
 Strong sanctions must be instituted to discourage states from actively or passively abetting small arms proliferation, especially to non-state actors.
 10.UN action to curb the international trade in major armaments needs to go further than the existing Arms Register.
 Arms exports to areas identified by the UN as trouble spots should be banned by international law.
 An independent agency should be established to verify the submissions from arms-exporting states.
 Major arms exporters should agree to consult the Security Council in advance about large orders received for destabilizing weapons and, where appropriate, coordinate actions to limit the size of arms transfers.
 11.Narcotic drug production and trafficking must be treated as threats to international peace and security.
 The strongest possible sanctions should be instituted under the UN against countries that permit or support these activities.

"What keeps the plane in the air."
 Marie couldn't wait to feel the airplane move.
 It was hard to believe that it could stay up in the air.
 She'd seen airplanes before, but she'd never been in one.
 She didn't even know anyone who had.
 The plane began rolling forward!
 Squeezing Rick's hand harder, Marie listened carefully as the flight attendant explained what to do in emergencies.
 When she'd finished, Marie pointed to an overhead panel and asked Rick, "Is this where the oxygen masks fall from?"
 "I think so."
 "Haven't you ever put one on?"

He tackled me.
 I fell and my head whacked the concrete floor.
 The next I knew, several guys were pounding various parts of me.
 I couldn’t seem to move from the waist up.
 Maybe one or more of them held me down.
 But I threw a few kicks.
 Either they accomplished my intention or Tony or someone pulled the Polish guy off me.
 Then the others followed.
 I heaved myself up and made for the door.
 Outside, with the temperature something below zero, I trudged and slid up the sidewalk the few blocks to Tony’s place.

 Brandon left our home with little in his hands and got into what was once a nice little car, but was now something appropriate for a salvage yard with body damage, a driver’s door that wouldn’t open, and water leaking through missing door seals.
 Brandon had to get in from the passenger side of this wreck of a car, symbolic of his wreck of a life.
 My wife and I held each other as we watched him back out of the driveway.
 He couldn’t even look at us as he drove away to God knows where.

 Our son was 6’2” about 135 pounds and addicted to one of the most powerful drugs on the street: Oxycontin.

 Steed’s voice was low, wary.
 “He didn’t mean you, Frey.” I turned, unable to stand the bloody vision in my peripheral.
 The tracker’s words waited in Chevelle’s hand.
 “Okay,” I said, feeling slightly detached from myself.
 “Let’s try it.” Chevelle’s disbelief was more than evident as he shot back, “No.” Ruby spoke up.
 “It could be a trick.
 He’ll need to try it on someone else first.” Someone else?
 Who else was bound?
 She could see I was prepared to argue.

I mumbled something I hoped sounded intelligible and headed towards the bathroom.
 I passed Mr. Simms and another teacher on my way out, but apparently I looked as awful as I felt.
 They just shot me stern looks rather than stopping me to ask what had happened.
 It wasn't until I'd finished dry-heaving and was trying to clean myself back up, that I wondered where they'd been.
 The school building wasn't that big.
 If they'd really been trying to break up the fight, they should have arrived minutes earlier.
 I thought about hiding in the bathroom for a while, but that was exactly the kind of place a girl like Cassie would want to catch me.
 Instead I took a deep breath and walked outside.
 Britney was waiting for me.
 By her expression she'd decided on being mad.

I hated this, if I was aware of it—I really don’t remember.
 Keep in mind, all I wanted to do was play my guitar and write songs.
 And I was writing at an astonishing clip and artists were picking up on it, and, well, the money started coming in.
 See, in a way, I was fortunate.
 I never had to sack groceries at Piggly Wiggly or teach school, or cut lawns.
 Writing songs, I learned early, brought in the bucks.
 And a lot of the talent coming out of Nashville, well, a lot of those guys were singing my stuff.
 See, at that time, everyone wanted to play and sing, but not everyone could write.
 So I wrote.
 And, even if we never performed any of it, which we didn’t, they were my songs, and they were popping up on the radio.

Lisa stood abruptly, looked rightfully angry and simply said, “It looks like you are busy,” and walked away.
 I thought my chances of getting her phone number were gone forever as she gathered up her girlfriend and left.
 Well, I did have “two birds in the hand” and it was Valentine’s Day so I managed to do with what I had and I just needed to find a way to track my future wife down .
 .
 .
 later.
 I did talk to my mother the next morning and told her that I had met the woman I was going to marry—and it wasn’t either of the two brunettes in my bed.
 Gimme a break, it was the eighties!
 The bartender made a call for me to his girlfriend in an attempt to get my dream girl’s number.
 I knew it wouldn’t be easy because as it turns out she knew of me through high school and my reputation preceded me.

Durien was working so hard trying to heal you, but your body is so hard to work with.
 He says that the same innate magical ability that makes your body so strong also requires a lot of power to heal.
 Normally Durien can heal even a very seriously wounded person, but he could barely keep you and Doi’van alive.
 I had to leave and run to Fariste to get Jordaan to come.” She was smiling like the sun as she spoke.
 “He was so good to come and just leave at the last moment,” she added.
 Rodregas thought she was going to start hugging the Nymph again, but she caught herself and came over to him and gave him a careful hug and started fussing with his pillows.
 Rodregas wanted to pull her closer and inhale her scent.
 He had thought that he was going to die, an experience that Rodregas of late knew too often.
 He wanted to pull Imeralda down into the bed and celebrate being alive.
 His body was probably too weak to do more than cuddle, but Imeralda seemed to be acting very friendly with the healer.

It wasn't the best lunch he could offer a guest from the 1920s, but it was the only thing he could think of to prepare in the microwave.
 Marie seemed fascinated by it.
 "Lasagna in ten minutes.
 Incredible."
 She touched a forkful to her tongue, finding that it was too hot.
 She blew it and then tasted it.
 "Delicious."
 "Not really.
 But I'll make you a good dinner."
 She enjoyed her lunch, the conversation as well as the food.

CM: 	Tell me how you and Lorelei met.
 BG:  	Hoo.
 Was that a smooth transition?
 Did I miss something?
 From Van Morrison to Lorelei.
 That’s a story, isn’t it, sweet?
 Um.
 It was at the Shell.
 Black Lung was playing, one of our first headlining gigs, I think.
 I came off stage after the encore, after we’d done a cooking version of “I Love my Aunt Jemima,” Skippy going wild like a man possessed, and maybe he was, man, maybe he was.

“She was Satan’s mistress,” a musician, who wishes to remain anonymous, summed her up.
 That first night Buddy went home with her.
 What happened there is shrouded in mystery, except Skippy recalls Buddy saying, “She had the most beautiful sex I’ve ever seen.
 It tasted like mushrooms and ginger ale.
 And its musk stayed on me for days, like it had gone subcutaneous, like it had replaced my own body odor.” Perhaps this was her hex: Ruthah: The perfume of Immortality.
 Others talk about the size and welcoming essence of Lorelei’s breasts.
 Buddy was mothered; he fed there like a suckling, like a child.
 It wasn’t love but it was something between the sacred and the profane.
 Some say Lorelei was responsible for the beginning of the slide downward for Buddy, filling his head with ideas of stardom, of leaving the backwash of Memphis and making it in a real town like L.A. or Boston.
 Buddy listened to Lorelei, we know that, for better or worse.

He apologized for the damage his addiction had caused.
 He looked at his mother and me and apologized for more than I can list.
 He repeated many of the apologies’ that he had confessed during his many candid phone calls.
 He looked at his little brother Bryce and apologized for disappointing him and endangering him.
 He said he was sorry for introducing him to pot so many years before.
 He asked for his forgiveness and thanked him for his help and encouragement to get through this program.
 He looked at my mother, his grandmother “Grammy” and apologized for putting her through the same nightmare a second time, as she had been through this with my older brother, Thomas.
 He looked at Uncle Thomas and thanked him for getting him into a program that saved his life.
 He thanked staff members and students by name, as he looked them directly in the eyes.
 He made amends to all of us and he unsuccessfully tried to fight back the tears as he continued.

“We must go north where we are needed most.”
 The two ran through the town, listening for sounds of battle.
 The worst seemed to be about the middle of Celed and steadily working its way south.
 They encountered a few soldiers as they hurried there.
 All died before they had the chance to swing their blades.
 “At last!” Felewen cried, staring out from a side alley.
 They were behind a group of ten soldiers battling a pair of elven warriors who stood back to back.
 “Make haste, they need us!”
 Felewen charged, desperate to arrive before her brethren were overwhelmed.
 Aurelia stepped into the street and summoned her magic.

Man, I sound like Rolling Stone.
 What I mean is that rock wouldn’t have held it’s place if it hadn’t shifted, if the words didn’t start to mean something.
 It was time.
 It was time for music to mean something.
 Dylan, The Beatles, they led the way.
 They said, you know, show us the plan, you don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.
 And the kids sat up and listened.
 It was coming, this revolution of meaning, this concentration on the word.
 And, all along, behind it like a dark river, ran the beat, the melody, a sort of communication device that was both insidious and right out there in the open.
 See, rock wasn’t subversive to the people who wanted to know.

It slammed into Seth’s side and he fell to the ground.
 NO!
 I wanted to scream.
 NO, Seth!
 I saw Seth squirm as Kojas walked towards him.
 I heard him chuckle.
 “Seth,” Kojas said.
 “Seth, oh when will you learn?” Seth groaned and grabbed at his sword, but Kojas kicked it away.
 Then he slashed his sword across Seth’s face.
 I saw the thin blue line well up on his cheek.

It was comforting, but Ruby wasted no time in getting to training.
 She immediately trounced me.
 Repeatedly.
 I felt all kinds of defeated before we’d gone half an hour.
 After watching us for a while, Steed stepped in to save me.
 “Frey”—he’d converted to the nickname the others used in place of the sunnier ones—“why don’t you take a break for a while?
 Let us spar so you can watch.
 We’ll give you a few pointers.” I didn’t know if I liked the idea of the group sparring, whether it gave me a break from the torture or not, but Grey stepped forward and my opinion no longer mattered.
 “Just watch and learn.” I backed away and sat cross-legged on the ground.
 Ruby joined me; I could tell she was excited.

Or do the lyrics come first?
 BG:  	Have we already talked about this?
 Why does this sound familiar?
 Maybe I’m deja vuing.
 Anyway, I do it both ways.
 Sometimes the lyrics come out, you know, like a poem, when I’m shaving or in the bath.
 Or first thing in the morning, you have to jump from bed and scribble them down.
 Like the phrase “Her glances could break arms.”  I just woke up with that, you know.
 Those are gifts.
 I don’t know where they come from.

I waited while we made another quarter of a journey, him gracefully, me not quite so much, around the floor, before opening my mouth to speak, but he beat me to it.
 "I don't suppose either of us talk about our dads much.
 I'm not pushing, but if you ever need to talk about him, about what happened, I'll listen.
 I'll even try to suppress the natural male instinct to present advice or solutions."
 I missed another step, but I wasn't fighting off a panic attack, I was just shocked that his words hadn't triggered one.
 Maybe it was just a function of the simple passage of time, but that didn't feel like the right answer.
 Wrapped inside his right arm as I was, the pleasant tingle surging through me wherever our skin touched, it seemed utterly impossible anything could ever have that kind of power to hurt me again.
 I regained my footing, and it wasn't until Alec ceased moving that I realized the music had stopped.
 "Sorry, the stipulation was two decent songs, and then the DJ could play three of whatever he was in the mood for."
 "It's okay, I actually need to sit down for a minute."

 Jim – Not to me particularly.

 Jim – It was Gene, during his ‘protesting God’ phase, when he would stand outside churches with a sign that said ‘God sucks’ or something like that.
 Art – I remember that.
 I’m glad he finally grew out of it.
 Though he chose an odd thing to move on to.

It was like walking down the lane managed to put things back in perspective for me.
 How could I be put out about something I hadn't ever actually believed was possible?
 I almost refused to believe my eyes when I came around the bend in our lane and saw a black Mustang parked on the side of the road.
 Brandon stood up from where he'd been leaning against the sports car and flashed me a blinding smile.
 He moved towards me with a casual grace that made little shivers run through me despite my earlier decision not to let his interest, or lack thereof, affect me.
 "I had a bet with myself that you weren't going to wait.
 Somehow the fact I just lost doesn't matter now."
 It didn't seem possible he was talking to me, that anyone so gorgeous could mean something like that about me.
 I opened my mouth, maybe to laugh the comment off, or otherwise hedge my bets against the humiliation and inevitable mocking laughter.
 Whatever it was I'd intended on saying evaporated away the instant he reached out and slowly slid his finger down the side of my face.

They make you stronger.” I looked over my shoulder to see June standing stiffly.
 “Thanks,” I whispered.
 “Thanks June.” “Good luck, Jazell.” I opened the door and saw that Emily and Jason were also coming out of their rooms.

 Good luck, June’s voice whispered one more time.
 Yeah, I was going to need it.
 Big time.
 Seth, I’m coming, I thought, and I meant it.
 Hold on.
 Then I walked out to face my destiny.

Peace building has thus far been defined as post-conflict actions to support reconstruction and to strengthen and solidify peace.
 The concept needs to be broadened to include pre-conflict actions and expanded to encompass a wider array of potentially destabilizing factors that lead to conflicts.
 The Commission supports the establishment of an International Centre jointly operated by the UN Security Council and UNESCO to implement peace-building programmes.
 Peace-building activities should be expanded to address security threats issuing from environmental degradation, poverty, migration of population and refugees.
 Many cases of ethnic conflict have an under lying basis of economic deprivation that must be addressed before tensions will permanently subside.
 Others can be mitigated by the introduction of positive economic incentives for cooperation.
 Economic cooperation is already dissipating ethnic tensions and conflict in the Middle East.
 It can be creatively fostered in the Balkans and elsewhere.
 In other cases, the modification of the electoral and constitutional systems in a culturally appropriate manner can reduce or eliminate tensions in ethnically divided countries.
 International assistance is also needed for coping with tensions arising from the sharing of natural resources – particularly water resources – and chemical or radioactive pollution of air, soil and waterways.

He likes to create a nuisance and a spectacle.
 He’s better at the former than at the latter, but he does try.
 If people found out that his father beat him, well they would explain away his actions with some text-book psychology and do more to try and ignore him.
 That would really piss Gene off.
 I think that he just likes the attention that he receives.
 Johnny – If it’s true…
 Jim – If what’s true?
 Johnny – The beatings.
 I mean.
 With all the crap that mom pulled, well, she never once hit me.

He circled around and dashed into the store.
 Marie had just sat down in front of the TV with a dish of ice cream when she heard the garage door open.
 How odd--why would Rick come home in the middle of the day?
 Remembering how he'd seemed to feel ill yesterday, she set her ice cream down and ran to meet him.
 Rick was just getting out of his car.
 "Hi, sweetheart."
 "Hi.
 What are you doing home so early?
 Are you sick?"

If she knew he was waiting for her, she’d have a harder time detaching herself from 2011.
 Marie awoke before dawn the next morning—as she had the morning she’d walked into 2011.
 She put on all her 1927 clothes, even the stockings that she’d stopped wearing once she’d gotten used to her comfortable 2011 clothes.
 She headed for the stairs but then stopped.
 Quietly she approached Rick’s door and opened it just a little.
 Rick was sprawled on his back, a sheet covering him from the waist down.
 Tears filled her eyes.
 She’d miss him so much.
 The sky was turning a dark gray when she walked into the garden.
 Grace, their cook, would be getting up soon.

The two guards ignored his threats, knowing the difficulty of using a whip in melee combat.
 Casting magic would also be a great risk.
 They only needed to close the distance and Qurrah was theirs.
 However, knowing was easier than doing.
 Much easier.
 When the two tried to close in, Qurrah lashed out with his whip.
 One ducked away in fear.
 The other managed to deflect the lash and then charge, his sword leading.
 The flaming leather curled back around like a living thing.
 Qurrah sent it at the nearest opponent.

It would significantly reduce the costs of security for members, possibly by up to 50 or 75 per cent, without compromising their legitimate security needs.
 The more members, the lower the defence expenditure required by each, both because the collective force would be larger and because the number of potential adversaries would be reduced proportionately.
 The organization of a World Army, run on well-defined and transparent lines with appropriate mechanisms for control and responsiveness, would help eliminate the need for countries to maintain their own large standing armies.
 Ultimately this could enable other nations to follow the lead of Costa Rica, which abolished its military forces several decades ago.
 National Sovereignty and International Responsibility
 The recent calamities in Rwanda and Somalia following the outbreak of civil and ethnic war, and in Bosnia following the breakaway of several Yugoslav republics, demonstrate the need for substantially improving international mechanisms for war prevention, peacemaking and peace keeping, and for protection of basic human rights both between and within states.
 The effort of the international community to deal with these events has brought to the fore fundamental issues regarding national sovereignty and the responsibilities of the world community.
 The very definition and sanctity of the state have been blurred by the determination of ethnic groups in various nations to declare independence from their parent bodies, and the inability or unwillingness of national governments to maintain law and order and provide basic security for their citizens.
 The role of other states, regional organizations and international agencies in giving explicit or implicit support to these movements has further complicated the task of formulating just and practical solutions.
 These events raise questions about the rights of both nations and their citizens that have to be addressed theoretically before the role of international organizations in these affairs can be determined properly.

“Only the Immortalist have ever taken on the essence of a Celestial Beast as they get ready to become gods,” Imeralda continued.
 Her eyes wandering around the arena, waiting.
 Her voice had a casual quality, but Rodregas sensed she thought this very important.
 “When Doi’van sees you, he thinks of you as one of the blood, a noble in fact, if not by birth.
 Most of the men and women in this circle are that; faster, stronger because they descend from a Celestial god.
 But you are not that.
 The Celestial Beasts all represent something.” She paused, looking at him for the first time.
 “What does The Lion represent, Rodregas?” she asked.
 Rodregas was silent for a moment and then said, “Strength, the Hunter, and Protector of the Pride.” He spoke words that he knew he had learned as a child at temple.
 Imeralda nodded, a smile starting to appear on her face.

"Yes.
 And I think a September wedding would be perfect."
 They discussed bridesmaids and flowers and gardens.
 Marie would wear her mother's wedding gown, which had been carefully stored away for the last 28 years.
 Marie's grandmother had worn it as well, and when Marie took it off after her own wedding, it would go into storage for her daughter.
 Davis chose the next day to approach her father.
 "Come in, my boy," Jefferson Tranton told him, waving the young man into a large, comfortable chair opposite his own in his den.
 "You seemed rather anxious when you telephoned last night."
 "I have to confess that I was.
 Still am."

Alec let his mother take both of his hands in hers.
 "I know you do, Mother.

 Alec's mom tossed her head.
 "You barely remember him.
 Rachel's a good girl, but she was so young when he died.
 She can't really miss him.
 Not like I miss him."
 For a second I thought he was going to argue with her.
 His tired smile had the feel of resignation, of something that'd been well argued over the years.

 “Let’s hope not,” Seth interrupted me.
 Oh course; being ourselves, we don’t have any luck at all.
 The sky darkened even more, not that I thought that was possible.
 The mist swirled and a cold chill that ran shivers down my spine ascended on us.
 And out of the mist stepped a dark figure.
 Kojas.

“As I lift your sword up, so do I lift up your honor and make it mine.” As he finished the oath he handed the sword back to Doi’van, who responded with the final, “My arm shall be your arm, my sword your sword, my honor your honor.” Rodregas had expected to have to claim his followers as Oath Bond, but a knight would never have demanded to see the oath.
 He felt guilt seize his stomach at having been mistaken and knowing Doi’van had been forced to swear the oath, due to not wanting to blow their cover.
 Rodregas swore to himself that he would lift the oath as soon as they could be free, but the fact that Doi’van had trusted him enough to say such an oath out loud, which could put his very soul in jeopardy, was a powerful statement to their growing friendship.
 Rodregas looked back at the sorcerer who actually seemed surprised at watching the oath sworn, “Satisfied, Sir?” The sorcerer waved his hand and without a word went back to his chair sitting down as a king to his throne.
 The Knight Captain called for a squire, who he commanded to find them a room.
 Rodregas sensed that the Knight Captain was not happy with what had happened, but he said no word of apology.
 As the three were led away, Rodregas asked the boy the name of the sorcerer at the table.
 “That is the Immortalist Van’dret, Ambassador to the Knights from the Guild.
 He is very powerful you know.
 We are told to do whatever he commands, but also told to stay as far away from him as possible,” said the young boy, who could not have been much more than twelve years old.

I've always been passable at drawing scenery, but anything more complicated than a stick figure gives me fits, so art was out too.
 Unless possibly the teacher liked Neolithic cave drawings.
 By the time I surfaced from my musings, Mrs. Pendely had printed my schedule out on an ancient piece of machinery, handed me a map of the school and a locker assignment, and then dashed off a handwritten note to my first teacher.
 I somehow found my first class before the bell rang.
 Mrs. Sorenson, my biology teacher, was a skinny old woman with curly white hair that looked like Greek paintings of Medusa.
 She made me introduce myself to the class and then let me slink over to my assigned seat.
 I left the class even more depressed than I'd been when I woke up.
 I'd kind of known I'd have an incredible amount of material to catch up on from the first part of the semester.
 I hadn't anticipated that every other student was going to spend the class carefully ignoring me.
 I'd never really fit in, but this was unbelievable.

The old healer immediately left the room.
 “Rodregas, you look much better than last I saw you.
 But what is so important that it takes me away from a very important nap?” Doi’van’s body looked worse for the wear, but his eyes showed his natural curiosity and intelligence.
 Rodregas did not think he actually minded coming over to his room.
 Rodregas smiled and thought that given the way Doi’van talked about pain when training them with the staff, that he must be immune to mere pain anyhow.
 Imeralda repeated Jordaan’s question.
 “Jordaan asked Rodregas if you two were related as being Hellborn is very rare in the Eastern Realms.” And Doi’van’s surprised expression Imeralda added, “While I cannot sense the feel and make up of a body like I can a tree, I do know the feel of magic, and I had thought a few times that I sensed the feel of Brimstone and Fire not just with Doi’van, but with both of you.” Rodregas could feel his eyes widen as Imeralda confirmed what Jordaan had felt.
 He had been thinking while Doi’van was being fetched and he had a question for his friend.
 “Doi’van, you were swept up quickly after you entered the Eastern Realms; you clearly have a strong physical essence and strong magical power.
 The Immortalists should not be interested in either.

Jim – But…
 Liz – Not to mention that they’ve known each other forever and that they live in the same house.
 Jim – But…
 Liz – But what?
 Jim – Well I was just going to say that Johnny hates humanity as a whole, so how did it happen.
 Liz – I think John finally let it go.
 He seems to have learned that from Eugene.
 Jim – Is that so?
 Liz – Seems to be.
 Jim – I wonder what Eugene has happened to learn from Johnny.

On the half-orc ran.
 Innocent blood stained his sword as life after life ended.
 Harruq felt no remorse and saw no pain.
 The blood haze of rage and dark magic blocked all.
 Man, woman, child, it didn’t matter.
 They all died.
 Only seven managed to keep ahead of his berserking madness: a mother, her two children, a few farmers, and their daughters.
 They dared to hope.
 As they ran, a strange sight met their eyes.
 In the distance were hundreds of bodies lined in perfect formation.

Jim – Why shouldn’t I?
 Liz – I don’t know, it just seems that in movies, when a character’s parent meets another person or gets married the character is always against it.
 And then they usually seem to come up with a scheme to get their parents back together.
 Jim – A scheme to get mom and dad back together, I never thought of that…hmmm, that actually wouldn’t be a bad idea.
 Liz – Are you serious?
 Jim – Hell no I’m not serious.
 Mom’s leaving was the best thing that could have ever happened to our family, I’m glad to be rid of her.
 Liz – Will Johnny feel the same way?
 Jim – Johnny hates mom.
 I don’t know how he’ll take dad’s new love interest.

They were so worn, it must have been in place for centuries.
 The leather soles of my shoes skimmed over ancient stone, the bridge curving gently before flattening out into a worn dirt path on the other side.
 It was more traveled than I would have liked, so I swung wide, through the trees instead.
 The wind shifted and the scent of roasting meat assaulted me, dragging my attention, my feet, its way.
 Despite my concerns about other elves, my stomach tightened, my mouth watering as I followed it through the trees.
 They broke into a small clearing, and there in the center stood a cloaked figure, kneeling down as he turned a meat-covered spit.
 Pressed tight behind an oak tree, I shuffled sideways to get a better view.
 I was sure it was an elf, male, from his size.
 The smell of real food was consuming, and I was watching the cooked meat roll over the flame as I moved again.
 A dry leaf crushed beneath my foot.

People would come and go as they purchased their cocaine all day and all night.
 The big buyers would be treated to a sampling right out of the giant pile.
 Thomas would drag out a “rock” of cocaine from the massive pile and crack it open as if he was cutting a diamond.
 The story of its origin and quality were described as if you were listening to a reading from a science fiction novelist.
 To watch these people hang on every word of his bullshit was sickening to me.
 Their wild eyes and grinding jaws were just the physical part of their bizarre behavior.
 People would hover next to windows, peeking out every few seconds, check the locks on the same doors over and over again as their paranoia increased with every line they snorted.
 There was no deterring Thomas from his occupation, as he believed himself invincible—as all drug dealers do.
 I had watched other old friends get hauled off to jail and I didn’t want the same for my brother.
 One afternoon, I called Thomas and a strange voice picked up the phone.

But Rodregas was able to hold on to his big steed and absorb the blow.
 His opponent landed on the ground with a crash.
 When you were knocked off your mount you had the choice to get back on again and face the same opponent.
 The winner of two out of three rounds won the whole match.
 Rodregas’ opponent did not get up.
 He circled around and checked on the man.
 Rodregas could not tell if the man was alive or dead so he dismounted and took off the man’s helm.
 The man was covered in sweat and was surprisingly old.
 He was clearly alive, if unconscious.
 A few young squires ran out and helped to drag the man to get medical care.

How this happens, why this happens, is secondary to the fact that it does.
 I can listen to “Frankie Lee and Judas Priest” or “Visions of Johanna” or “On the Road Again” or “Clothesline Saga” or “Watching the River Flow” and feel that there are angels within humankind.
 I can feel that we are not all lost in the caliginous wastes of our hopelessly chaotic lives.
 Art redeems us.
 This is the seed I’m seeking, the truth I’m trying in my clumsy way to impart.
 Dylan is art, for us anyway, for what we’re talking about.
 Now, knowing Bob, I have to say, he’s a humble prophet, you know?
 But I still wish I had a clearer picture of how it all happened, to me, Dylanwise.
 Perhaps the mystery is more apropos.
 Perhaps mysteries always are.

Alec smiled and reached over to the backpack as he sat up.
 I let him pull me up and then felt my face freeze as he pulled out one of the largest velvet boxes I'd ever seen.
 "Alec, no."
 "It wasn't that expensive and you've already told me I could."
 "I didn't think you'd have something already ready and waiting to ambush me with.
 I thought I'd at least have a few days to prepare myself."
 He smiled again and I gingerly held my hand out.
 The green velvet lid swung up to reveal the most delicate necklace I'd ever seen.
 It was a thin glass heart set inside a slightly larger heart.
 "I saw it when I was in Virginia last week for business and thought of you."

"By the way you were looking at me."
 "How was I looking at you?"
 "Like you wanted me to kiss you."
 He grinned again as he reached for the eggs.
 She frowned, trying to remember what expression she must have had on her face that night.
 But she hadn't been thinking about how she looked; she'd been thinking about how he looked.
 And how his lips would feel on hers.
 It was as they were cleaning up after breakfast that inspiration struck her.
 Handing him a tub of butter, she caught his gaze, holding it as she thought about the way he'd kissed her yesterday afternoon.
 Entranced by Marie's beautiful hazel eyes, Rick drew her close and bent his head to kiss her.

By focusing on critical threats that can only be met through common action, it has changed the way people and nations think about the world and each other.
 A consciousness of One World is emerging above the din of individualistic and nationalistic self-interest.
 This new perspective will enable us to generate effective strategies for addressing many problems that have thus far defied solution.
 In addition to these nine factors, two powerful revolutions are re-drawing the landscape of the global society and generating an unparalleled dynamism for rapid progress on the issues of critical concern to humanity.
 Democracy, Peace and Development
 The first is a revolutionary movement from authoritarianism to democracy that has travelled around the world during the past decade.
 The initial wave swept through Latin America in the early 1980s, replacing military regimes in Peru, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Paraguay and Bolivia.
 In 1979, 12 out of 19 Latin American countries had authoritarian governments.
 By 1993, every country except Cuba and Haiti had a democratically elected government.
 Glasnost and perestroika in the USSR initiated a second and more powerful tide of freedom that expanded rapidly through Eastern Europe and then to other continents, in the same way that India’s attainment of freedom from colonial rule gave birth to a host of freedom movements and new nations after the Second World War.

I was usually a late sleeper, but the next morning I was out of the house early.
 I wanted to get away before I had to face Fannie in the middle of her wine hangover, and I knew Junnie could tell me if Evelyn had turned the town or Council against me.
 I rushed up the path and through the village gate, keeping my head down.
 No one generally went out of their way to speak to me, but I didn’t want to take any chances.
 The other elves didn’t have much use for one who wasn’t able to contribute.
 My lack of magic and skill had put me far from their minds.
 Except in the case of Evelyn, who sought to raise herself by lowering me, but always with such a thick coating of sweetness.
 And it didn’t help that I couldn’t pull off the polish or cheer of the other elves.
 I slipped around the village and through Junnie’s back yard, darting past a trellis toward the door.
 As I ducked under the hanging ivy, I caught my foot on a vine and stumbled forward, cursing as I nearly ran into a boulder.

Skill development programmes in areas such as hybrid seed production, floriculture, inland aquaculture, vegetables and poultry can be particularly beneficial.
 Promotion of micro-level credit institutions and savings programmes can generate capital for the establishment by women of small rural enterprises.
 FOOD SECURITY IN AFRICA
 The present prognosis for Africa resembles the pessimistic assessment of Asia in the 1960s that projected most Asians would face starvation in the 1970s.
 Over the past two decades, total food production in Africa has grown at exactly the same rate as for the world as a whole, but high levels of population growth have resulted in declining availability of food per capita in many countries, particularly in the sub-Saharan region.
 This suggests that a grim outcome is not inevitable, if concerted action is taken now.
 Several factors have impeded achievement of higher agricultural growth rates in the region: political instability and civil unrest, poor macro-economic and agricultural policies, drought, and physical difficulties in farming in some areas.
 The ravages of war have had the most devastating effect, but inadequate and counter-productive policies have also had a major impact.
 Low mandated prices for agricultural products have acted as a disincentive to producers.
 State control of farm support systems, including marketing, transportation and input supply, is highly bureaucratic, inefficient, and, often, corrupt.

Conclusion
 Seven years ago the threat of nuclear war between the superpowers loomed large in the minds of people everywhere.
 The euphoria generated by the end of the Cold War led to high expectations of peace and a ‘peace dividend’ the world over.
 Yet excitement soon turned to disappointment as the full anticipated results of these magnificent accomplishments did not immediately materialize.
 Then, as attention turned to more mundane problems closer to home, the sense of relief and celebration was replaced by growing concern over the increasing prominence of other threats to international security: some of these were aggravated by the new positive developments, while others had not previously seemed so serious by comparison with the threat of nuclear annihilation.
 The end of political confrontation between East and West, the sudden conversion of authoritarian communist states into demo cratic market economies, and substantial cuts in global defence spending were accompanied by increasing political instability and ethnic violence in the many parts of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, by the horren dous loss of life due to civil and ethnic strife in several African countries, by growing concern over drugs and violent crime in the West, by the danger of nuclear terrorism resulting from potential theft of Soviet weapons, and by pressure on defence producers to compensate for reduced domestic defence budgets by increasing arms exports.
 This surprising turn of events has led some to re-examine the incredible achievements of the period and conclude that they were either vastly overstated or, perhaps, even illusory.
 Others have come to take these achievements for granted.
 Still others have simply forgotten how much things have really changed.
 But the most important realization to be derived from these events is of the inherent defect in attempts to address the factors underlying international security in a piece meal manner.

 Johnny – I don’t watch Gene do anything.

 Jim – Maybe if you’re lucky, and ask nicely, he’ll teach you about Canada.

But not before my eyes caught a flash of blue.
 Emily and I parked our bikes and headed into the woods and towards the clearing.
 We stepped into it, and I took in the familiar feeling.
 Out of all the places we’ve all been, this place felt the safest, as if it were surrounded by a good force, not bad for once.
 We often met here when we weren’t all together.
 I sat down next to Emily on a log.
 Minutes later Jason and Seth emerged from the trees.
 They weren’t smiling or doing anything suspicious so I figured we were safe, for now.
 They sat down across from us.
 I noticed that Seth was avoiding my eyes.

He moved so fast it took a moment to understand.
 The hood of the cloak was drawn over my head, Chevelle standing a good distance away, facing the trees.
 I was watching him as two men drew near.
 I hadn’t seen them; they must have been concealed, or camouflaged by magic as I had been days before.
 The tassels decorating their long robes identified them as members of council, but I wasn’t familiar with the two.
 They mustn’t have been from the village.
 As they approached Chevelle cautiously, I examined their insignia.
 Even if they weren’t from the village, I still needed council members to unbind me, and I had a sudden urge to go to them.
 But I remembered my warning to be still.
 “She’s not going back.” Chevelle’s tone, level and uncompromising, caught my attention.

The high-pitched scream of a performance engine pulled me away from my absurd musings.
 James' blue and white Accord passed us doing the better part of twice the legal speed limit, and then flipped around with the distinctive squeal of overworked tires.
 Alec veered up onto the road as I looked back to find that even as fast as he was running, the Accord was still gaining on us at a prodigious rate.
 As the car pulled even with us, Alec smoothly reached over, pulled the passenger door open, pried me off of his back, and slid me into the front seat without losing even a single step.
 If everything had happened at something approaching normal speed, I probably would've started hyperventilating, but it was all so quick my mind didn't have a chance to fully register what was going on before I was safely ensconced next to James.
 Jasmin and Isaac appeared alongside the road, materializing where there'd only been trees a half-second before.
 Faster than I would have believed possible, all three of the shape shifters piled into the moving car, and then James stomped on the gas hard enough to break triple digits before slowing slightly for the first turn.
 The mirror on my side of the car was perfectly positioned for me to be able to see three or four flashes of tawny brown sliding through the trees before the winding road carried us out of sight.
 Alec nodded as I looked back and met his eyes.
 "They were pretty close.

I drew in a startled breath as two more figures came into view.
 A pair of slender elves stepped in sync as they stopped just outside the group.
 They were tall and lean, dressed in robes the color of ash that only accentuated their shocking silver hair.
 I was convinced the moonlight must have been exaggerating it.
 And then I jumped again as, on either side of them, two beasts walked forward to stand just in front of the twinned elves.
 Steed brushed an arm against mine, mumbling under his breath, “Yeah, they’re not from around here.” I felt myself leaning on Chevelle for support.
 “Rhys and Rider Strong,” he said from behind me.
 They nodded and I was surprised the small gesture also seemed in step.
 A strange whine emanated from one of the dogs as they shifted to sit on their haunches.
 By their size, I might have guessed they were wolves, but I’d never known a wolf to be tamed.

 Liz – who else knows about this?
 Jim – Just me and my dad.
 Even Johnny doesn’t know, which I guess is a good thing, maybe, I don’t know if Johnny would give Eugene an easier time if he did know.
 Johnny’s temper has been bad since mom and dad divorced.
 Liz – Poor Eugy, he’s such an imaginative sweet guy, even though he’s a goof most of the time.
 Even with his ‘evil plans’.
 Jim – Just don’t let on that you know, he’s really embarrassed by it.

The Real World
 I started college and rented an apartment with Kenny Niedermeyer who was suffering more than any of us over Eric’s death, since the car was his and Sylvia blamed him.
 She would call and scream “Murderer!” and accuse him of stealing the twenty dollars Eric took with him that day.
 Here's something she wrote and sent him: Jingle for Rope Jumpers Teddy Bear, Teddy Bear, Eric's dead.
 They pushed him, and they beat him and they smashed him in the head.
 He gurgled and he growled, he suffered and he bled.
 Teddy Bear, Teddy Bear, Eric's dead.
 Jump Michael, Jump Kenneth, Jump Edward
 Bob Williams often hung around our apartment.
 About half way through the fall semester, President Kennedy got bushwhacked.

“They await battle.”
 “Let us hope it does not come to that, Dieredon.
 Perhaps they will accept the king’s orders for now.”
 The elf shook his head.
 “You know they will not.”
 Antonil glanced at the elf, who was painted in camouflage and still wore his wicked bow slung across his back.
 He sighed.
 “You’re right.
 I do know.”
 Silence followed.

Preventive Diplomacy, Peace Making and Peace Building
 The answers to the questions regarding national sovereignty and international responsibility will determine the scope of UN preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace building in years to come.
 They must be addressed with a view to evolving valid principles of international law, rather than remaining subject to frequent reversals of public policy by member states based on the short-term impact of the media on current public opinion.
 Granted that a consensus is reached regarding these larger issues of principle, there still will remain immense problems relating to implementation, as illustrated by the recent failure of international intervention in Somalia.
 Whatever may be the limits placed on the UN’s mandate for action, it is clear that it cannot carry out that mandate effectively under the current constraints imposed on it by member states through indecisiveness, narrowly defined interests and lack of political commitment.
 Once again the inherent weaknesses in the structure of the UN organization impact negatively on its capacity to perform the tasks rightfully allotted to it.
 The absence of a unified chain of command for national forces placed under UN command – culminating in the outright refusal of field forces to follow the commands of UN field staff, inadequate training and equipping of both military staff and fighting units, poor coordination between field units from different countries and between member states and UN headquarters – and a failure to vest sufficient authority in the UN Secretary General are among the most blatant weaknesses of the present system.
 Substantive measures are needed to strengthen the UN’s capabilities to handle crises.
 First and foremost, the position of the Secretary General, who now has the diplomatic status equal to that of a prime minister of a member state, should be upgraded to that of a head of state, with full authority over the forces placed under his command by member states to carry out the decisions of the Security Council.
 Problems of control over the armed forces of member states argue for the constitution of a standing international military force, as described in the previous section of this report.

Public opinion is an even more important determinant at the international level, since the authority of global institutions is still quite limited.
 Rising ethnic and nationalistic sentiments threaten the integrity of states and impede progress toward regional cooperation and global governance in many countries, because their populations lack reliable information regarding the enormous costs of political and economic fragmentation.
 The global debate over the Uruguay Round of GATT has been obscured by lack of clear information regarding its impact on the countries involved.
 International negotiations on debt, aid and the environment are complicated by lack of awareness about the opportunities that greater economic integration will generate for all nations.
 International institutions, non-governmental agencies and the international media play an important role in providing information to the world community, but there are still huge gaps to be filled in all fields.
 A conscious and systematic effort is required at the international level to put in place both the institutions and the technology for information superhighways needed to support peace, democracy and sustainable development in the twenty-first century.
 Building Social Organization for Development
 The achievement of peace, food security and full employment cannot be accomplished without more fully utilizing one of the most creative and productive of all human resources – organization.
 The march of humanity is marked by the development of larger-scale, more complex and more efficient types of organizations to serve higher and wider social needs.
 Advances in the technology of organization, as much as advances in the technology of production, have been responsible for global progress during the present century and, especially, during the post-war period.

“That magic blue thingie is a portal,” Aurelia said, her arms crossed over her chest as she held her elbows.
 “And yes, that is how I did it.”
 Harruq shrugged, glancing about as he tried to get his bearings.
 A thought hit him, harder than any whacks of Aurelia’s staff.
 “Qurrah!” he gasped.
 “You’ve got to send me back.”
 “I can’t,” Aurelia said, her eyes fixed west.
 “What do you mean you can’t?” He stormed over and grabbed her arms.
 “Send me back, I’m telling you to!
 Qurrah’s all alone, and they’ll kill him if I don’t help him!”

Not him.
 His square jaw and even features were nothing less than perfection.
 If he ever chose to model, the editors of every major fashion magazine would have pulled out all the stops to land the contract for his debut appearance.
 The whole issue would have to be pictures of him though.
 No amount of airbrushing would suffice to allow other men to ever share the same magazine with him.
 I expected to begin hyperventilating any second, but my lungs seemed frozen.
 My body should have been screaming for oxygen.
 Instead every part of me was screaming for more of that divine face.
 He'd been looking to his left; I pried my gaze away from his profile just long enough to take in a casual tangle of dark, curly hair, and then he was turning towards me.
 Vague, traitorous hopes that the other side of his face was marred with a birthmark, or a series of ghastly scars evaporated away as I took in eyes just a few shades darker than the blue of his shirt.

 Jim – (Sits up) Right here, where I’ve been for the last twenty minutes.
 Art – Why haven’t you been helping out?
 Jim – Um, because there were already a bunch of people.
 And you didn’t need any more to get in the way.
 Besides, I wanted to catch up with Sumo here.
 Art – That stupid comic book still…
 Jim – Well yeah, I don’t know anyone in the real world named Sumo.
 Art – What about that fat kid down the block?
 Wasn’t he nicknamed Sumo?

If she'd totally abandoned him then her children would've all died."
 I felt my eyelids begin to flutter, as my breathing slowed to match Alec's.
 "Whether that was his intent or not, the Sun didn't completely abandon him, either out of respect for what they'd shared, or possibly out of concern for her children.
 Once it became apparent that the Earth and Sun were through with each other, the Moon began to court her.
 Doomed to touch only briefly during the rare solar eclipses, they nevertheless became beloved, one to the other.
 The greatest sign of the Moon's devotion to the Sun came about when he sent his children down to the Earth to watch over and protect the sunborn, or dayborn as they are most often called."
 Alec's pause was long enough that I think I nodded off, but the sound of his voice once he resumed talking pulled me back awake.
 "Originally there were just two of the moonborn, a pair of brothers called Adjam and Inock.
 Unbeknown to the Moon, the Earth had anticipated his great gesture of love, and sent forth a plague upon the land.
 As Adjam, the elder of the brothers, descended from the heavens and touched down upon the Earth, he collapsed to the ground in pain.

“Why?” “It might lead up somewhere.
 Plus, if Jason and Emily see it too, they might go down.
 It'll be easier to find each other.” “Okay,” I said and stood up.
 I brushed the dirt off my pants and followed Seth, who was walking off to the side.
 He went down to the left of the ledge and followed a steep path.
 I walked behind him and had to dig my heels in to avoid from slipping down.
 The path ended and Seth had to jump down to reach the bottom.
 He landed gracefully but almost tripped.
 I walked up to the edge of the path and jumped off.
 I flung my arms out to steady myself.

“But it will probably be harder and slower than if you were learning earlier in life.
 It requires relearning something that is almost an instinct at this point in your life.
 Part of the problem is that the spell to activate the magic in the bow is just very different than anything you have probably done before.” Rodregas knew she was speaking the truth.
 He had never thought he was going to be some powerful mage.
 The fact that Doi’van had so easily learned the spell just reminded him of how many times in his life he had failed to have the ability to succeed in things that he really wanted.
 Rodregas’ new body was very gifted, but it was still mortal and some things he would just not be able to do as well as others.
 In some ways this was reassuring, a connection to his past.
 “Can I ask you a question?” she asked.
 Rodregas smiled and said, “of course, what?” “Have you thought of trying to become a sigil warrior?
 You are a very powerful magician now.

His stay at Narconon had also exposed him to a minimalist lifestyle completely unlike his prior existence.
 He had learned he didn’t need “things” to prove anything to anybody.
 His ex-girlfriend, Tiffanie, met us at the storage unit to claim her belongings.
 She looked about twenty pounds heavier and it was good weight.
 Tiffanie had been clean and sober since her last relapse in the rehab center.
 They smiled at each other and commented on their vast physical changes.
 They knew their life as a couple was over and that they had both gone their separate ways, while both going in the same positive direction—off drugs—despite astronomical odds.
 The conversation they had was all about sobriety and how wonderful it was to be clean.
 They both had big smiles and clear eyes and they looked like a couple of healthy young people, and that is exactly what they were.
 I also took the opportunity to arrange a meeting at a Starbucks, a reunion of sorts.

He had expected them to either bolt for it or stay in the “safety” of their room.
 Instead they both casually got up and walked out, as if they were guests in a fancy inn, with all the time in the world.
 As they walked out the door both cats gave him a casual glance as he held the two doors firmly closed together bracing for the weight if they threw themselves at the doors, but they just walked by and headed up the stairs.
 He wanted to follow, but Rodregas held himself back patiently waiting until it was safe.
 They might look like lions, but he knew they were smarter than any beast, and they could be setting him up.
 Finally after waiting what seemed like forever, but was probably only about twenty minutes, Rodregas slowly made his way back up through the keep.
 When he poked his head out the entrance there was no sign of Dire Cats or chickens, but he did note a few stray feathers in the courtyard.
 Other than a few alarmed sounds from the chicken coop, it was surprisingly quiet.
 Rodregas felt a feeling of relief at the idea that the lions had eaten.
 Still, he double-checked the keep and the courtyard very carefully before bringing out the cart and the horses and loading up all his booty.

"That's better; I much prefer the happy Adri face to the scared Adri."
 "Wait, you could see me smile?
 I guess that all follows, better hearing, better sense of smell.
 Of course you'd have better vision too."
 It wasn't until I heard the note of longing in my voice that I realized what I was missing.
 Alec didn't have that same advantage, and I could feel him waiting expectantly.
 "Sorry, it's just that this all makes me think of these amazing dreams I've been having since I arrived.
 I'm transported to various places, but in every case I can hear and smell better than I can in real life.
 Not only that, everything is glowing.
 Only that isn't the right word for it.

As we drove off down the narrow road, Brandon waved.
 Could we really be getting our son back?
 We knew at least for now, he was exactly where he should be.
 He was far from the streets he once roamed and free from the drugs he once craved.
 Chapter 23: The Where, When & Why of Drugs We talked to Brandon as often as he could and we kept in touch with the counselors weekly.
 Over the next two months we received calls from our son and his counselor as he was in the part of the program where he was assigned to come clean with his family, acknowledge his behavior, and confess to the many terrible things he had done.
 The calls were very hard on us because even though they were necessary, we felt like he was getting so much better and we were getting all this bad news about stuff in the past.
 We understood that this was a necessary part of his treatment; he needed to cleanse himself and ask for our forgiveness.
 At the end of every confession he would ask if we would accept him back into the family to which we always answered yes!
 Every time Brandon called he seemed more mentally clear.

 CM: 	“It’s Not True Unless it Makes You Laugh.”
 BG:  	Right.
 That’s actually a really old song—that almost made it onto Turntable.
 I wrote that in Memphis, in Lorelei’s bedroom, right after we had made love.
 There was candlelight dancing on the walls, and outside one of those Memphis thunderstorms that seem like the end of the world, beautiful like the end of the world should be, and Lorelei was lying there naked, a vision out of Titian, and I just started singing those lyrics.
 Those were given to me, you know?
 Like they always existed but I was the one that plucked them from the ether.
 It’s weird, that’s the most Memphis song on the LP, though it really is about, what’s inside us, you know?
 What keeps us going, keeps us growing.

It should be based on the perception that the political, economic and social life of human kind is a single, inseparable whole and, therefore, that comprehensive, total strategies must be applied to resolve our problems, because partial strategies lead to partial solutions which disturb the harmony of the whole, generating unwanted side-effects.
 This knowledge should be utilized to formulate a model of development that is based on the internal dynamics of the process rather than on its external manifestations or extrapolation of future trends from past data.
 This model should become so precise that we can anticipate the impact of peace, more education, greater political freedom, rising social expectations, and high values such as guaranteed employment on the progress of society.
 This conceptual knowledge should enable us to understand and replicate fully the conditions responsible for the post-war achievements of Japan, China’s recent 20 per cent growth rate or Yugoslavia’s remarkable conquest of hyper inflation.
 A comprehensive approach will enable us to anticipate the imbalances and side-effects generated by partial initiatives and to evolve total strategies to avoid them.
 The comprehensive conceptual model needs to be complemented by the development of models for employment, food, education, trade and other fields that go beyond the national or sectoral approach to show the impact of the complex interactions that are key determinants of the development process – for instance, the impact of democracy on agriculture and of increasing agricultural productivity on employment, industrialization and trade, the impact of rising education on democratization, social tolerance for diversity, personal expectations and social stability.
 Once formulated, these conceptual models need to be applied under a variety of conditions to test their validity and demonstrate the value of a comprehensive approach to development.
 Therefore, we have proposed that the UN adopt a number of districts in different regions of the world, including crime-ridden inner cities or impoverished rural areas in industrial countries, to evolve and apply strategies for their rapid transition to a higher level of development.
 Six Goals in Education
 Once formulated, this knowledge needs to be imparted through education.

Rodregas wondered if he had said something wrong.
 While he had seen the two interact for some years, he really did not know what was appropriate for him to say in such a circumstance.
 Rodregas knew that he did not have the skills for pretending he was a powerful Immortalist sorcerer, so he said, “How many people have you killed during the past year Korin?
 And how many others have you raped or tortured?” he asked, trying to keep a calm voice.
 Now Korin looked very surprised and he started looking around.
 Rodregas saw that Korin noticed the study door, though he was working hard to not show it.
 “How many?” Rodregas repeated his question.
 “I am not sure,” Korin said.
 “For us to truly become divine we must of course develop our skills.” As Korin answered the question he took a step back.
 Rodregas quickly stepped forward and pushed him hard against the wall.

Besides, this is where you'll find the copies of all your textbooks."
 It must have been obvious I wasn't convinced, but Donovan wasn't dissuaded.
 He pointed to the cell phone, still grasped uncomfortably in my hand.
 "In the event that you need something, it is likely you can just say my name and I'll hear you.
 If not, that wonderfully infernal device is, I believe, programmed to call me if you hold down the number nine.
 I am of course completely at your service."
 I opened my mouth to protest, but moving much too quickly, even with his painful-looking limp, to be a normal human, he'd already vanished around the corner.
 I stood awkwardly in the doorway for several minutes, but I couldn't resist the draw of all those books forever.
 I finally broke down and started tracing various spines as I decided which one I'd start with.
 Unfortunately I found the textbooks before I made a final decision, and then guilt over how poorly I was doing in Biology and Spanish won out.

Maybe on account of being an only child, ever since I can remember, I have longed for a best friend to whom I could tell all the crazy stuff I think and feel.
 A best friend is what I hoped Karen Flagstad could be.
 I used to think, with someone who could know my secrets and also douse the fire in me and thereby keep me from all the nonsense men do on account of women, I could live content and free.
 I won’t argue the chicken and egg question, does our desire for intimacy rise out of our need for God, or is our belief in God the desperate attempt to satisfy that inborn desire for intimacy.
 But I’m placing my bets on the former, the need for God answer.
 Which is why, on this road trip, I find myself hopeful to the point of desperation that, taking a cue from Brother Lawrence, I can learn to adore God enough so that he will become my daily companion, whom I count on and trust with my failings and secrets.
 Suddenly, maybe invited by all the remembering, a whole other wave of thought takes hold of me.
 I find myself muttering a line a line from Kerouac, maybe from Dharma Bums.
 “If we knew time, we would know everything.” While contemplating that idea, I begin to suspect that in some real though unfathomable way I’m not only here and now, driving alongside the silvery ocean, in Pismo Beach, June 2010.
 I’m also with my last best friend Olga, a few years ago, talking about poetry in a Greek Café.

Karen had pink, full lips and plenty of curves, and lively unhaunted eyes.
 She read books for fun and spoke softly, humbly, and acted just as nice to the lowly as to teachers or big shots.
 Besides, I had lately spent a day and evening, first at school, then at a community dance, and afterward at the Burger Hut, asking people whether they often felt guilty about something but had no idea what it was.
 I asked thirty or forty kids.
 Only one said no.
 Karen.
 Since then, I had spent many hours dreaming that she and I could run off to live in some woodland cottage.
 Maybe near a golf course, since the smashing of golf balls had become my best means of fighting the grief over losing my dad.
 Eric patted my head, which riled me.
 We finished the bourbon, then he offered to show me a wrestling hold he had recently learned.

I assume you'll need a ride home today?"
 It was the first time Isaac had actually spoken to me, and I was surprised at how well-spoken he was.
 His voice sounded like a superbly-tuned cello.
 I filed the information away as further evidence he wasn't really our age.
 "Yes please, Brandon can only take me home on Tuesdays and Thursdays."
 It wasn't my imagination; Isaac flinched slightly, and Rachel's smile momentarily turned plastic.
 I mentally kicked myself for having once again stepped squarely between the Capulets and Montagues.
 Isaac recovered with admirable speed, smiling as he gestured us forward.
 "Well, then, after you."
 It wasn't until Rachel and Isaac were driving away that I realized she'd completely pulled me out of my funk.

‘In the end everything will be true of everybody.’  And, man, I thought, yeah, that’s salvation, that’s true.
 I tried to capture that in the song.
 I probably missed the mark—you had to be there (laughs)—but I tried, you know?
 I wanted to say something about being an artist, a struggling artist, how it’s hard to even say what you mean, half the time.
 I don’t know.
 Some of that is in that song.
 The line about the maple tree is McClure’s.
 I don’t really like the arrangement we came up with for this song.
 I don’t think the backup guys were up to it.
 I should have played everything—I almost went back in and re-cut it, but, hell, it’s ok the way it is.

“The men are ready, milord,” Sergan said.
 “Do we march?”
 Antonil stared at the small town, seeing very little motion within.
 No people wandered the streets.
 No traveling merchants hawked their wares.
 He sighed and turned to Sergan, his trusted advisor in war.
 The man was old, scarred, and had dirty hair falling down to his shoulders.
 He had seen many wars, and the axe against his shoulder had claimed more than a few lives.
 “Yes, let us end this, one way or the other,” Antonil said.
 “Order them to march.

The reoccurring thought of how horrified my Dad would've been that his daughter, 'the smart one,' was going to flunk out of high school was enough to keep me constantly on the edge of a panic attack.
 The longer that went on the less ability, and even more dangerous, the less desire I'd have to try and fight it off.
 I finally opened up the note more out of a need for a distraction than any real inclination to find out what it contained.
 Adriana.
 I'm afraid I've been called into a surprise meeting with the school administration.
 Normally I wouldn't cancel the tutoring session, but Albert and Peter are both out, and it wouldn't be fair to leave you all by yourself to try and take care of everyone.
 Go ahead and tell everyone the tutoring session is canceled, and I'll see you tomorrow.
 --Nora Campbell I sat motionless for several seconds before realizing this was the out I needed.
 If I could pull myself together enough to cancel the lab, I could go home and self-destruct without ruining the scattered shards left of my life.
 "The lab has been canceled for today.

I already knew I wasn't hungry; the only real decision was how much of Mom's wrath I was willing to face later on.
 It wasn't until I had my hand on the doorknob that I remembered Brandon's promise to pick me up.
 I was so tired I actually considered for a second that he might have been serious.
 Sitting in his car, fighting not to look at his smiling gray eyes, it'd all seemed so reasonable.
 I'd lost my ride and he was grateful I'd saved him from having to interfere with Cassie, so he was going to become my personal chauffeur for the rest of the year.
 Looking at my empty lane, the school bus only minutes away, it seemed more likely Brandon wouldn't even remember talking to me.
 Just like every hot boy with every loser since the dawn of time.
 The thought hurt a little, but I'd had plenty of years to come to understand boys like that didn't go after girls like me.
 Instead of dwelling on it, greenhouse gases or anything else I couldn't change, I simply shrugged my backpack a little higher and started down the lane.
 Some kind of bird was merrily announcing to the world that he was ridiculously happy the sun was just rising, and that it was already pushing eighty degrees with the promise of something much, much worse before lunch.

Rodregas’ heart froze as the sorcerer stood and strode over to the table.
 He reached out and casually touched the shoulder of the Knight Captain.
 “Captain Intreg, do you mind asking a few questions to confirm his status?” The Knight seemed uncomfortable under the hand of the sorcerer but nodded and said to Rodregas, “What is the eighth law of Chivalry?” “Thou shalt never offer combat to someone who is not equal in strength, unless in defense of the honor of the Order, for Justice for the oppressed or in defense of the weak,” he answered.
 Captain Intreg nodded and then asked, “A question of law: two messenger couriers stop at a keep with priority messages and switch out horses.
 The local lord finds that both horses are lame and are no longer any good.
 One of the messengers is from a neighboring lord and one from the Guild of the Celestial Path.
 What rights does the lord have in this situation?” Rodregas noticed the sorcerer seemed to stiffen at the question.
 Rodregas’ mind swirled.
 The first questions had been easy, but it had been a very long time since he had studied law.
 The sorcerer’s body language, though, directed his memory to the answer.

I had put Thomas in a similar category as my biological Father, Richard.
 I considered that in both of their cases, nothing good seemed to happen when I associated with them so I just kept them out of my life and my family’s as well.
 The latest stories I had heard about Thomas were that while at one point he had escalated his abuse to injecting heroin, he then attended a drug rehab center called Narconon, which had apparently enabled him to be clean for the last couple of years.
 If this was true, and he was clean, maybe he’d be a good person to go to for help?
 My mother thought so, and she insisted that we reach out to him.
 We were obviously reluctant and for good reason, but we were also desperate.
 My mother insisted that Thomas’s last rehab stint at Narconon had worked for Thomas and she knew he had strong ties there and perhaps he could get Brandon in for treatment.
 She told us that Thomas was doing work for the rehab in the form of interventions and getting drug addicts into treatment and that was what Brandon needed.
 But at what price?
 I wasn’t as worried about the financial price at this point, but rather the thought of owing Thomas after all that he had perpetrated against us was almost as unpalatable as Brandon’s Oxy addiction.

He'd never know what had happened to her.
 Maybe, eventually, not knowing-- Rick staggered, everything suddenly going black.
 Gasping, he gripped the edge of the desk and then turned to jerk the drawer open again and grab the papers.
 Nothing had changed.
 Nothing had changed.
 He threw the papers onto the desk and ran downstairs and out into the garden.
 Forcing himself to calm down, he closed his eyes and began to think about 1927.
 He imagined Marie in the dress she'd worn to and from 1927, imagined her in a speakeasy, imagined her listening to the radio in a room without a TV.
 He had a hard time concentrating and remaining calm, but he continued to conjure up the images, trying to fill in details .

And even though he was my watcher, my captor, I had to admit I felt less alone with Chevelle there.
 Steed pulled his own ration from the spit and sat on my other side as we all watched the surface of the lake.
 And beyond it, mountains.
 The mountains at dawn were so much more intimidating and I was hesitant to leave our camp.
 Everything had begun to seem real.
 I tried to distract myself as we rode east around the lake, attempting to name the species of plants as Junnie might have made me, but there were so many I had never seen that it started to remind me of the difference rather than distract me from it.
 So I bantered with Steed regarding horses and imps and everything I could come up with to keep him talking.
 Chevelle rode quietly behind us, scanning our surroundings.
 I wasn’t sure if he was enjoying the scenery or playing lookout.
 We rode a few days into the base of the mountains.

 If there'd been any justice in the universe, he'd have somehow gotten uglier over the last few hours.
 That or I'd have developed some kind of partial immunity to him.
 Neither was the case, he was just as unearthly gorgeous as he'd been in the hall.
 The sight of him was almost overwhelming.
 As he slipped into a desk an aisle away from me, I tried to breathe deeply and slowly in a futile effort to calm my racing heart.
 It helped a little when he slid the desk back a few feet.
 As long as I watched Mrs. Alexander I couldn't see Alec anymore.
 It seemed like I could still feel him though.
 The right side of my body hummed and tingled, almost imperceptibly, telling me he was there.

“Why now, why do you have to ask?”
 “Answer me, brother.
 Now.”
 “No.
 I don’t love her.
 Is that what you want to hear?”
 The other half-orc tightened the grip on his whip.
 “Forget what I want.
 If you do not love her, then kill her.
 Now get your head beyond her and focus on the task at hand.

“Indeed, Harruq.
 It is time for action.
 I am done with both of you.
 Go home and rest.
 Tomorrow we will begin my plan.
 War shall come to Woodhaven.”
 “We await your orders,” Qurrah said.
 The two bowed and then returned to town beneath the blanket of stars.

"He's not my boyfriend, Mom.
 I mean he wasn't really ever my boyfriend, but even less so now."
 Mom looked away from the skyline, a new batch of concern painted across her features.
 "I'm so sorry, dear.
 I didn't particularly approve of him, but I wasn't going to get really vocal about it.
 Not when he was your first boyfriend.
 What happened?"
 I didn't have to pretend to be hurt and disappointed.
 Even knowing that Alec was everything I'd thought Brandon was, I still felt used and disappointed.
 "I just wasn't what he was looking for.

"Mother says it represents my birth.
 She was always an excellent performer.
 Donovan says she would've been nationally acclaimed if she'd chosen to pursue a career instead of marrying my father.
 She didn't begin composing until after he was gone."
 In what was for me a rare display of common sense over curiosity, I shelved the rest of my questions and looked for something I could use to help him sidestep the memories.
 "Growing up surrounded by this, and neither you or Rachel play an instrument?"
 Alec shook his head.
 "I've never had the finesse to play anything.
 Rachel took violin lessons for more than a year.
 I think she wanted to be able to play with mother.

8.Launch a massive programme to impart new skills and attitudes to the population: In countries where private enterprise was extinguished for decades, entrepreneurial, financial and marketing skills can be extremely limited.
 An analysis should be undertaken of the types and levels of skills needed for transition to a market system, covering areas such as entrepreneurship, management, national and international marketing, strategic business planning, finance, quality control, product development, production technology, design, and human resource development.
 Experience in former colonial nations where entrepreneur ship was also stifled for a long period indicates that a profound change in attitude is necessary before people will risk leaving or forego seeking salaried and pensioned jobs in favour of self-employment, even when the salaried jobs are scarce or unavailable.
 Such a basic change of attitude, which normally requires a change of generation, can be accelerated by a massive programme of public information, education and demonstration spanning several years.
 9.Study the benefits of economic recovery on world trade: Recessionary trends are affecting many parts of the world today.
 The prognosis in the West, especially in the European Union, is for slow growth during the 1990s.
 The progress of developing countries is impeded by slow growth in the industrialized nations and the collapse of Eastern Europe.
 What would be the impact on the world economy of a rapid recovery and economic expansion in the countries of the region?
 What would be the result elsewhere of further decline in Eastern Europe?
 These questions are of vital relevance to the entire world.

Rather than searching for a victor and vanquished, the urgent need is to find a successor that combines and synthesizes the enlightened values of both systems – freedom and equality, liberty and security.
 It has been amply proved that the authoritarian state is incapable of exerting a benevolent authority over the people without imposing severe restrictions on freedom, stifling human energy and creativity, leading sooner or later to rising discontent and a loss of social vitality.
 It is also abundantly clear that money as an institution operating through the free pricing mechanism of the market system – although it does succeed in generating high levels of energy, creativity and productivity – regards people as a purchasable commodity or a potential market, but is otherwise indifferent to human values and welfare.
 Neither the determinism of the state nor the determinism of the market can be adequate in themselves to achieve the goals of peace and prosperity that we strive after.
 It has been generally assumed that the transition now taking place in Eastern Europe will sooner or later lead these countries to adopt forms of government and economy identical to those prevalent in the West.
 But for those raised in a society that offered a great measure of social security, the poverty and insecurity of the Western system are gross inadequacies.
 While it is clear that these new democracies have rejected the authoritarian statist system, it is not yet clear what finally they will accept, discover or invent as a more acceptable alternative.
 The creativity and inventiveness they have exhibited in seeking an alternative in the past may quite possibly lead them to discover that better social system which both East and West are in need of.
 Viewed from an evolutionary perspective, we may surmise the general direction and likely destination of that quest.
 The requirements of the state and the market must eventually give way to the needs of people.

For the first time all day I felt like I could relax.
 The few times I looked up, I saw Britney, who seemed determined not to give in and actually do her homework.
 I finished my two assignments about the time I normally did, and walked over to where Mrs. Campbell was trying to explain a story problem.
 The sophomore she was helping looked like he wanted to be anywhere other than trying to figure out how long it would take Sally to mow the lawn given a certain width of lawn mower moving at a given rate of speed.
 "Oh, Adriana.
 Go ahead and walk around looking for students who need help.
 Most everyone will leave in the next ten minutes or so, but we're actually open for another hour."
 She was right.
 Nearly everyone left over the next little while as they either finished up their assignments, gave up, or finally filled whatever quota of study time they'd been given by their parents.
 I did get to answer a couple of questions, which was surprisingly fun.

At my touch, the thistle leaves crumbled.
 There were some seeds and bulbs lying where the ashes fell, and I recognized the scene.
 It was the thistle I had grown.
 The garden.
 I rushed out, leaving the door open as I had found it.
 I hurried from the village, trying to remember where the abandoned garden was located, almost running under the clouding skies.
 It wasn’t hard to find because of its new size, but if I hadn’t been half expecting, half fearing the excessive growth, I might not have recognized it.
 Each of the strains I had grown the day Evelyn choked was flourishing.
 Noxious weeds were taking over the meadow.
 As I stood there, frozen before this changed garden, I was overwhelmed by the scene, overtaken by emotion, and had to press my eyes closed.

If you are a father or a mother now, there was a day when you were a son or a daughter.
 Perhaps one day you will become a grandparent.
 During all of these periods your experiences and certain moments mold you into who you will be.
 It isn’t easy to forget the dark places in your past but you can either learn from them and become a better person or repeat the same behavior and have it slowly destroy you.
 I make many mistakes as a father, but I have always tried the best I know how.
 Sometimes no matter what a person does as a parent, children may travel to dangerous places.
 Some will return from those places unharmed and some may never return.
 A family can look perfect from the outside but be quite the opposite on the inside.
 I have lived such a life.
 I do not know what made me do what I did for my son but I can only surmise that it was a combination of all of the defining moments in my life that lead me to where I am today.

Let us fight it when it comes, but not sooner, not now, not while they sleep…”
 He looked away as if expecting to be berated for the outburst.
 Instead, Qurrah walked over and put a hand on his brother’s shoulder.
 “Be careful,” he said in his raspy voice.
 “Your power was given at a cost.
 Any hesitation or doubt risks the permanency of your gift.
 I understand, please know that.
 In time, you will learn, and you will see things as I do.
 Until then, rest.

ICPF strongly favours a movement towards the liberalization of world trade in agricultural products because it can be of immense benefit to job creation, industrialization, and economic growth in developing countries, and thereby act as a driving force for growth and employment generation in the industrial world as well.
 The liberalization of domestic policies for this sector is also needed in developing countries where government controls and populist policies have often retarded growth of agriculture.
 However, the timing and extent of these measures should be dictated by the relative strengths and needs of each particular country, not by strict adherence to any economic doctrine.
 Role of Government
 Agricultural subsidies and protection are subsets of a larger issue – the role of government in agricultural development.
 The experience of the past four decades strongly supports the view that government can play a vital role in stimulating agriculture up to the stage where the rural economy demonstrates the dynamism needed to take off on its own.
 Although the Green Revolution has been widely heralded as an achievement of modern technology, the hybrid seeds and chemical-based cultivation practices that formed the technological basis for the breakthrough in foodgrain production constitute only one part of a comprehensive, integrated development strategy in which government played a central and crucial role.
 This strategy included massive, country-wide demonstration programmes to introduce farmers to new technology, the establishment of new public sector agencies for rapid multiplication and distribution of seeds, assured markets and guaranteed floor prices for foodgrains to eliminate fear that higher production would result in crashing prices, construction of additional storage capacity to house the increased production, import or manufacture of fertilizers, and, most importantly, for transport, distribution and marketing of surplus grains in food deficit areas.
 Few developing countries – perhaps few countries at any stage of development – could have marshalled resources on such a massive scale and instituted such widespread changes so rapidly without heavy reliance on the government for both planning and execution.
 In the majority of developing countries, government is still the most organized and efficient agency and the only one capable of such significant initiative.

My heart stuttered and threatened to quit as his lips slowly came down to meet mine.
 My only other experience had been so terrible that I nearly panicked, but before I could formulate a protest, or even decide if a protest was what I wanted, our flesh touched.
 The contact immediately drove every other thought from my mind.
 His lips were the perfect combination of firm and soft, and the heart that'd been all but stopped a second before sped up to heart attack rates, slamming itself against my chest in an effort to get closer to him.
 All of my senses were blending together.
 I couldn't tell if he smelled incredible, tasted like heaven, or if it was all just a side effect of the energy which had gone from tingling to crackling as soon as our faces touched.
 My inhibitions, the ones that'd always kept me from acting on the occasional amorous impulse, evaporated sometime in the first half second, and I found myself with both arms wrapped around his neck, clinging to him with all my strength.
 Later I'd probably claim it was to steady myself against the wave of dizziness, but right now I knew it was because I wanted him more than anything I'd ever experienced.
 Alec pulled me away, held me at arm's length while I gasped for air, and then once I calmed down a little, he smiled and pulled me in close again, just for a hug this time.
 I tried to turn it into a kiss, but he deftly avoided my attempt, burying his face in my hair.

Imeralda nodded, “Sure, there are four sources of magic: mortal, Celestial, Infernal and elemental.
 It is one of the reasons I am prized for my potential with more than one power.
 My AElven ancestry is strong with mortal magic, but my Nymph side is strong in elemental magic.
 If an Immortalist takes my power, he or she could become stronger in both.” “Mostly correct,” Jordaan said.
 “It is actually a topic of much debate among magicians.
 I go along with the belief that there is no such thing as ‘mortal’ magic.
 While we don’t have time now to go over all the proof, the general thought is that mortals are truly just animals and don’t produce magic.
 It is only our connection to other realms that provides us power.
 Mana is the raw energy of magic no matter what its source.
 You can use mana from any source to cast spells.” He looked around at the three of them to make sure they understood.

Contrary to free market theory, farmers in many countries have tended to continue production of traditional crops, even when prices have fallen in response to increased supplies.
 There is still a need for government to educate and encourage farmers to adopt resource-based planning, oriented to national and international market potentials and based on principles of economics, employment and ecology.
 Resource-based planning examines how the available land and water resources can best be utilized to achieve maximum and sustainable economic return to the farmer, which is only rarely the priority of governments in developing countries that tend to focus on production targets for specific commodities.
 This shift can lead to diversification into commercial crops, such as fruit and vegetables, that generate significant increases in on-farm employment and incomes and act as a stimulus to downstream agro-industries.
 From minimum needs to maximum potentials
 The factors which have perpetuated commodity-based planning in agriculture have also fostered an emphasis on minimum targets, rather than maximum goals.
 Often government has perceived that its responsibility was to ensure sufficient food to prevent famine, not maximum output and profitability.
 Government machinery has proved effective in forcing through radical measures to disseminate new technology, seed and production methods in the face of crisis, but it usually lacks the driving impetus to work for the highest benefit of individual farmers.
 The shift needed is for planners to study the potentials of the agricultural sector to serve as an engine for job creation and higher incomes, and as a stimulus to industrialization and exports, and then to formulate national goals to maximize exploitation of these potentials.

The latter have proliferated in recent decades and affected almost half of OECD imports during the 1980s.
 By the end of 1990, there were more than 200 export-constraint arrangements involving product groups of impor tance to developing countries.
 The incidence of anti-dumping cases against developing countries rose substantially in the late 1980s.
 The more recent effort by the industrial nations to impose 'fair labour standards' on exports from developing countries could well become another form of constraint, unless carefully formulated to focus on the basic rights of workers, rather than on arbitrary minimum wage levels.
 Efforts to accelerate the dismantling of both trade and non-trade barriers should be viewed as a central element of a global strategy to stimulate employment generation.
 6.Debt repayments: The debt problem is a major obstacle to the development and welfare of at least 60 heavily indebted, developing countries, including two-thirds of the world's poorest nations.
 Most of these countries suffered a decline in per capita income over the past decade and are now in arrears with more than 20 per cent of their debt obligations.
 The debt burden discourages new foreign investment and lending to these coun tries and prevents them from stimulating economic growth through additional domestic savings and investment.
 International debt relief has helped ten, mostly middle-income, debtor countries significantly reduce their commercial debt.
 Past actions to relieve the debt burden on low-income countries have been relatively small in relation to the amount of debt, which has continued to rise under the combined impact of accumulated interest arrears on old loans, falling export commodity prices, and new compensatory loans, frequently given on expensive terms.

“They are traveling with a patrol of Immortal guards.
 I think there are only four, but scout patrols often have a warrior with a minor sigil of enhanced senses.
 He might spot us.” As she spoke Rodregas noticed that Imeralda had a strange expression on her face, she was scared, but also seemed sad.
 “What kind of slaves do they have?” Rodregas asked in a gentle voice.
 Her body jerked more directly toward him, surprise covering her sad expression for a second.
 “Mixed, of course, human, AElfin.
 But, Rodregas, they have Forest and Earth Nymphs and several are children.
 I was raised among AElfin, but these are my people.
 I wish we could do something.“ Rodregas nodded his understanding and said, “I wish we could, but the three of us against a score, the chances of our success is far smaller than the chances of our death.” He stated in the ‘matter of fact’ sergeant voice that he knew people would follow.
 Rodregas stood up and started to turn, but while Doi’van stood he faced the road and he said, “I have been on this road before, though I did not know then that it was called ‘The Princess Road.’ To me it was a road of sorrow.” Doi’van was using that flat voice that he used when stating facts.

He mumbled something under his breath.
 “I can’t hear you.” Emily snapped.
 “I WAS OUT SCOUTING!” he shouted, “Now can you hear me?” “Yes, and now you’ve made me deaf!” Emily yelled back.
 “Why were you out scouting in the first place?” I asked calmly, trying not to shout it out like Emily.
 Seth gripped the handlebars and I knew he was losing his temper.
 “I was being cautious so we didn’t have to worry last night,” He said through gritted teeth.
 He was lying and both of us knew that.
 I glared at him, “Nice story Seth, now what really happened?” He didn’t say anything and he rode ahead to get beside Jason, who was in the lead.
 The park slowly came in view.
 It was a huge grass circle with a small play set in the middle covered in kids.

“Well,” Doi’van replied slowly, “the cats are obviously connected to him due to his Celestial lion essence.
 He freed them and now he has found a rich place for them to rear their young if they are pregnant from the mating.
 But with beasts like that, you are either in charge or you are game.
 I think that he probably did the right thing.
 No way to know for sure, but they did not rip him apart, so we will say he was very brave and not very stupid.” Then he added, “Of course, if you had asked me before hand, I would have said that taking food from a Dire Cat was a very stupid idea.” He finished with a smile full of sharp teeth almost a match for the lions and in a casual movement lowered his horned head in what Rodregas thought might be his equivalent of a shrug.
 The next morning they repeated the Morning Prayer and meditation ritual.
 This time while Doi’van joined in, Imeralda mostly watched.
 Afterwards Rodregas said to both, “I have been thinking that we are probably going to be here a few weeks while I finish healing up from the knife wound.
 I want to make the most of the time.” Doi’van said, “I have a feeling that you have some sort of training in mind.” Rodregas nodded and said, “I have developed some bad habits the last few years; I know my technique is rusty and now my timing is all off with my new body.
 I am not sure what your training backgrounds are, though.” He said, waving at Imeralda, who often of late was holding her Black Yew bow close with an intimacy that spoke more of a caress than holding a weapon, “Clearly, Imeralda likes the bow.” Rodregas continued, “Even though Imeralda plans to stay out of the middle of things, learning some basic hand-to-hand and sword fighting is a good idea.

But this figure is of questionable significance.
 The gross debt includes the debt held by government departments and public agencies as well as by private institutions and individuals.
 When the government-held portion is deducted, the actual net debt of these countries is approximately half the gross debt, which means the net interest burden for servicing the debt is also only half.
 Furthermore, it is not clear that a comparison of debt to GDP is a very meaningful index.
 Debt is a cumulative measure of stock, while GDP is an annual measure of flow.
 When the total debt of OECD countries is compared to the total capital stock of these countries, the debt is equal to a relatively modest 15 per cent of the current capital stock of these nations.
 In contrast to the recommendations made by the OECD, the Delors Plan for stimulating employment in Western Europe, which was recently rejected by member countries of the European Community, called for a large increase in public investment in expensive communication and transportation infra structure projects as a means of creating more jobs in the near term and increasing the competitive ness of European economies by improving their infra structure.
 Instead of investing in ambitious, high-tech projects whose future impact on job creation is unclear, the industrial nations should make sub stantial increases in public investment to improve the tools of the work force by lending to promote small enterprises together with increased public investment in education and training, which will stimulate short-, medium- and long-term job growth.
 The recommendations set forth in this report are based on the conviction that nothing less than a legal commitment of the society to guarantee employment is justified and nothing less will be sufficient to solve the problem.
 Only then can the requisite political will be generated to push through effective measures.

In parallel to a UN Earth corps, national Earth corps units should be constituted to operate within each state and for service internationally under the UN.
 Vocational skills imparted through these agencies will be of subsequent use to the community at large.
 5.A greater degree of cooperation in the sharing of environmental data is essential if global security is to be enhanced, particularly that gained from military remote-sensing devices.
 This is especially relevant to the majority of nations which do not have such equipment at their disposal.
 The need for secrecy, always stressed in the Cold War period, has been superseded by the need for openness.
 6.An international system should be instituted by the UN to assist in the transfer of environmentally beneficial technology, as recommended by the Royal Society and the United States National Academy of Sciences, both from the developed to the less-developed nations, and from the military to the non-military sectors.
 This applies in particular to the field of information technology, where there is scope for dual use of existing military capabilities.
 Closer links should be established between research and development teams in the military and civilian sectors at the national level.
 7.A greater degree of regional cooperation is desirable between states which share natural resources and common environmental interests.
 This is of particular importance where regional peace and stability is at stake, as in the Middle East, over the question of access to water supplies.

If I could put a caption over her head, it would have read, “If you talk to me, I will kill you.” She looked completely out of place, and her blue eyes lit up the room.
 Her silent stare suggested that she was not there to be picked up or even approached.
 She was not the typical girl entering an 80’s bar and dance club.
 My mouth must have dropped open as I watched her every move; she appeared to be looking for someone in particular.
 I looked at my friend Bill and I swear I said to him: “I am going to marry that girl!” We hadn’t been there long, and I wasn’t drunk or impaired in any way, I just remember she seemed to be literally glowing, and I knew.
 I had never felt this before and I have never felt it since.
 Bill jokingly picked up a coin from the change on the bar and said “I’ll flip you for her” to which I replied, “Flip all you want, that is going to be my wife!” Bill flipped the coin anyway and I called “tails,” and tails it was.
 I had no choice but to muster the courage to talk to her.
 Her reception was cool.
 Her name was Lisa and she was there to meet her friend who happened to be dating the bartender (who I knew well) so that was a good angle for me to work.

Qurrah closed his eyes and inhaled the cold night air.
 Yes, the tension was delectable.
 The quiet moments before battle were a rare thing that so very few were lucky enough to experience.
 Fear, worry, hope, prayer, regret, and sorrow all floated to the stars.
 The half-orc let his attuned mind drink it all in.

My head didn’t throb as before, no sour mouth.
 It was overall a much better experience.
 But who could stand the dreams?
 I rolled to my side, rubbing the sleep from my face.
 There were a few books on the bedside table and I reached over to draw the top one near.
 I flipped idly through the pages, until I recognized it was detailing the different aspects of magic.
 I hurriedly scanned through, getting caught on a section marked Exchange.
 It claimed using magic consumed a person’s energy.
 Not just immediately available energy, but life energy.
 I’d never known a book to lie, but I couldn’t imagine its applications otherwise.

The three stood in the center of the town, corpses scattered in all directions.
 There was an eerie silence creeping about, its soft touch tickling Harruq’s spine.
 He held the hilts of his twin blades in his hands, drawing comfort from them.
 At that dark moment, it was his only comfort.
 “You know what I ask of you,” Velixar said.
 “I do,” Qurrah said.
 “I pray I do not disappoint.”
 He closed his eyes, his hands stretched to either side.
 His fingers hooked and curled in strange ways, many times so twisted and odd that Harruq could not bear to watch them dance.
 Words spilled from the frail half-orc’s lips.

“Where do we go?” he asked, his voice revealing his defeat.
 “We’ll figure it out in the morning.
 For now, we travel north.
 Your brother will be fine, I promise.”
 He nodded but said nothing.
 The two traveled in between the hills, exhausted but unwilling to stop their movement.
 “Why did you fight the elves?” she asked when their silence had stretched for more than half an hour.
 “It’ll be a long story,” he said.
 “We have time.”
 He chuckled.

I jolted awake, the smell of burning flesh still lingering in my senses, and was staring at Ruby’s ceiling.
 Curse her.
 I was alone in her bed, but could hear an exchange of low whispers from the open door as she and Steed conversed in the front room.
 I wasn’t about to announce I had woken.
 My head didn’t throb as before, no sour mouth.
 It was overall a much better experience.
 But who could stand the dreams?
 I rolled to my side, rubbing the sleep from my face.
 There were a few books on the bedside table and I reached over to draw the top one near.
 I flipped idly through the pages, until I recognized it was detailing the different aspects of magic.

I can hear him speak thoughtful words.
 Fear v. Love
 While speeding on Interstate 5 north out of Sacramento past orchards and pastures, with long miles between the small towns, I think back to my talk with Toni, the part about suffering from panic attacks.
 During five of those hard years, while I taught in Chico, I often drove this highway to visit writer friends in San Francisco.
 This part of I-5 terrified me, with visions of a sudden attack that would deny me control over my mind or body, leaving me helpless and miles from the closest nurse or doctor.
 For no good reason except the fear of fear, my heart would race, my lungs and throat constrict, my hands become slick with sweat.
 I couldn’t run because I couldn’t breathe.
 I couldn't fight, because the enemy was me.
 The first time, a few years before, I landed at County Mental Health in San Diego.
 A doctor prescribed valium, which barely helped.

Laughing again, Marie twirled in the spray.
 "This is fun!"
 Rick shook his head, grinning.
 "What am I going to do with you?"
 Dropping the hose, he went to hug her.
 "You're absolutely incorrigible."
 "Who, me?"
 She leaned back to smile up at him.
 "Is it my fault you have all these wonderful toys?"
 He smiled, removing a wet strand of hair from her face.

The attack was a bad one.
 I lost more time.
 I must have slept at some point, but the next time I surfaced it was Saturday morning and I was sitting in front of an empty bowl with an unopened box of cereal and a gallon of milk waiting in the wings.
 At some point I realized I wasn't hungry.
 I put everything back away and went upstairs for a shower.
 It didn't help.
 By the time I was done, I was clean but just as emotionally numb as before.
 At least I'd turned the water all the way to cold there at the end.
 I came out shivering, but it was a welcome change from the oppressive heat.
 Even that didn't last; it felt like I was sweating again before I even finished dressing.

Was that a smooth transition?
 Did I miss something?
 From Van Morrison to Lorelei.
 That’s a story, isn’t it, sweet?
 Um.
 It was at the Shell.
 Black Lung was playing, one of our first headlining gigs, I think.
 I came off stage after the encore, after we’d done a cooking version of “I Love my Aunt Jemima,” Skippy going wild like a man possessed, and maybe he was, man, maybe he was.
 This was Memphis, those things are real, man.
 No one looks askance at a little theurgy, you know, a little of that Memphis Mojo, that hoodoo that brought us everything from W. C. to Isaac to Booker to Big Star to Jism.

 And, as a young man, who appreciated a young woman who loved lingerie, well, we had some fiery times.
 Hot as monkeys.
 She had these little white things…I don’t know where she got ‘em.
 Let’s move onto a higher plane.

"No.
 If you're really worried about it just make sure that one of the others are in the room at the same time with you."
 "Now that has some real possibilities."
 I was still rolling the thought around in my mind when the bell rang and Alec pulled me to my feet.
 We swapped out our books and were halfway to Spanish when Vincent and Brandon strode into view.
 Moving so smoothly I was positive that nobody else even realized anything was wrong, Alec swung me around so he was between them and me.
 The tension ratcheted up in step with the rolling waves of energy, as Brandon and Vincent drew nearer.
 They split up when they saw us, casually positioning themselves so Alec couldn't protect me from both of them.
 I felt my knees stop working as I took in Brandon's lazy, confident smile, and Vincent's sick, eager expression, but the gentle pressure of Alec's grasp on my hand kept me from falling down.
 I looked up at Alec, hoping for a reassuring smile, but his face had taken on the expressionless mask he used to guard his thoughts.

I placated myself by remembering he would soon be gone, his life so short.
 I held him until the daylight began to fade, and then carried his lifeless body into the village.
 Proof they would be attacked and killed, proof they must fight the elves.
 It was not hard to incite a riot.
 They were fearful creatures.
 I convinced them to raid the castle, gave them direction.
 And then I returned.
 I knew I would have time to prepare.
 They would be slow to gather and make the journey.
 I was thinking of Noble as I resolved to wear the dress meant for our wedding, with its dramatic shape and deep meaning.

All died before they had the chance to swing their blades.
 “At last!” Felewen cried, staring out from a side alley.
 They were behind a group of ten soldiers battling a pair of elven warriors who stood back to back.
 “Make haste, they need us!”
 Felewen charged, desperate to arrive before her brethren were overwhelmed.
 Aurelia stepped into the street and summoned her magic.
 Frost surrounded her hands, and a thin sheet of ice spread beneath the human soldiers.
 Many of them stumbled, unable to balance the sword and shield in their hands and the heavy chainmail on their bodies.
 Felewen slid on one leg, her sword out and ready.
 She passed right between two men, slicing out heels and tendons as she flew by.

She wanted Rick to hold her, to caress her hair and kiss her temple and whisper that he loved her.
 But she'd never have that again.
 When she'd chosen to return home, she'd given him up forever.
 She managed to hold herself together until she was in her room.
 Then she burst into tears.

 "Would you like some more broccoli, Marie?"
 Marie shook her head.
 "No, thank you."
 "She's too excited about seeing me again."

If we are going to do that I will be of most use as a warrior.
 We have a powerful magic user,” he said with a smile.
 Imeralda smiled back at the complement and the three got back and continued their walk to the Chamber of Sigils.
 CHAPTER 16 TO RAISE A SWORD
 Rodregas was careful to walk with the confidence due of a new knight eager for his awards.
 Doi’van and Imeralda followed two steps behind, both playing the role of faithful servants to the hilt.
 He saw the double, engraved doors ahead of them, a pair of knights on each side of the door.
 The doors were large enough that the three of them could have entered abreast through the threshold and the doors were solid enough, looking as if they were made out of whole trees.
 Bound in iron, they looked like they could handle a battering ram better than even the front gates.
 A group of knights stood tall next to the doors, but their heads tracked the presence of Rodregas and his two companions.

We just won right now,” Emily said.
 “The penguins?” “Does that really matter?” she hissed.
 “You’re on.” Jason smirked, “Alright then, penguins, if you want a water war, you got one.” “You’re on too!” This whole time Seth didn’t say a word, which was strange.
 Usually Seth did all the talking while Jason stood watching but now Jason was doing all the talking and Seth was the one watching.
 He stood there and seemed unmoved from being soaked by my water gun.
 His face was blank and he was staring at nothing.
 It wasn’t the Seth I was friends with.
 While Emily and Jason were bickering I said, “Seth?” Seth didn’t answer.
 He acted like he didn’t hear me.
 “Seth?

I assume you’ve seen movies about bikers.
 Can we get on with the new name now?
 Jim – Ah yes, biker movies, I don’t think you’d have made one of them a good wife anyways.
 Guess asking you to stop wouldn’t work for me after all.
 Liz – I told you that you should start lifting weights, besides you might look cute in a leather jacket.
 Jim – I think it’s easier not to piss large men off, then they have no reason to hurt me, and I have no reason to life weights, so I don’t need large muscles.
 Unless you count the appeal to chicks.
 Besides working out would require going out in that hot weather under that big hot shiny bright thing.
 Liz – A little exercise out in the sunshine won’t hurt you.
 Jim – Maybe, maybe not, but it would cut into my video game time.

Struggling with my reactions kept me distracted from the ride.
 It was steep now, rocky, a haze hanging in the few spiky trees.
 When we stopped for the evening, the men quietly set up a perimeter.
 Except for Chevelle.
 He was watching me as I glared back at him.
 Why had I expected more from him?
 He was my watcher.
 He’d volunteered to help council bind me.
 But it didn’t stop the hostile stare I was sending his way.
 Ruby stepped in front of him.

“You disagree?” Qurrah asked, his delight vanishing into a sudden frown.
 “No,” Harruq said.
 He thought to explain and then just shrugged.
 “It makes me uneasy,” he said instead.
 “But do as you wish.”
 The frailer brother approached the end of the alley where the sound of combat was strongest.
 His steps faltered only once.
 When Harruq moved to catch him, Qurrah glared and leaned against the side of a house.
 When a luckless orc rushed too close to the exit, Qurrah hurled the orb.
 Its explosion conjured shadows and shifting mists of violets and purples.

What do you call a date?"
 "You know--going out to dinner and then dancing or to a concert or something."
 "I'd rather wash my car and have a pizza delivered."
 She frowned.
 "Why?"
 "Because we have a better chance to get to know each other."
 He took her hand, kissing the back of her fingers.
 "This week we've exercised, done laundry, shopped, gone to the beach, cooked, watched TV, and talked the whole time.
 Well, except when we were watching TV, and even then your questions helped me to get to know you."
 She laid her head on his shoulder, pleased but confused.

Eradicating the Roots of Terrorism: Terrorism is not new to the world, but with the withdrawal of national rivalries between East and West, violence by non-nation states has increased in intensity and is viewed as a far greater security concern by the entire world.
 This has spurred an unprecedented international effort to control and suppress terrorist activity.
 But there is little hope of abolishing this menace without simultaneously comprehending and addressing the root causes of terrorism in the world today.
 In a sense, the human urge for violence has neither increased nor decreased.
 It has simply shifted the field of expression from confrontation between nation states to confrontation between powerful governments and disenchanted, disenfranchised groups of individuals who respond to the application of superior power by nation states with the application of indiscriminate violence against the public-at-large.
 Terrorism thrives in the absence of effective democratic institutions to give voice to the will of its citizens.
 At the same time, lifting the tyranny of state terrorism has itself become the occasion in some instances for an outburst of violence by long suppressed groups.
 Eradication of terrorism is possible, but it demands a comprehensive and integrated approach and concerted, collective action.
 The commercialization of the arms trade – which benefits some countries economically at the expense of the security of all nations – must be subject to rigorous monitoring and control by international agencies.
 Vested economic interests that thrive on conflict must be placed under UN surveillance and regulation.

I hated the fact that I wanted Brandon to come sit down with me.
 If he did a convincing enough job pretending to like me and I tried really hard, maybe I'd believe it'd all just been my imagination.
 It'd be one less piece of my world crumbling out from under me.
 Britney slammed her tray down, but my listless gaze didn't move from the vacant corner where Brandon usually sat.
 A few minutes later a group of girls came to join us.
 I recognized them, but didn't bother putting names to the faces.
 It was like I got hit with another panic attack.
 Somehow I lost an hour, but nobody was running around calling for an ambulance so I must have at least responded to direct questions.
 Alec was sitting in his normal seat as I wandered into physics.
 I tried to remember whether or not I'd already heard the second bell ring.

Peace, democracy and development are inseparable and interdependent.
 Liberal democracy and economic opportunity for all are essential ingredients for winning the war against terrorism.
 Accepting the spiritual principle which tells us that there is an element of truth even in the most outrageous or misinformed viewpoint, we must not only vehemently condemn but also sincerely recognize the unaddressed issues that underpin the urge for violence.
 In this sense, terrorists crudely expose the mental insincerity prevalent in international politics.
 Those who wield national power must come to realize that force of compulsion will not bring about a permanent reconciliation and amelioration of relationships in human affairs.
 Superior power must bring with it a superior sense of fairness and a commitment to constructive dialogue and action to attack the root causes of terrorism.
 It must shed its own accretion of mental insincerity cloaked as diplomacy.
 Then and then only these movements of violence will shrink and finally disappear.
 The period following September 11th, as US National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice put it, is one “not just of grave danger, but of enormous opportunity.”
 Resolving Local Conflicts: The Commission concluded that the end of the Cold War made it possible to successfully resolve problems that had resisted solution for decades, such as the many violent communal and ethnic conflicts occurring in the world.

I traded tickets with Suzanne Bergerman, so we get to sit together!"
 Life couldn't get any better.
 I was going to Les Misérables with Rachel, and I only had two more hours before Brandon would be taking me home.
 Chapter 16 My time with Brandon blurred by too quickly.
 It was like the time between when he picked me up and dropped me off didn't even exist.
 One moment I'd be blah and mundane, then next I'd be with him and the world was perfect.
 When I was by myself, it was hard to believe it all hadn't been a dream.
 Thursday morning flew by, it was like I blinked and it was already time for Mrs. Campbell's class.
 A number of the other girls, and even a couple of the guys, stopped by my desk before the bell rang to congratulate me on winning the last ticket to Les Misérables.
 Britney wasn't one of them.

And I don’t know why, but I really don’t want to go in.” Doi’van and Rodregas shared another look and then nodding, stepped out of the chamber.
 The three of them stood silent for a minute.
 Finally, Doi’van spoke, “Maybe you need a connection to see the doors and the room?
 All of us worship the Celestials and we were all drawn to their sigils, especially Rodregas.
 I was drawn to the door here, which makes sense.
 This room, like the Celestial Chamber, seems to have similar beasts of the Infernal realm.
 Rodregas was also drawn to a lesser extent, which might indicate that we were right about Ravenhurr experimenting with Infernal power.
 If Ravenhurr had already included its magic in his own, then Rodregas would have it now.
 Imeralda though has no connection to the Infernal Realms and therefore is blind to it.” The three nodded slowly, caught up in the mystery of the hidden chambers.
 Imeralda said, “The need for a connection to sense the rooms would be true for the knights as well.

My ears had stopped ringing the moment he’d hit the ground.
 Ruby relaxed and stepped away from me.
 I wanted to catch up with what had happened but no one was talking, the mountain was silent.
 Rhys and Rider were once again gone from sight.
 “Aren’t you going to perform the death ceremony?” I worried as the other elves began walking away.
 Anvil spat on the mangled body.
 The corpse.
 “It’s done.” I stood staring at the crumpled mass as the others gathered, arguing.
 A council member.
 “It’s time to move,” someone said.

The men were thicker.
 Not necessarily with muscle, some more bulbous.
 The women were varied as well, some thin and wiry, some stout like the males.
 Their hair was in all shades—light blond like the sun, brown as the trees, one even had rusty red, his plump cheeks peppered with light brown spots.
 And there were so many children!
 They were loud and ran round the camp all afternoon.
 And they were just as varied as the adults.
 I examined their wide noses, rounded ears, and stubby fingers.
 Those who wore no shoes had short, thick toes like trolls.
 The men had patches of hair curled on their chests and forearms and some even grew it around their chins like goats.

"Whether that was his intent or not, the Sun didn't completely abandon him, either out of respect for what they'd shared, or possibly out of concern for her children.
 Once it became apparent that the Earth and Sun were through with each other, the Moon began to court her.
 Doomed to touch only briefly during the rare solar eclipses, they nevertheless became beloved, one to the other.
 The greatest sign of the Moon's devotion to the Sun came about when he sent his children down to the Earth to watch over and protect the sunborn, or dayborn as they are most often called."
 Alec's pause was long enough that I think I nodded off, but the sound of his voice once he resumed talking pulled me back awake.
 "Originally there were just two of the moonborn, a pair of brothers called Adjam and Inock.
 Unbeknown to the Moon, the Earth had anticipated his great gesture of love, and sent forth a plague upon the land.
 As Adjam, the elder of the brothers, descended from the heavens and touched down upon the Earth, he collapsed to the ground in pain.
 Despite his agony as the very bones of his body rearranged themselves, he managed to call out a warning to Inock, to flee back to the Moon.
 The love of Inock for Adjam was so great that he rushed to his brother's side, where he too fell victim to the Earth's plague."

Rapid expansion of education, training and public health, especially rural health and education, can also serve as a conscious strategy for employment generation.
 Technology of organization
 Much emphasis is placed on the widening gap in technology between North and South, but the gap in the technology of organization is even greater.
 Creation of new types of systems and organizations can create markets and jobs in many ways.
 The Dutch system of flower auction co-operatives is so successful that 68 per cent of the entire world’s exports of cut flowers pass through markets in the Netherlands.
 The franchise system has led to a rapid proliferation of new businesses and new jobs in the West in such widely diverse fields as food services, home remodelling, dry cleaning and real estate.
 Industrial estates, export processing zones, export promotion councils, export insurance, warehouse receipts, quality standards, and thousands of other organizational innovations have been either created or borrowed by developing countries to accelerate social progress.
 A comprehensive study of successful systems and institutions that can be transferred and adapted to local conditions will document the enormous untapped potential for stimulating faster economic and job growth by inventing, imitating and further improving social systems.
 Action Plan to Stimulate Employment in Developing Countries
 Employment generation is a product of multiple factors that combine together.

 Tears shimmered in her eyes.
 "I was miserable.
 I mean, I was really happy to see my family, and we felt closer than ever.

It was time to test the spells his master had taught him.
 An elderly man came around the corner, a torch his only weapon.
 He glared at Qurrah with unabashed hatred.
 “ _Weakness_ ,” the necromancer hissed in the wispy tongue of magic.
 The old man dropped his torch and wobbled on his legs.
 His elderly arms, already shriveled, shrunk even more.
 Skin tightened against his frame, and in seconds it was if the man had become a living skeleton decorated with flesh, hair, and clothes.
 The man took a staggered step forward, still determined to fight Qurrah even as his arms struggled to bear their own weight.
 He let out a moan of unintelligible loathing.
 “You are not worth my time,” Qurrah told him.

She worked as a carhop at a Bob’s Big Boy hamburger joint and she wore roller skates to serve the drive up customers in their cars.
 My Uncle Dan would take us there at night to visit her and she could sometimes sneak us some food.
 We would watch her roller-skating from car to car and back inside to retrieve her food orders.
 Uncle Dan was a hero to us as he was the only consistent male figure in our life.
 The drive up stations at Bob’s Big Boy were filled with a variety of Hot Rods and they were in all shapes, colors and sizes.
 The engines revved and the tires squealed consistently as the parade of cars cruised through.
 It was an exciting place and a formative moment for both Thomas and me, and helped to cement our lifelong love of muscle cars.
 We were so proud of our mother and we loved to tell our friends where she worked.
 Our friends would openly wonder why a mother would be working at all.
 It was very unusual in that time period not to have a father.

I like her."
 It was nearly midnight when they left.
 "Thank you for the little fountain," Marie told Rick as he unlocked her car door.
 "I haven't bought it for you yet."
 "But you want to.
 You decided to as soon as I admired it.
 Thank you."
 She linked her arms around his neck, smiling into his eyes and then raising her face to kiss him.
 His hands wandered over her back as he returned her kiss.
 "Wow," he murmured, resting his forehead against hers.

“Will they make it through?” Harruq asked, in awe of the display.
 Qurrah glanced over the wall and then back to the main combat.
 Archers continued eviscerating the orc forces.
 If they could push into the city, their arrows would be a nuisance at best, but it seemed they had underestimated the human soldiers.
 “They are running out of time,” Qurrah said.
 “But they might.”
 He glanced back to the necromancer, and then he saw his eyes, just hints of red underneath the hood of his robes.
 Qurrah shivered as whispers shot up his spine.
 _You silenced my pets,_ it said.
 “I do as I wish,” Qurrah whispered back.

Well, “Hell in Denmark” started that way.
 It’s code, man.
 But, you know, I don’t hide anything from my Love.
 I don’t know, I started out writing this song because I had fucked this chick, see, when I was on tour, when Lor was back here.
 And she sort of followed me around for a couple of gigs, and it was like a lost week, there, I was all screwed up.
 I wasn’t thinking about Lorelei or what this would mean to her, if anything.
 I just wanted to keep balling this chick, right?
 She was blond and willowy and looked like a pixie and I just couldn’t get enough of her.
 Some of my roadies, and Pete, man, God bless him, he was like ‘Buddy, drop this chick, she’s trouble, man.’  He was thinking of Lor.
 So, anyway, this beautiful woman followed me from city to city—she was a gypsy—and she dressed like a gypsy—I can’t tell you her name cuz you’d know it, man.

Through withdrawals again!
 Brandon became sicker every day that his frail body went without the Oxy it craved to survive.
 Brandon had lived away from our house for over a year and he looked like a ghost of himself.
 His eyes were dark, his enthusiastic personality was gone and his mind seemed permanently altered.
 He was 23 years old, 6’ 2” and his weight was hovering at a skeletal 130 pounds.
 We had Brandon on complete lockdown at our house with no visitors allowed, searching his room and the entire house daily.
 We ordered professional quality drug tests so we could test him every day.
 Brandon experienced the worst of the drug withdrawals in the first few days after his arrest.
 My wife, Lisa sat on the bathroom floor with him during his lowest moments.
 He vomited until he had nothing left.

As always, it was already heating up despite the sun having only barely cleared the mountains.
 It did seem like it wasn't quite as hot though.
 Maybe it was getting late enough in the year to bring the temperatures down slightly.
 It was too much to hope it would actually drop to the low seventies, even when December came around.
 I made it down the lane and then started worrying.
 It was like I couldn't win.
 If Britney drove all the way out here and I was already gone because I'd taken the bus, she was going to be really mad.
 On the other hand, if she didn't show, I had no other way to get to school, and Mom would freak out.
 Part of the reason she felt like she could be gone so much ever since the accident was the fact that I always did the responsible thing.
 If she started thinking I was cutting class, she was going be furious.

“Half of my friends are girls,” he said.
 “You know what I mean.
 Don’t you get horny?” “Yeah,” he said.
 “Only, for me, it’s too soon.
 I’ve got a bunch more to learn.” The last couple months of that summer, while I smashed golf balls, played baseball in Mexico on Sundays, and visited my cousins in Pacific Beach, Eric ran around with Margaret Beasley, Pam Greenman, and Lane Campbell.
 Margaret had been my friend longer than anyone except my cousins.
 Since second grade.
 All through elementary school, she was always the smartest in class, and kinder than anybody else I knew.
 She spent eighth grade in my mom's English and Social Studies class.
 Later my mom called her the brightest student she ever taught.

“Hey, I don’t have anything cool and deadly.
 Why do you both get something like that and I didn’t?
 It’s not like you can trust Jazell with something sharp or dangerous.” “Hey!
 We can’t trust you either.” I pointed out, crossing my arms.
 “Arming you is as scary as giving a kindergartener a knife.” She gasped.
 “Yeah, well, I’m ignoring you now.” She huffed and turned around.
 “There you are!” Jason exclaimed as he crashed out of the trees, panting.
 His wavy hair was a deep red that framed his eyes but he didn’t seem to have noticed its color change or to care.
 He was wearing an all black layered tunic and pants with boots that looked as light as mine.
 If I didn’t know it was Jason, I would have taken a huge step backwards at his assassin-like appearance.

He wanted to protect her, now and in the past.
 When he was sure she was asleep, he went to his own room and took out the pages he'd copied before his sister’s dance.
 Marie Tranton, born 1904 .
 .
 .
 It didn't tell the date of her death.
 That was odd--he was sure it had been in this section.
 His heart began racing as he scanned those pages.
 There was no mention at all of her death--or of her marriage.
 The only information was her date of birth, the names of her parents and brother, and the general family history.

That's why I'm not sure it's such a good idea."
 His face had somehow gotten so close to mine that I could see his eyes, and they were dead serious.
 I'd never noticed how clear his eyes were.
 They were the purest blue I'd ever seen, and looking into them was like trying to plumb the depths of a bottomless spring.
 I could see further into him than I ever could with Brandon, and there wasn't any deception there.
 I nodded, and then buried my face against his chest as I cried myself out.
 It was several minutes before I was able to speak again.
 "You're so ready to send me away it's hard to believe sometimes that you really want me here."
 Alec stroked the side of my face, ending by tucking a strand of hair back in place behind my ear.
 "I really want nothing as badly as I want you here.

The military have at their disposal scientific and technological resources which in many cases can be applied to environmental protection with the minimum of adaptation, such as information and monitoring systems that track changes in the atmosphere, in the oceans and on earth’s surface.
 These resources can be applied to environmental monitoring and impact assessment, protection of endangered species, quick response to disasters and accidents, energy conservation, and the minimization and management of waste.
 The appropriate role for the military in these various activities will depend on the country, the urgency of the circumstances, and the cost-effectiveness of military involvement compared with available alternatives.
 In some instances, it may be feasible to establish international ‘Earth corps units’, specially trained and equipped to carry out certain types of environmental protection and restoration, such as India’s eco-battalions, which seek to conserve the Himalayan habitat by restoring tree cover and constructing small dams and canals.
 International development force
 The goals of peace, prosperity and fulfilment for every human being represent formidable challenges – intellectual, attitudinal, organizational and technological.
 We cannot hope to reach such lofty achievements if we waste and squander the precious and abundant resources – mental, psychological, social and material – placed at our disposal.
 A massive reduction in emphasis on weapons production and military establishments, made possible by recent political events and demanded by the pressing unmet needs of people everywhere, represents both a great opportunity and a considerable challenge.
 The opportunity is not only further to reduce the threat of war by reducing the capacity for waging war, but also to redirect and utilize for other purposes the resources now dedicated to war making and prevention.
 The challenge is to do so at a time when rising unemployment and economic stagnation in many countries make further cuts in the size of the military unpopular domestically.

Then a much deeper voice, one that seemed half growl, responded, “She is right.
 This is no sorcerer we fight.” The voice was from his present combatant, the only one who had proven to be dangerous to him.
 “She is right,” Rodregas said, “I am not Ravenhurr.” “We don’t know that,” challenged another voice from the dark.
 As he stepped forward he recognized the shape of the large aggressive man that Rodregas had first thought was the leader.
 “If he is not Gerald, then he must be Ravenhurr.” There was a silent response to that statement, but finally one of the other men lit a torch and held it up.
 Rodregas quickly realized that in front of him were five of the eight prisoners who had been held in the dungeon.
 “How did you track me here?” Rodregas asked.
 The one with the torch waved it over toward the lone female of the group, the half AElfin maiden from the tower.
 “I am afraid you are not much of a woodsman, not that it is easy to hide wagon tracks,” she stated, her voice hinting disapproval at his skill.
 “Still, it was far too easy, even though my people do not count me as one of their better trackers.” Rodregas thought of asking her if she was referring to her AElf or her Nymph heritage as her people, but decided it was best not to ask.

Britney slammed her tray down, but my listless gaze didn't move from the vacant corner where Brandon usually sat.
 A few minutes later a group of girls came to join us.
 I recognized them, but didn't bother putting names to the faces.
 It was like I got hit with another panic attack.
 Somehow I lost an hour, but nobody was running around calling for an ambulance so I must have at least responded to direct questions.
 Alec was sitting in his normal seat as I wandered into physics.
 I tried to remember whether or not I'd already heard the second bell ring.
 It wasn't important though.
 Not compared to the first thing I'd faced in hours that had the potential to hurt me.
 I could feel the edge, razor sharp, cleanly parting some of the layers of gauze that'd been wrapped around my emotions.

Junnie.
 She stared back at me for one brief moment before she turned to fight some invisible foe.
 The stunned moment took the last of the borrowed courage from me, and I drew in, afraid, as my body remained encaged in vine and thorns.
 My legs were wet with blood, arms deadened to the pain and cold.
 I became aware of an unbroken chant, a voice I didn’t recognize, and I turned, stunned again, as I saw Asher.
 He wasn’t in the battle.
 He stood back, seemingly a bystander as the words flowed from his barely moving lips.
 Then he ran.
 Confusion again as Junnie followed after him.
 Chased him.

 No.
 Surprise?
 A little, perhaps.
 Jealousy?
 Certainly not.

 The only emotion he was certain of was confusion.

“…‌must resume,” Qurrah was saying as her spell enacted.
 “It’s dangerous,” Harruq said.
 “I thought you were learning enough from Velixar.”
 “Exactly,” said Qurrah.
 “But I must practice what I learn.
 These nights are not enough, will never be enough.
 What point is sharpening your sword if you never wield it?”
 Harruq had no reply.
 Eyes low, he stepped out into the night, Aurelia trailing not far behind.
 They travelled deeper into the town.

I hadn't even realized I was thirsty until that second.
 "I'm sorry, Adriana.
 I know I can depend on you, this is just important enough that I needed to make sure you understood what's riding on your discretion."
 I finished with the first third of the bottle, and then nodded.
 "I won't say anything.
 What exactly are we going to see?"
 "Not a what, but a who."
 Much like he'd done when we'd been fleeing from my house, Alec picked me up and then slung me around so I could wrap my legs around his waist, and my arms around his neck and chest.
 This time Alec wasn't sprinting, but he still set out at a pace that made conversation impossible, so I just relaxed into him and enjoyed being so close for a second time today.
 Once we stopped, I slid down Alec's back and looked around.

He was in the local jail and had been calling friends to bail him out.
 Our son hadn’t called us for bail; I had told him that he shouldn’t bother me when he got busted, one thing I had said that had apparently sunk in to his thick head.
 He was alive—a relief—but we had no idea how much trouble he was in.
 The thoughts of trial and incarceration were unthinkable, but they were likely.
 The memory of accompanying my mother half way across the country to visit my brother in jail came back strong.
 I called the jail and received minimal information beyond his bail amount.
 We opted to leave Brandon in jail.
 He was released 23 hours later on his own recognizance.
 Brandon spent the days after his release from jail back at our home as we attempted the daunting task of detoxing him.
 Through withdrawals again!

I hadn't seen any other boys who were even close to as attractive as Alec and Brandon, and Jasmin didn't seem like the type to pick substance over form.
 Britney had wandered off to other, safer subjects.
 I nodded a lot and tried to avoid thinking about what life was going to be like if Jasmin was determined to kill me.
 There was just no way to know if I'd made the right choice in leaving when I did.
 Would Cassie hate me a little less because we were both potentially in Jasmin's crosshairs, or would she hate me all the more because I'd seen her humiliated and forced to back down?
 I finally finished the little can that represented my lunch.
 I wasn't particularly hungry, but I couldn't lose much more weight without Mom dragging me into a doctor.
 Besides, it gave me an excuse to try and ignore the fact that half of the people in the room seemed to be staring at me when they thought I wasn't looking.
 I finally worked up enough courage to look across the cafeteria as I peeled the label off of the can.
 Alec wasn't at his usual place, but Brandon was at his normal table, surrounded by a smaller than normal group.

They were whispers but they were clear.
 I listened, hoping to gain clarity… but something was still wrong.
 Nothing fit.
 They discussed Junnie and Anvil and Fannie, but those all felt like two sets of people now.
 They were worried; I could hear the stress in their tones.
 How long had I been like this?
 It seemed so long, trapped here.
 I remembered the vines.
 I tried to feel my arms, see if they were still there.
 Was that why I couldn’t move?

While the Near East, North Africa, East Asia and Latin America/Caribbean regions are expected to achieve average food supplies of 3,000 calories per day by 2010, 200 million people will still be malnourished in South Asia and 300 million, or one-third of the population of sub-Saharan Africa, will suffer from severe food deficits.
 Due to rapidly expanding population, agricultural production in sub-Saharan Africa would have to grow at four per cent annually in order significantly to improve per capita availability of food.
 Thus far, only East Asia has sustained such high growth rates in agriculture, averaging 6.1 per cent from 1970 to 1990.
 This trend, if not halted and reversed, casts a renewed spell of gloom over the hopes of hundreds of millions of people to escape from hunger, and over all our hopes for peace in the twenty-first century.
 The projection of future prospects based on past trends is especially questionable with regard to food.
 Not even some of the most prominent agricultural economists expected the gains in food production which have occurred in the past several decades.
 An international team of experts visiting India in 1963 projected a mere 10 per cent growth in foodgrain production by 1970, whereas growth actually achieved during this period was 50 per cent.
 Neither technological, nor financial nor natural resources pose insurmountable obstacles to achieving dramatically more over the next 15 years than is indicated by past trends or current projections.
 The idea that hunger cannot be conquered because we are running out of land to support rapidly burgeoning populations is contradicted by the facts.
 Globally, there is no correlation between population density and hunger.

Especially not from all the way back there.
 It had to be someone local, and they had to be either rich, powerful, or both.
 The answer was so obvious I felt like an idiot for not realizing who it was from the start.
 Who had I been told, almost from my first day here, were the two most influential families in Sanctuary?
 The Worthingfields and the Graveses.
 Both of which had at least one member of the family my age, one of whom seemed to hate me profoundly.
 What was it the mayor had said?
 "I can't promise he'll even read it."
 It was a he who'd intervened on our behalf, and Rachel and Alec's father had died years ago, while Brandon's father...actually I knew next to nothing about Brandon's parents.
 I wasn't even sure whether or not they were around.

"That's not necessary .
 .
 . "
 He turned back to look at her.
 "Would you rather I didn't?"
 She smiled.
 "I'd rather that you did."
 He returned with a novel that he pretended to read.
 His mind was replaying all the day's events, and he kept peering at Marie over the top of the book.
 She'd washed her makeup off, and she looked like a child, her lashes dark against smooth, rosy skin, one small hand beneath her cheek.

His brother slept peacefully, and in silence the half-orc took the old weapons into his hands.
 He looked to the stars.
 Even as a child, those far away lights had awakened something in him, something so different from what he thought he was.
 Right then, it was awakening guilt and fear.
 “I do what I choose,” he argued to the stars.
 “No, what I _must_.”
 The words felt hollow, nothing more than self-serving lies.
 He kept remembering the mother with her young babe clutched to her breast as she fled from him.
 When he had rammed her, she had tucked the child to guard it from the fall.
 Right before the kill, she had held him, trying to protect him.

He wished the information about her marriage to Davis hadn’t disappeared.
 He could have shown her what her life would be like if she married him.
 But why couldn’t he just tell her what the article had said originally?
 She could draw her own conclusions about what the change in the article meant.
 Excited, he stood and headed for her room.
 But when he reached her door, he hesitated.
 Would she believe him about the article?
 She still felt loyal to that jerk, and she might not believe him.
 Especially since it was pretty obvious that he himself had something to gain by convincing her that she shouldn’t marry Davis.
 His sister had once told him that a girl usually wouldn’t even believe her best friend if she told her that her boyfriend was cheating on her.

The soldiers clearly thought Harruq the more dangerous of the two, and he was more than willing to let them continue thinking that.
 “No jest,” the guard said.
 “You two are leaving this city, now.”
 “My things,” Harruq said, his voice coming out as a weak croak.
 “I don’t see anything,” said the guard, scooping down and retrieving the scattered coins Harruq had dropped.
 “In the shed,” Qurrah said.
 “That where you two live?”
 “Yes.”
 “Fine,” the leader said.
 “Go and get whatever the abyss you can carry.”

A feint, so quick Harruq blocked on instinct, took care of the other.
 His weapons gone, the half-orc was exposed.
 Dieredon wasted no time smashing the half-orc’s groin.
 As he doubled over in pain, a snap kick smacked his chin, splattering blood and forcing him to drop.
 The sharp tip of a blade pressed against Harruq’s throat before he knew what was happening.
 “Move,” Dieredon said.
 “Please, move.
 Give me an excuse to kill you.”
 Harruq was too stunned and disoriented to give him what he wanted.
 Instead he lied there, his nose throbbing and his swords limp in his hands.

I flushed and turned from her, rolling into a ball on my blankets, remembering no more than the feel of his skin on my neck, the quirk of his lips.
 I had to keep distracted, and there was nothing for it but the book.
 I wasn’t able to find much regarding humans in the study’s library.
 But I had been right.
 Illustrations and descriptions matched what I had seen.
 I know I took a risk extending Rune’s spell further, but I did not want to get caught, definitely not followed.
 I wondered if my sister was still at the original camp.
 Surely she wasn’t bright enough to figure it out.
 And apparently she wasn’t willing to tell anyone.
 I was returning to the spot I had found the humans the previous day when I ran across one of them alone.

Once she's gone, I'll come back for you."
 I opened my mouth to ask him what he meant, only to be distracted by the sound of the Jeep's engine as it rolled to a stop on the cement pad.
 As I looked back, Alec's eyes captured me.
 "You're sure this is what you want?"
 I managed a nod, and then the downstairs door crashed open.
 "Adri, honey.
 Where are you?"
 Alec was gone when I looked back.
 Only the slight sway of my curtains gave evidence he'd just casually jumped out of my second-story window.
 I heard Mom's equipment bags hit the floor one after another.

 It was like I'd had too much forced on me too quickly.
 I wanted to just collapse and let unconsciousness overcome me, but something pulled me onward towards the next series of pictures, and then the next after that.
 I wanted to stop.
 Each piece opened up another fragment of my soul, revealing a new pain that I'd kept hidden for the last few months.
 The last picture was next to a door, which I opened almost without realizing I was doing so.
 The organized confusion of a true artist met my gaze.
 I'd seen it with my mom, when she was so driven to complete a shot that she couldn't be bothered to clean up after herself.
 She left just enough structure to the mess to find needed tools, but didn't waste any effort on anything that wouldn't help her with her great aim.
 Brushes were scattered everywhere, old and new canvases stacked in the corners of the studio, and flecks of paint had found their way onto almost every visible surface.

“So the North… has no council at all?” His answer was uncomfortable.
 “No.
 No council.” He paused while he formed the rest of his reply.
 Steed watched him, intent.
 “We are… unruled.” “Unruly,” Steed added with a laugh.
 “You’ve never had a council?” Grey shook his head.
 “No rulers?” He gave Steed a sidelong glance.
 “Not anymore.” I could tell he intended to end the conversation with that but it only made me more curious.
 I was tired of always having to make everyone spell things out for me.
 “No council ever.

“In the village, some of the elves never paired up.” I thought of Junnie’s family.
 “But I guess most of those had received the calling.” Grey scoffed ahead of us.
 I hadn’t realized he could hear us.
 I was embarrassed, but couldn’t stop myself.
 “What?” His horse slowed to fall in with ours as he spoke.
 “The calling?” I didn’t understand.
 It had been a thing of honor, but he spoke of it as if it were a joke.
 “Do you really believe such nonsense?” “What nonsense?
 It isn’t real?” He let out a harsh laugh and I jerked back.
 “Oh, I suppose it’s real.

Now our games were on Friday nights.
 Since Kenny’s mom didn’t care to deliver us for night games, and since we weren’t yet eighteen, she helped us secure border-crossing passes, which we liberally abused.
 Tijuana was wild and ugly.
 We saw fevered children out in the cold, begging on street-corners after midnight.
 I tripped over a dead fellow.
 In the bars, we saw girls get used by both men and farm animals.
 A few times we rode in taxis to motels where prostitutes greeted us.
 We would barter, object to the price, and leave while the coarser of them screeched obscenities.
 Some cabbies, after three or four such stops, stoically delivered us back downtown.
 Others pulled up beside a gang of thugs.

Brandon seemed content to leave me alone with my thoughts as he sped around the various turns at speeds that normally would've made me protest.
 As I went to leave the car, he grabbed me by my back pocket, which nearly made me shriek in surprise.
 "Hey, you know what you need to put all this in perspective?"
 "No, but then I think it's more than just a matter of my perspective being off."
 My fear of alienating him had almost vanished in the rush of indignation over how he'd grabbed me.
 I wanted to say something even more snarky, but there was just enough worry left to curb my tongue.
 Mostly.
 "You need to come to the party Friday night."
 "You mean the monthly kegger?"
 Brandon shook his head, still flashing the grin that made it almost impossible to remain mad at him.

“Because of me,” I argued.
 “And now you’ve killed one.” But I didn’t know who had killed him.
 Anvil had stood before the man, but any one of them could have snapped his spine.
 “Frey.” Chevelle’s tone was solemn.
 “You know what they did to your mother.” And I could hear what he didn’t say.
 You know what they’ll do to you.
 I didn’t have a counter for that and he knew it.
 He took advantage of the silence, giving orders to Ruby.
 “Take her to the house.” She had me at once, towing me beside her as she retrieved our cloaks.
 Chevelle was still instructing, “Steed, watch the front, stay inside.

They held some of the magic powders used to make the circles that were so important to many of the most powerful of the Immortalist’s spells.
 He checked the powders for magic and several came off very strong so he added them to the pile.
 Two came off with the foulest feel yet, even worse than the books in the studio.
 He could not burn them but knocked them into the middle of the room and then added a couple of the other non-magic powder containers.
 In his final action before he left, he used the crow bar to shatter all the bottles, and made sure to mix the powders together.
 He hopes that would make them impossible to use.
 After moving what he wanted to take with him to his pile at the entrance, he headed down the stairs to the dungeon.
 Rodregas did not want to go down there.
 Some of his worst memories were from his time down in the dungeon.
 Too many terrible deeds had occurred there, not that he had done many of them himself, but he had not been able to stop them.

The other was hanging upside down from a flaming whip that failed to burn him.
 “Get on up, orc,” Aurelia said.
 “Or half-orc, whatever you are.
 I can only keep them like this for a little while.”
 Both men glared at Harruq as he stood, but while their mouths moved and their chests heaved neither produced a sound.
 The half-orc looked to the woman shrouded in the shadows cast by the fallen torch of the patrolmen.
 “I said move along,” she said.
 “I need to give these men a talking to.”
 “I’m going,” Harruq grumbled before staggering down the alley.
 He did not attempt either stealth or silence.

Cindi's had been spring--she hadn't minded the mud.
 My immunity was wearing off; the racing heart was a sure sign.
 I focused back in on what Mom was saying.
 "...you were doing so well.
 Don't worry; this is just a little setback.
 You'll see.
 Being in a different environment will do wonders for us both."
 I knew the rest of Mom's speech by heart, there was no reason to listen.
 Next she'd run through all of the famous, marginally well-known, or even really obscure photographers who got their start in the West.
 It didn't really matter.

“What of the others?” she asked.
 Rodregas was confused by her question and asked, “What others?” Karun answered, “There are a lot of very good squires here, honorable men and women who could benefit from the sigil.” Rodregas’ head was spinning at the idea.
 They were already being hunted by the Immortalists, and gaining some allies was not a bad idea.
 But their luck would only hold so far.
 Doi’van spoke now, trying hard to be quiet, “Only men you would swear have a strong sense of honor and no one who would serve the Immortalists.” Karun glanced around the room nervously at Doi’van’s voice; it was just not made for covert conversations and his words were very dangerous.
 Then she nodded thoughtfully and the four quickly agreed that they would share the sigil with anyone who were skilled, honorable and had no love for the Immortalist Guild.
 They returned to their rooms that night tired; they had tracked down twelve more squires.
 All had at least two ribbons; and all swore secrecy at the source of their sigil.
 The biggest surprise was probably Geriodon, who had beaten Rodregas earlier that day.
 Rodregas could not argue against sharing the minor sigil as he clearly fit the description of a worthy candidate.

I think.
 So, most people think they only did “Pushin’ Too Hard.”  Their first album is actually really kick-ass, better than the Stones, if you ask me, better than 12 X 5, better than Out of Our Heads.
 Inexplicable, really, who makes it and who doesn’t.
 Best not even ponder it.

"His name is Brandon; he picks me up sometimes in the morning."
 I was saved from dealing with her response by Brandon's knock.
 "Hello, Adriana, Mrs.
 Paige."
 I never thought I'd see the like.
 Mom's face lost its stern 'I'm doing this for your own good' look, and instead transformed into something not very different from what I saw every time I watched the girls my age look at Brandon.
 "Well, hello.
 You're Brandon?"
 ** Fifteen minutes later, I was still trying to believe things had gone so well.
 I'd expected Mom to put her foot down and tell Brandon I'd be riding the bus to school every morning, starting today.

“And Ruby Summit.” I attempted a smile for her, not missing the silent exchange between Steed and Chevelle.
 They were trying to decide what to do with me.
 “Since you’re apparently not ready to retire for the evening, I suppose we will resume your training,” Chevelle said.
 I sighed.
 “Ooh, let me!” Ruby shouted.
 Chevelle gave her a doubtful look and then glanced at me, apparently deciding I deserved it.
 He nodded once and walked toward the rock ledge.
 Ruby bounced from foot to foot, celebrating her victory.
 As Chevelle moved past Anvil and Grey, they turned to follow him.
 The silver-haired elves and their dogs were nowhere in sight.

Doi’van shot another arrow almost straight down into the back of the neck of the downed guard.
 The man thrashed once and then laid still.
 The second body flew by in a blur.
 With such swiftness, Rodregas reasoned, he must have a sigil of speed.
 He headed right for Doi’van and was behind Rodregas before he could do anything.
 Doi’van must have seen him coming from his position and he dropped his bow and pulled his great sword.
 The guard must have been thinking “Forest Nymph” due to the nature of the archery attack from the forest because he was unprepared for the strength of the blow.
 Like the one Rodregas had hit, the sword failed to cut armor.
 The guard, with the speed of his sigil, blocked it.
 But he blocked it sword to sword instead of using the momentum and speed to simply guide the sword away from his body.

Dad had always kept at least a pair of rose bushes alive.
 He'd loved nothing more than giving Mom roses.
 Once I'd safely done my part to help prolong the future life of the gorgeous specimen, I got down to really examining it.
 I was far from an expert on roses, but I'd looked through pictures of hundreds of different kinds of tea roses, and never seen anything quite like this one.
 It was as big as some of the largest specimens I'd seen, and had at least fifty percent more petals than most of the 'very full' varieties I was familiar with.
 That in and of itself was pretty amazing, but nothing in comparison to the petals themselves.
 They were the purest white edged in a breathtaking purple.
 Equally amazing was just how velvety they were.
 They looked like the softest thing in the world, and cried out to be touched.
 I expected to be disappointed as I leaned in.

 We have them sometimes to celebrate things."
 "Like what?"
 Brandon shook his head as he pulled me back down into my seat.
 "Nope, if you want to find out, you'll have to come to it with me."
 "You know, I don't usually leave conversations midway through.

The same process of structural transition is repeating itself today and raising the same anxieties.
 Contrary to common belief, the US employment rate, the percentage of total population with jobs, has risen steadily throughout the century from 38 per cent to 46 per cent of the total population and is expected to reach 51 per cent by 2005.
 This trend is true for the industrial nations as a whole.
 Between 1960 and 1992, total employment in OECD countries rose by 110 million jobs or 44 per cent, including a 22 per cent increase in the participation of women in the workforce.
 During this same period, un employment rose by 23 million persons, representing a 259 per cent increase in the overall unemployment rate.
 More people are working than ever before, yet at the same time more people are unemployed, because a larger proportion of the population seek jobs.
 Growing anxiety about employment prospects in the West were aggravated by a sudden 50 per cent increase in unemployment after 1990, which displaced an additional 10 million workers in the OECD and was equalled only by the previous high of 1983.
 This increase is now showing signs of reversal.
 These average figures disguise significant differences in performance of countries within the OECD.
 Since 1950, Japan’s employment rate has risen from 43 per cent to around 50 per cent, while unemployment has remained in the 1 to 3 per cent range.

It started to refract light, but there was only darkness around my vision of her.
 The wind picked up and her dark hair began to whip back and away from her face.
 She was smiling, glorious now, her arms outstretched.
 The pendant started to glow and the darkness cracked.
 The wind was howling.
 I could barely see.
 Or maybe something was covering my face.
 When I screamed the sound was lost.
 I tried again, but suddenly I was mute.

Oh, how he would rub my face in this shit.
 You would think with all my experience around drugs that I would have known what to do.
 That is exactly what I thought!
 Brandon was sickly and skinny.
 My wife lay with him for hours rubbing his back and keeping fluids in him.
 He went from cold to hot and back again.
 In a couple of weeks he was looking much healthier and we sent him out into the world again.
 Turns out, just because I did drugs and knew people who were addicted to drugs I was still not qualified to understand how to break someone from craving the drugs that satisfy their addiction.
 Brandon seemed better and we thought we had helped him simply because we incarcerated him at home away from his peers until he had the drugs out of his system.
 In our mind, he was cured.

 “Alright, then you can come this morning.
 We’ve got to hurry though, or we’ll be late.”

The expansion and intensification of cultivation of these products will raise agricultural output by $25 billion and generate approximately 45 million equivalent full-time unskilled and semi-skilled jobs in agriculture for unemployed and under-employed farmers and landless labour.
 The additional agricultural production will form raw material for expansion of rural industrialization and non-farm employment.
 Another 10 million jobs will be created in downstream agro-industries located in rural areas - in sugar mills, cotton and textile mills, processing units for fruit, fish and silk, and in marketing and distribution - thus serving as a counter-magnet to urban migration.
 Growth of agro-industry will stimulate demand for industrial machinery and services.
 The multiplier effect of skyrocketing rural demand will stimulate demand in a broad range of consumer industries and create an estimated 45 million rural and urban jobs in industry and services.
 Funding for the strategy would come from a mix of public sector and private sector investment.
 The funding requirements are within the range of current five-year projections: 84 per cent of additional planned investment in agriculture and 25 per cent of additional planned expenditure in industry.
 The average cost per additional job is less than $1,000, roughly one-tenth the average cost of jobs in India's private sector and one-hundredth the cost of new jobs in the public sector.
 Implementation of the strategy will require a substantial investment in training of both on-farm and industrial workers, but the plan is based on the recognition that enhancing the skills of the nation's rural work-force will take time and must be done incrementally.
 As the programme gains momentum and rural incomes rise, the demand for industrial products and services will grow, resulting in a shift to greater farm mechanization and gradual movement of more and more workers to non-farm employment.

Back then, I often read The Daily Word, which frequently repeated the message, “Let go and let God.” What we churchgoing folk might call surrender.
 Surrender is the remedy, at least for panic attacks.
 Maybe for everything.
 As I pass the turnoff to my former home in Chico, I think, surrender must make perfect sense to anyone who adores God like Brother Lawrence did.
 When we are around someone we adore, our defenses cave in, because the only thing we fear, the only thing that needs defending, is the communion with the one we adore.
 If we adore God and live in His presence, we are in constant communion with the eternal, way beyond death.
 So, what’s left to fear.
 The enemy is truly us, in particular the defenses we have established between us and God.
 Vanquish our defensive selves, we are set free.
 One of the songs on my I-pod, "I Surrender All," has long been a favorite.

Why I never heard my dad practice at the house.
 Why, even his record collection of big band and swing music stayed dusty.
 My mother squelched my father, I think.

 I think my father was a man with a lot of soul, a lot of creativity that just festered, just rotted inside him like cancer, until, well, it turned to cancer and that killed him.
 CM:  	But, he was a lifelong smoker.
 BG:  	Yeah, yeah.
 People die from cigarettes.
 But more die from fettered ambition.

He had had enough.
 Condemnation flew through the air, its aim true.
 The blade sank into the elf’s back.
 Blood and fluid covered the carpet as all life fled the body of Ahrqur Tun’del.
 Harruq strolled forward, the sound of his ragged breathing filling the sudden quiet.
 He drew out his sword, grimacing at the sick wet sound it made.
 “What do we do about all the blood?” he asked.
 “We will clean it, but first we must drain the body.”
 The two dug through dressers upstairs, grabbing old and expensive robes and shirts.
 They then dragged the body outside to where the deceased elf had kept a private garden.

I should have been worried I was upsetting my only 'friend'.
 Failing that, I should at least be mad she was being so unreasonable, but my racing heart brushed those feelings away.
 Other than a persistent, imaginary tingling along my shoulders I was strangely numb inside as I followed her into the tutoring room.
 There were more kids inside than I'd expected, enough that a normal room would've felt crowded, but this wasn't a normal room.
 Someone had knocked down a wall or two, creating a space that was strangely welcoming, despite obviously being meant for academic pursuits.
 A large number of rectangular tables were scattered about the room, situated so that the two people sitting at them would feel relatively isolated.
 As I continued my survey, I realized that there was only ever one pile of books at any given table, and in the few instances in which two people were sitting at a table, one of the individuals was obviously explaining something to the other one.
 Most of the kids looked fairly run-of-the-mill.
 There was even the expected contingent of jocks, obviously there just because a coach or parent had delivered some kind of ultimatum.
 Britney predictably headed over and staked out a table as close as she could get to a group of girls who were probably cheerleaders.

The captain had been a big man but not as large as Rodregas now was.
 Still the soft linen shirt of light brown, which he knew had been loose on the captain, was much more comfortable than the wizard robe he had been wearing.
 Unfortunately none of the pants would fit.
 Poir, though a large man, had skinny legs.
 Rodregas felt ridiculous wearing only a linen shirt and his coin purses as he stepped to the armory door.
 The door was built of massive slabs of iron oak.
 Rodregas reached up and pulled the emergency key from the crack at the right of the door.
 Due to his status as a senior sergeant, he knew where the key was kept.
 Once the door was open, he stepped inside.
 Immediately, his eyes went to a long side bench where several new pieces of armor were piled up.

He started to jump up as a humanoid shape appeared out of the trees, until he saw that it was just Imeralda.
 She seemed to be paying less attention now to stealth as she was to speed.
 From Imeralda’s expression Rodregas knew it was something more dangerous than a trade caravan coming down the road.
 Imeralda squatted down next to them and whispered, “A slave caravan is coming; it’s small but they have a score of guards.
 We need to back up before they get here.” “We have good cover here,” he whispered back, “let’s check them out as they pass.
 They are probably going to stop at Stallion’s Perch.” After much debate between the three of them Stallion’s Perch was their destination, a small keep that was known to breed Dire horses for the Immortal Guard.
 “We can’t,” responded Imeralda with a whisper.
 “They are traveling with a patrol of Immortal guards.

Art – Did he say when he would be back?
 Karen – Just later.
 Jim – He’ll be here, its his favorite holiday.
 Karen – I didn’t know that Johnny was so sentimental.
 Art – He isn’t, he just likes the food.
 The boy would crash a wake if the food were good.
 Jim – He actually wanted to do that once.
 Art – He didn’t do it did he?
 Jim – Nah, Liz and I talked him out of it.
 Art – I didn’t think reasoning with the boy would work.

In recent years, unemployment has emerged as a major cause of concern for governments around the world.
 In industrial countries, the subject evokes pessimistic prophecies of a fast-approaching future in which tens of millions of people will never find jobs, technology eliminates the need for human labour, cheap imports replace domestic jobs, welfare systems collapse under an unbearable burden, children have less economic opportunity than their parents, a widening abyss divides the rich and poor, and both markets and governments are powerless to do anything about it.
 In developing countries, it dashes hopes of ever conquering hunger, eradicating wide spread rural and urban poverty, and bridging the gap that separates these nations from the prosperous West.
 The very same deterministic mentality that until recently made us feel that a nuclear war was inevitable now leads many to conclude that rising unemployment, chronic poverty and social alienation are unavoidable.
 Yet the enormous gains of peace and democracy that we contemplate cannot be secured and brought to fruition if this other apprehension is allowed to become a settled reality, as war between nations has been during past millennia.
 The peace and security we seek internationally depend directly on our ability to promote and maintain domestic peace and tranquillity within nations, which in turn are dependent on the ability of countries to provide food and economic security to their people.
 Poverty and unemployment are closely linked to most instances of social unrest – tribal wars, civil wars, urban crime, drugs and violence.
 There is clear evidence from the US and UK that crime is economically related to lack of job opportunities.
 Unemployment is also a major cause of massive migrations, both to urban areas within countries and across borders, which has become a highly destabilizing factor in many regions.
 Without sufficient purchasing power for food and other material essentials and non-essentials, there can be no assurances of lasting social peace and political stability.

He'd been so sure he was going to die that he'd relaxed his normally rigid rules.
 Since then he'd done everything possible to keep me at arm's length.
 Everything short of sending me away.
 Growing up with the example of his mother was a powerful object lesson regarding what happened to humans that got involved with shape shifters; but given enough time, I'd exploit that tiny piece of him that wanted exactly what I wanted.
 "Unless you're sending me away there's no point in having this conversation.
 I'm exactly where I want to be.
 It's not like I'm throwing myself at you this very second.
 Have you come up with an explanation for that yet?"
 Alec stared back up at the clouds rather than meet my eyes.
 "Not yet.

"Adriana."
 I spent too much time correcting my mom.
 It came out a little rude.
 I would have tried to smooth things over but I was too busy trying to brace myself against the panic attack I was sure was coming.
 My vision swam for a moment, but all the practice compartmentalizing my mind seemed to be paying off.
 I looked up.
 Britney looked a little crestfallen.
 She was probably deciding to ask for a different seat assignment after class.
 "Sorry about that.
 I don't really like it when people shorten my name.

He closed his eyes.
 This time, he didn’t grab just one thread.
 He grabbed them all.
 They screeched and twisted in his grip.
 His head pounded, and the pull on his chest was so great he felt he might pitch over the wall to his death.
 Qurrah’s well of magic drained at frightening speed.
 He almost let go, but he thought of his brother, shaking under the spell of the skulls.
 _No,_ he thought.
 _Enough.
 Cease your chatter._

Others talk about the size and welcoming essence of Lorelei’s breasts.
 Buddy was mothered; he fed there like a suckling, like a child.
 It wasn’t love but it was something between the sacred and the profane.
 Some say Lorelei was responsible for the beginning of the slide downward for Buddy, filling his head with ideas of stardom, of leaving the backwash of Memphis and making it in a real town like L.A. or Boston.
 Buddy listened to Lorelei, we know that, for better or worse.
 Let’s hearken back to a happier image.
 A small recording studio.
 A three-piece band, occasionally four when Jim Dickinson stops by and plays a little keyboards.
 A 20X20 room covered in egg-cartons.
 The preternatural silence beforehand.

In Minnesota you could always pick out the alpha females by the length of their shorts, and this one seemed to think she was at the top of the food chain.
 That or a complete slut, but with her tan skin and perfect wavy hair, I figured it was probably the former.
 She didn't look like she had to put out to get attention.
 Two minutes later, a smiling blond secretary came waddling out of what was probably the principal's office.
 I spent the time wondering if I should try to make small talk; the gorgeous girl spent it staring out the window.
 The secretary took in the two of us, frowned almost imperceptibly at the length of the shorts and then signed a form for the other girl.
 Determined to at least try and make friends, I started to smile as she turned towards me on her way out, but the expression died as soon as I met her flat green eyes.
 My heart immediately started to race, but she was already gone, moving with grace and confidence out of the suddenly too-small office.
 I'd expected some degree of cliquishness from such a small-town, but this was bad.
 I'd never seen her before, so there wasn't any way it could be some kind of misunderstanding.

If it was a lie, Seth and I could kill him anyway in a blink of an eye.
 “Seth, maybe we should hear what he has to say.” “I’ve had enough of listening to dwarfs,” Seth hissed.
 “All they bring me is bad news.” The dwarf was trembling.
 “Oh please, sir, listen to the good lady!
 I do not bring news that will cause you pain, but I bring news of the pain of others.
 You must listen, it is my task!” Seth looked at me and I nodded.
 He sighed and lowered his weapon to the ground, its tip digging into the dirt.
 The dwarf relaxed a little, but its body was still full of tension.
 “Thank you, sir!” he squeaked.
 “Her majesty requests that I tell you about you’re real destiny.

You're all the same.
 Okay.
 Assuming my mom takes off for the night, I'll go, but only on the condition that you behave."
 I managed to make it to the door without my knees knocking together, but it was a close thing.
 I'd been scared sick when he'd been about to kiss me, but it had at least been something I'd been dreaming about off and on for years.
 I wasn't sure I was ready for the other things he was starting to imply.
 Chapter 20 There were a couple of times between Monday and the end of the week where I didn't think I was going to survive having to worry about whether or not I'd be able to sneak out to Brandon's party.
 My dreams had taken a decidedly odd turn.
 I'd had the lucid, vivid dreams every single night, but my guilty conscience seemed to be working overtime.
 At least that was all I could assume.

Elves appeared in the windows of every building that lined the center.
 Full quivers hung from their backs.
 Sixty more elves joined their lone companion on the street and readied their bows.
 The men in the center raised their shields, but they knew the deadly aim of a trained elf.
 They were about to be massacred.
 “Stand firm!” Antonil ordered, raising his own shield.
 “Stand firm.
 Do not break formation!” A shout came from the elven side, and then the hail began.
 More than a hundred arrows rained down on the army, each deathly precise in its aim.
 Not one hit flesh.

Wondering if Rick had heard her, she glanced over at him.
 He hadn't moved.
 Raising her head, she leaned a little closer to him.
 He was asleep!
 She lay there for a few more minutes, but she was too restless to keep lying still, especially with no one to talk to.
 So at last she jumped up and ran into the waves.
 Rick woke up slowly with no idea of how long he'd been asleep.
 It had been an exhausting week, and he'd gotten less sleep than usual.
 Of course, he'd had much more fun than usual too, he thought with a lazy smile.
 He turned to see if Marie was asleep.

As development becomes imperative, as we approach the turn of this century, we are faced with the necessity of giving new meaning to the word.
 Reflecting on development is thus, in my opinion, the most important intellectual challenge of the coming years.
 Already, it seems clear that macro-economic growth can no longer be deemed sufficient for development purposes.
 Countries pursuing macro-economic growth paths have the necessary foundations for development, but that is only the first part.
 There can be no lasting development with the exclusion of social groups from the fruits of growth.
 Nor can there be long-term prospects for development when the environment is pillaged and the rights of future generations ignored.
 Finally, growth which is not accompanied by the improve ment of the social fabric of society will be only a hollow shell.
 For economic and social development to take place, it is important to promote the expansion of employment opportunities, the improvement of educational and health networks, support for the role of women in development and the pursuit of equality between the sexes.
 A hitherto ignored dimension of the development challenge is democratization: what I have chosen to call political development.
 There have been cases where development was accompanied by an authoritarian political system.

Tonight they mourn.” He stood erect, stretching out his arms as if relishing the warmth of sunshine.
 “Such wonderful dead.
 To die in combat is a glorious fate, Qurrah.
 Never forget it.
 The blessings of gods linger in those who fight and fall valiantly.”
 Qurrah nodded.
 He could feel power creeping out of his master, cold and fierce.
 Soft purple dust flew from his pale hands.
 “The trust between man and elf is broken,” Velixar said.
 “Let the harvest of their distrust begin.”

Eugene – I don’t know.
 I hate that man.
 He’s evil.
 But I guess that doesn’t really matter right now.
 Your mom might not have been the greatest mother in the world, but she never hit you.
 She took me in, and treated me better than my father ever did.
 I don’t know.
 I’ve been trying not to think about it too much if I can help it, it’s just that all things considered I don’t have much choice not to think about it do I?
 Johnny – Why don’t you do something about him if he’s such an asshole?
 Eugene – What do you want me to do about him?

First, he returned home for a week to help go through his belongings that we had placed in storage.
 We ended up throwing away 90% of this junk, as he really didn’t want much of it anyway.
 Rummaging through his old belongings was a grim reminder of his former life.
 Brandon eagerly cleansed himself of almost everything and was resolved to start fresh.
 His stay at Narconon had also exposed him to a minimalist lifestyle completely unlike his prior existence.
 He had learned he didn’t need “things” to prove anything to anybody.
 His ex-girlfriend, Tiffanie, met us at the storage unit to claim her belongings.
 She looked about twenty pounds heavier and it was good weight.
 Tiffanie had been clean and sober since her last relapse in the rehab center.
 They smiled at each other and commented on their vast physical changes.

She looked up and met my gaze for just a second before ducking back down and concentrating on her homework.
 Shy, obviously, and not popular.
 There'd been the hint of a smile on her face, possibly constrained by fear of how her overture might be received.
 Obviously a complete social reject just like me.
 It was nice to finally meet a kindred spirit.
 Britney's clingy neediness was nearly as bad as the icy indifference or borderline hostility all of the rest of the students displayed.
 Except for Brandon, but I couldn't quite bring myself to trust him.
 A boy that cute wasn't nice to a girl like me unless he wanted something from her.
 Mrs. Campbell walked over while I was casing the room.
 She still looked stern, but her face had relaxed slightly.

Tears filled her eyes.
 She’d miss him so much.
 The sky was turning a dark gray when she walked into the garden.
 Grace, their cook, would be getting up soon.
 Her father liked to have a cup of coffee as soon as he woke up.
 Her mother usually got up to have breakfast with him unless it was raining.
 She said she couldn’t drag herself out of bed when it was so gloomy.
 Marie decided she’d ask Grace to make her a waffle this morning.
 She’d like cherries and whipped cream on it.
 She’d go shopping with her mother and maybe have lunch in town.

He wanted to spill the story, but he did not really trust these men.
 He had spent hard years on the road and knew not to trust people that you have just met.
 You especially do not trust people who try to kill you while you sleep.
 And as long as people thought he might be Ravenhurr, maybe a little crazy from a spell gone wrong or something, the less likely the Guild of the Celestial Path would send the Immortal Guards against him.
 So Rodregas said, “Let’s just say I am trying to figure out who I am.
 You can call me…,” he thought for a minute, making it obvious he was making up a fake name.
 He did not want to use his real name.
 He thought to himself, “Who do I want to be?” “If I’m going to try to fight against the Immortalists, then some sort of name fit for a Celestial Paladin, or maybe one fit for an Infernal adversary was needed,” he thought with a smile.
 The only way he could have survived the ceremony would have been divine intervention, so he said the first thing that came to mind, “You can call me Sir Paladin, that will work for now,” he said it with a smile and a slight snicker at his own joke.
 “Just what kind of Paladin would you be?” Imeralda asked him.

I mean I didn't come here wanting to learn your story specifically, but there's so much history I don't know.
 There's this shared past that I'm not a part of.
 It's like, oh, I don't know, I think maybe learning about the past will help me understand what's going on right now."
 Mallory's sigh seemed to allude to every one of her presumably substantial years.
 "How very perceptive.
 The past is very much driving what's happening right now, but so much of the past is tied up with the very things from which Alec's trying to protect you."
 I was bubbling with questions, but sensing that now wasn't the time to push, I sat back and waited in silence while she decided exactly how much to tell me.
 "Alec's father was killed nearly two decades ago.
 I don't remember everything about that night, I wasn't even conscious for a large part of the happenings, but the pieces I do remember are sharper than they should be.
 Sharper in my mind now maybe than even when they happened."

I felt weak when I woke, but I was silent about the pain as we continued the journey.
 Yearning to avoid my thoughts altogether, I spent much of the day in the mind of my horse.
 And the day passed.
 It was evening again when we stopped.
 I barely noticed the group’s mood; though quiet, they seemed anxious and kept the perimeter close.
 Ruby brought me the book again and I took one long, deep breath before I started back.
 Freya is growing and strong.
 She has amassed a following of sorts, though I suspect it is somehow connected to her frailties.
 There is something endearing about it, but some of it worries me.
 She doesn’t seem to be able to hear as well as she should through her rounded ears and her voice is oddly alto.

 Rick blinked hard.
 Something was wrong.

 It shrouded most of his garden, including his electric fountain, which he could no longer hear.

 Rick caught his breath, trying to see through the fog.
 He knew that the door .

My courage was gone again.
 He seemed to be waiting for me to speak.
 I tried, “I’m sorry I interrupted…” He nodded, but I didn’t know if he was acknowledging my interruption or pardoning it.
 He walked slowly toward the bed, glancing at Ruby’s things on the shelves and walls, and then sat on the bed beside me.
 I forced myself to continue breathing and kept my gaze down, knowing a flush was coming.
 He reached out and placed a hand under my chin, bringing my face up to meet his.
 The flush that followed was not from embarrassment.
 Heat flooded my neck, and I felt it might engulf me as he spoke my name.
 “Frey.” “Yes.” It was all I could manage.
 His eyes held mine and I could swear he was searching for something.

The string vanished from the bow, spikes pierced the front, and out came the long blades at each side.
 “You foolish mortal,” Velixar said.
 His voice was far deeper than before, less like a man and more like a demon.
 “I do not fear your steel.”
 Pale hands shot upward, hooked in strange formations.
 Dieredon stabbed a long blade straight at the man’s throat.
 The blade halted halfway there, crashing against an invisible barrier.
 The elf struck again, this time lower.
 Velixar’s image rippled as if beneath water, his body protected by some unseen wall.
 Faster and faster Dieredon swung, whirling his blades against where he perceived the wall to be.

Alec shrugged.
 "A paltry sum if it helps ensure a perfect night for you."
 "You've done so much.
 I mean the dress, the shoes, and now this.
 Thank you, but you really shouldn't have."
 His smile was back, and for some reason it nearly pulled tears out of me.
 "I'm glad you like it.
 The fact that everyone else gets to participate is nice, but really it's all for you.
 Of course I did make a couple of stipulations."
 The music started up before I could ask what he meant.

Since 1990, the total number of military personnel worldwide has declined by two million or about six per cent.
 By 1998, a further decrease of at least two million is anticipated.
 A large proportion of these demobilized people have already joined, or will soon join, the forces of the unemployed.
 Some may be tempted to market their military skills elsewhere.
 Just as the present efforts of the UN to make and keep the peace are severely constrained by the lack of a standing professional military force under its own direction, so also the prodigious efforts of the UN’s development agencies to accelerate development among member countries is hampered by a lack of well-trained, disciplined and highly organized personnel for implementation, especially in those countries with the greatest need of assistance.
 The Commission recommends that, as a complement to the establishment of an International Force for Peace, an International Force for Development be constituted, comprised of former military personnel who, after appropriate training, will work to accelerate economic development to provide food, health, literacy and jobs for all.
 A UN Peace Force and UN Development Force, functioning under a democratically restructured UN, can make a lasting contribution to achieving the major goals of the UN system.
 Conclusion
 Seven years ago the threat of nuclear war between the superpowers loomed large in the minds of people everywhere.
 The euphoria generated by the end of the Cold War led to high expectations of peace and a ‘peace dividend’ the world over.

"Do you use this to warm yourself in the winter?"
 "No--it's just for drying hair.
 Here."
 He handed it to her.
 "Comb your hair as you blow it--that'll make it dry faster.
 And this is how you turn it off.
 I'm going to go make breakfast.
 Come down when you're ready."
 The hot air felt good, and it was making her hair fluffy.
 Unfortunately, she didn't have any curling tongs, and her too-long hair, now perfectly straight, hung past her shoulders.

It didn’t move.
 I could see the monster clearly now that I had stepped into its world.
 It was hunched over, occasionally touching the ground with one of its curled front paws.
 Dark saliva dripped out of its mouth.
 The beady black eyes made it no less scary.
 I knew exactly what it is.
 A thrasher!
 A shiver ran down my spine.
 Thrashers were probably one of the most feral and nasty monsters I’ve ever encountered.
 They sometimes travel alone or hunt in packs.

His face twisted in agony as his right arm was dislocated from its socket, leaving the limb hanging limply at the shoulder.
 I was glad I didn’t hear that sound.
 He turned back to his questioner, his mouth a grimace as the words came out, unmistakably a curse, and his other arm was wrenched from its place as well.
 He winced, apparently not yet numb from the damages, and then his face went hard, his lips pressed together, jaw clenched tight.
 He wasn’t going to scream.
 Or talk.
 His back twisted and he fell, a motionless heap on the ground.
 His body was bent out of recognition.
 It was over.
 My ears had stopped ringing the moment he’d hit the ground.

They might have been council, but it didn’t stop the feeling of betrayal.
 They’d lied to me, acted as if they’d cared.
 I was done with them.
 With everyone.
 I wanted as far away from all of it as possible.
 But I didn’t make it far.
 Exhaustion caught up with me a few miles later and I found an old oak tree, sliding down its massive trunk to rest my aching legs.
 I’d never run so far in my life and my head throbbed.
 I was seething with anger and frustration and the feeling of being ensnared.
 I didn’t sleep.

He walked silently at her side.
 When they were back inside, she didn't go upstairs to change.
 Instead, she went to the living room and sat in a corner of the sofa, erecting an invisible wall between them.
 Bewildered and a little hurt, he sat down on the opposite end and turned on the TV.
 After a few minutes of channel surfing, he pressed the mute button.
 "What's wrong, sweetheart?"
 he asked, turning toward Marie.
 "Are you homesick?"
 "Don't call me that."
 She stared at the TV screen.

An incorporeal hand shot from Qurrah’s own, flying across the battlefield to where an elf dove toward them, arrows flashing two at a time in the starlight.
 The hand struck the elf in the chest, freezing flesh and eviscerating his insides with ice.
 The flying horse banked upward as its master fell limp into the fog.
 “Beautiful, Qurrah,” Velixar said, bloodlust burning in his red eyes.
 His precious undead were being massacred.
 He could feel their numbers dwindling in his mind, now but a third of what his glorious army had been.
 “This has gone on long enough,” he seethed.
 He outstretched his hands and shrieked words of magic.
 Qurrah staggered back, in awe of the power that came rolling forth.
 The fog of darkness swirled and recoiled at each word Velixar spoke.

He knelt in front of us.
 “Drink.” Yes, I was thirsty.
 So thirsty.
 I took a long pull and then another.
 I couldn’t seem to quench the thirst.
 He took the container from my hand.
 “Enough.” My stomach roiled and I realized what I had drunk.
 “Ugh, cat pee.” I thought I might hurl.
 How much of that healing crap had I drunk?
 I heaved once and Steed shook beneath me with laughter.

 Inside felt like a modest rendition of Ahrqur’s home.
 Stairs in the center led to the upper floor.
 Harruq charged up them, making no attempt at silence.
 Either they would hear him through the chaos of battle or they would not.
 It turned out they did.
 An arrow flew across the room and pierced his shoulder when he reached the second floor.
 He bellowed, letting the pain spark his rage.
 One archer continued to fire out the window, believing his companion capable of finishing a single warrior.
 He believed wrong.

“Hm?
 What is it Seth?” “I've been hiding this from you for a long time,” Seth began.
 “Only Jazell knew what it was because she found out that I was hiding something, and demanded to know what it was.
 So I told her, and ever since I did she's been bugging me to tell you too.
 But I didn't want to, I was afraid that I would get you worried about nothing.
 So far it hasn't turned out to be nothing.
 The incident with the faery guard showed that clearly.” I walked over to him and sat at his other side.
 I gave him a smile.
 He smiled back and continued.
 “The faery could have easily stabbed me through the heart but he didn't because he wanted me alive; to give to Kojas.” Emily gasped and covered her face.

We are smarter than most realize, you know that.
 Our features are sharper, and we only resemble the orcs that attacked Veldaren.
 It is a part of us.
 Unwanted, perhaps, but I shall not cower and hide a part of who I am.”
 “Just strange, is all,” Harruq said.
 “Life is strange.”
 They both lay down to rest, a new life awaiting them in Woodhaven.

With a sigh of resignation I walked over to the chair where I'd left my selections from the night before, and pulled the faded jeans up my frail-looking legs.
 I finished up with a tank top, covered by a light blue blouse.
 All Cindi's stuff.
 Thoughts of her were just as dangerous as they'd been last night, but maybe I was getting a little better.
 Feeling like a traitor, I headed my skittering thoughts off before they could start affecting me physically, and focused on the next step in getting ready.
 There was a lot more at stake this morning than last night.
 If I fell apart now I might not make it to school, and then I'd have all kinds of trouble calming Mom back down when she returned from wherever she'd gone.
 My hair hung as limp and straight as always.
 No amount of styling ever made it look any better, just more contrived.
 Makeup was the same way.

I haven't seen that many people here ever."
 If there was one thing that'd always pissed me off, it was people who refused to own up to their mistakes.
 In my mind not being where you said you were going to be, especially after being so jazzed about it previously, fit into that category.
 Rachel wasn't making a good start.
 "Why don't we cut to the chase, Rachel?
 You didn't go to Les Misérables.
 We spent more than a week planning what we were going to do on the way up and the way back, and you didn't bother to show up."
 Rachel's mouth opened and closed a few times.
 She looked around, but we weren't the only two people in the room.
 James was barely visible pacing up and down the far end of the hall, so there wasn't any help there either.

I reached out with magic, drawing Steed’s head around to press him back to me, climbed up, and clicked my heels hard to catch Chevelle.
 He was riding too fast again and I was not looking forward to the day, sure it would be worse than the already miserable morning.
 I rode up beside him, planning a snide remark about the trick, but was distracted by a black stone in his hand.
 It was odd-shaped and just smaller than my balled fist.
 Onyx, I thought, though I’d never seen the stone that big.
 His gaze was intent.
 “Be prepared at all times.
 This will come at you from every direction.
 It is the only way you can learn to respond quickly.
 You need to get past that block, to use your defense as instinct.” I really didn’t want to play anymore.

"That's what's so amazing about you.
 Almost everyone else at school was born here.
 They essentially look at every action as choosing between Alec and I. Britney, who could have legitimately stayed neutral, has been trying to get in my good graces almost since she arrived.
 You, on the other hand, couldn't care less who has the most money."
 It was an explanation.
 Not an iron-clad one, but good enough for now.
 I thanked Brandon for the ride, and was rewarded with one more wide, open smile before we split up and headed our separate ways.
 I kept telling myself not to get caught up in the idea of being with someone for the first time in my life, but still went through the first two classes more or less in a daze.
 Mrs. Sorenson was just as nasty as she'd been every day this week, but I didn't care when she managed to stump me on her second question.
 I found myself subconsciously comparing Heathcliff with Brandon during English, and Mr. Whethers had to ask me a question at least twice before I realized he was talking to me.

Powered by these revelations, she prayed with intensity and perseverance.
 And God responded by urging her to give herself entirely to him.
 She assured him she was all his.
 For some weeks, he allowed her to rest on that answer, but more and more she became uneasy with it, until she realized she didn’t by any means belong entirely to God.
 Most of her thoughts, concerns and energies went to her family.
 She was the mom of three wonderful kids and the wife of a loving husband.
 In horror, she returned to intense and persistent prayer, telling God he couldn’t possibly mean she should leave her family, could he?
 Rather than reply with words, he used silence, like Tae Kwon Do Master Jeong used to do when one of us students offered an excuse for not training often enough.
 For weeks she waited, listened, and prayed God would at last reply that he had only been using the method through which he tested Abraham’s willingness to obey at any cost.
 Once she declared herself ready to forsake her family, he would release her from the need to do so.

She stripped them of their beauty, their intelligence, and their long life.
 They weren’t evil, Harruq, but Karak offered them strength and they accepted it.
 The dark god drove them to war against elves and men.
 Finally the orcs were banished to the Vile Wedge between the rivers.”
 “Do any still worship Karak?”
 “Most don’t,” Aurelia said.
 “They’ve turned to worshipping animals now.
 I’ve even heard of some worshipping Celestia once more, hoping she will forgive them and remove their curse.
 They are a sad race, Harruq, but believe me in saying there is no shame in your blood.”
 The half-orc shifted uncomfortably, unable to meet Aurelia’s eyes.

In the developing world, more than 80 per cent of the water is utilized for agriculture, an unsustainable level that is depleting water tables, increasing soil salinity and accelerating erosion.
 Although historically water has often been a source of contention between communities, it has never been the cause of an open inter-state conflict.
 However, nearly one-half of the world’s land surface consists of river basins shared by more than one country and more than 30 nations receive more than one-third of their water from outside their borders.
 Therefore, the danger of confrontation and conflict will escalate unless concerted measures are implemented urgently.
 Water shortages occurring in combination with other sources of tension — such as in the Middle East — will be particularly worrisome.
 Famine remains a persistent threat precisely because the world no longer feels that threat to be severe.
 India’s last major famine occurred in Bengal in 1943 during World War II.
 Although the deficit in food production was only marginal that year, three million died for lack of strong administrative intervention to improve distribution.
 A marginal deficit could work havoc in the absence of an efficient and equitable public distribution network.
 While there is no scarcity of food in the world, there is also not a sufficiently organized effort to promote food security, precisely because the sense of urgency is lacking.

 "All right."
 "Come on--you can sleep in a guest room."
 "Wait."
 She pressed her lips together.
 "May I sleep here on the sofa?
 I-I'd rather not be so far from you."
 "OK."  He smiled, going to the linen closet and returning with a sheet.
 "Here you go.
 Yell if you need anything."

It seemed like I could still feel him though.
 The right side of my body hummed and tingled, almost imperceptibly, telling me he was there.
 I did my best to ignore the sensation, concentrating on the pictures rapidly forming on the ancient blackboard as Mrs. Alexander diagrammed the conceptual model of a wave, and started dissecting the various parts.
 Crest, trough, period, amplitude.
 None of it was hard to understand, not particularly interesting, but still a welcome distraction.
 After what seemed like an eternity, Mrs. Alexander placed the piece of chalk she was using behind her other ear and smiled at the class.
 "Okay, that's your introduction to light.
 Form up into your usual groups and take a project summary; you'll be working on this for the next few days."
 I joined the class in filing past the teacher's desk, and then watched as everyone started moving desks around.
 Mrs. Alexander saw me walking hesitantly back to my desk, and intercepted me before I could get there.

Not stagnation, if that’s what you’re implying---
 CM: 	I was—
 BG: 	I haven’t been stagnant because I’ve been still.
 It’s Buddhist, isn’t it?
 I mean, sitting still while the winds blow.
 Winds of change, winds of creativity.
 Lorelei has taught me much, man, many things I can’t even tell you.
 You’ll get it—you’ll see where it’s all been heading.
 Anyway, Memphis, yeah, it’s still part of that—the signpost on the road.
 Memphis still burbles up through even my most contented piece of songwriting, still smolders underneath it all.

Here a bone poked up from the filth, there a fingernail.
 Floating above, transfixed in patient stasis, a soul awaiting a host, shone two crimson eyes.
 * Note from the Author Note from the Author{{{1 A NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR
 I never set out to write a dark fantasy.
 I had two characters in my head, troubled half-orcs without home or family and whose decisions would one day bathe a world with war.
 To tell their story I had to start at the beginning, and the beginning is not kind.
 Reading some letters and reviews, I’ve seen just how dark I’ve gone.
 What you have just read is a slight alteration from my original manuscript.
 I have not changed the brothers’ actions.
 Instead, I have tried to show a bit more into their thoughts, their hearts, and their souls.

They got hopped up on dust and raided the castle.
 We had to kill about six of them before they sobered up enough to reason with.
 That was before Father killed two more just for fun.
 He said he had to prove a point, but I could tell he enjoyed it.
 I straightened and blinked.
 What is this?
 I shook my head and continued.
 My stupid sister was mad because he didn’t let her help.
 She started to throw a tantrum and he stiffened her tongue.
 It was stuck like that for hours.

His magic was too powerful to counter directly and he’d prevented me from ducking away.
 When I was blocking about half the strikes successfully, he pocketed the stone and progressed with sticks, water, fire, anything he found on the trail.
 We were still riding too fast and I was exhausted from the mental and physical exertion when he switched to full-body attacks.
 By nightfall I wasn’t able to fend off anything that came at me and he mercifully stopped the horses beneath another hollow in the mountain.
 I was asleep practically before I slid off my horse.
 The next morning I woke to the sound of rock against rock.
 There was no sign of Chevelle or his horse in the dim stone hollow.
 I sat up, rubbing my sore legs, unable to believe he’d left me.
 And then the rock wall struck me in the face.
 I cursed, my voice hoarse from sleep.

She burst into tears.
 Rick felt awful, but he didn't know if he felt worse for himself or for her.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart," he told her, scooting closer and putting his arms around her tentatively.
 When she didn't resist, he drew her closer.
 "I'm sorry.
 I wish I knew what to do to help you."
 "Stop being so nice to me," she sobbed into his shoulder.
 "What?"
 he asked, bending his head closer to hers.
 "Stop being so nice to me!"

I tripped on a dead root and cursed as I stood back up.
 The slope started to even out more and the trees popped up again.
 Be careful.
 I stopped.
 The voice had come out of nowhere.
 The time is near.
 The voice whispered as faintly as the breeze.
 What, I thought, was that?
 You must stop it.
 I gritted my teeth in annoyance.

The tingly heat that'd convinced me Alec was staring at me earlier was back, and even more intense.
 I felt the tiny hairs on my neck stand up as the feeling redoubled yet again.
 The darker, more vocal of the two opened his mouth and got the first part of a swear word out before ending in a hiss of pain that was almost completely drowned out by a crescendo from the orchestra pit.
 Alec leaned forward, whispered something in each of their ears, and then finally let both of them go.
 I expected them to turn around swinging, or at least swear at him.
 I didn't expect them to remain in their seats stunned and shaking like trauma victims.
 An usher finally arrived to see what all of the commotion was about.
 The older boys shook themselves and then looked for a second like they were going to try and get Alec kicked out of the theater.
 The sense of being caught in some kind of electric sandstorm momentarily intensified, and then faded away as they got up and left.
 I felt my mouth drop open again as they scurried out of the theater without once looking back.

Marie decided she’d ask Grace to make her a waffle this morning.
 She’d like cherries and whipped cream on it.
 She’d go shopping with her mother and maybe have lunch in town.
 After lunch she’d come home to take a nap.
 The house would be hot in the afternoon.
 “Don’t forget to pick up the dry cleaning!” Marie jumped, looking up to see who’d yelled.
 A car door slammed, and she saw a sleek gray car back out of a driveway.
 She’d wandered far from Rick’s house .

Just another day at the office, I guess.
 In a moment, my crack-berry starts to blow up with one call after the next from Ashley, wanting to know when we are doing this deal.
 I must keep buying time with excuses, now nearing a two-hour delay waiting for the cops to come from the other bust.
 It is looking like this deal is not going to happen either.
 I answer some of the calls and ignore others as I am instructed to do by Officer White.
 I whisper in one call as if I can’t talk because I am still stuck at home with my wife and cannot talk freely.
 I reassure Ashley that I will meet her as soon as I can get out.
 I think of my wife and son at home wondering why I haven’t called; is it over?
 Am I dead?
 Finally the crew is all present behind the store, and the review of protocol and procedure began as it did before.

I tried to step forward, tried to follow him, but my vision was dimming and my heart felt like it was about to explode.
 I managed a single step before my knees collapsed and the ground jumped up to meet me.
 Consciousness was slow returning.
 When my eyes finally fluttered open, I was surprised to find myself in Alec's arms once again.
 "Are you okay?"
 He tried to set me down, to stand me up on my feet, but I grabbed onto him as tightly as my shaking arms were able.
 "Don't leave me.
 Please don't make me go."
 I didn't realize I was crying until I tried to talk.
 It was embarrassing, but was I too worried about being sent away to care.

 Cleo – I can’t believe that you are saying what you are saying.

Brandon looked at my white knuckles and laughed.
 "Don't worry, nobody's going to make you drink, and we've never been busted by the cops.
 We'll have you safely back home sometime early tomorrow morning, and your mom will never have the slightest idea you went to such a wild gathering."
 As far as reassurance went, it was a pretty lame attempt, but somehow it didn't sound so feeble when it was Brandon saying it.
 I calmed down enough to marvel at the amount of other baggage Vincent dragged out of the house, and then any chance I might have had to back out vanished as Brandon picked me up and deposited me on the tailgate of Vincent's truck.
 "Riding in the back, isn't that illegal?"
 The high-maintenance blonde Vincent was helping up next to me rolled her eyes.
 "Please."
 Brandon helped a couple of late arrivals into the pickup, and then closed the tailgate.
 I half thought he was going to ride up front in the crowded cab, but he instead cleared the sides of the truck in a jump that was almost inhumanly graceful.

Without another word he strode out.
 Imeralda followed him as did all the squire’s attendants.
 It was time for the final match.
 Rodregas left his shield and mace relaxed at his side and strode over to Nordien, who stood with shield and mace at the ready.
 Instead of attacking he asked the big man, “So, are people right, do you plan to serve the Immortalists if you gain the greater sigil?” The squire looked around a little confused.
 He was clearly not expecting a conversation, but no one was near enough to hear.
 “The Immortalists are the true power of the realm.
 To tie ones self to them is only smart,” Nordien responded.
 “So, you do not deny it,” said Rodregas.
 “It is not to a squire that I am going to either admit or deny such claims.

Her face was a white knife in the darkness of his mind, and he buried her deep within his heart as he yielded to the wisdom of his brother.
 “Yeah,” Harruq said.
 “I understand.”
 “Good.
 Now come.” The two resumed traveling up the small hill.
 They stopped again, however, for from their vantage point they could see the village.
 “See the torches?” Harruq asked, pointing.
 His brother nodded.
 “Velixar’s nightmares have pulled them from their slumber.
 It would be too easy otherwise.”

Britney looked like she had all kinds of things that she'd like to say, but she showed more restraint that I'd realized she was capable of, and kept them all inside.
 "Please explain this one then."
 I ran through three different examples of the same problem before she got it, but thirty minutes later she was finally working on her homework for the first time I'd ever seen.
 I was surprised just how satisfying it was.
 Maybe I should become a teacher.
 Rachel caught my eye before I made it back to my table.
 She gave me another tentative smile as I slid into the seat next to her.
 "I'm really sorry about yesterday.
 I said all of the wrong things.
 It's just I'm not supposed to talk about what Alec says."

He stepped up close looking up at the beast; he was massive!
 The beast’s mouth was open, not as if he was going to roar, but simply in relaxed pose.
 He looked like he had been caught stalking forward on the hunt.
 Rodregas stepped up and just stared at him.
 He was beautiful.
 “Don’t touch,” barked Doi’van.
 Rodregas nodded, he knew not to touch, but then realized that his hand was raised and had been reaching out to stroke the lion’s mane.
 He knew that this was the greater sigil that he wanted to gain.
 It was in a perfect circle.
 He had taken in the essence of the Celestial Lion back at Raven Keep, and now Rodregas would consume his own magical power with the greater sigil of a Celestial Lion and become a perfect vessel for its power.

Follow me.”
 “Lead on,” he said, trudging after his brother into the daylight chaos.

 Out the window Aurelia stared, frowning as she watched the battle unfold.
 “Aurelia,” called a voice from behind.
 She turned to see a female elf, a friend of hers from many years before she moved to Woodhaven.
 “Yes, Felewen?”
 Felewen stood beside her and faced the window.
 Her hair was tied in a long, black ponytail, her slender figure covered by rare chainmail crafted of the hardest metals known to the intelligent races.

I think I’ll go with having been born though.
 For me life is good, even when it’s a giant pain in the nether reigions.
 What do you think Johnny?
 Johnny – I choose C.
 Eugene – And what is C?
 Johnny – If I’m going to be given that much control over my own destiny I’m going to do it right.
 To be born into a family that isn’t crazy.
 Eugene – I would settle for C.
 Jim – Who wouldn’t, but it’s not one of the choices.
 Which side do you lean to then Gene?

Jim – Johnny, do you still have mom’s letter?
 Johnny – What the hell do you mean?
 What does that have to do with what we’re talking about?
 Jim – The letter she wrote when she left.
 Johnny – Why are you asking me that?
 Jim – I’ve heard you repeat it to yourself from time to time.
 Johnny – Why are you spying on me?
 Eugene – (Enters and stays at the edge of the stage, unseen by Jim and John)
 Jim – What do you mean spying?
 You repeat it over and over while sitting and watching television in the living room.

A bridge might mean a village was nearby, and a village meant elves.
 I didn’t want to get caught, not after all this, so I was fully prepared to run by the time I reached the crossing.
 Its stacked gray stones were bulkier than those that had been appearing more frequently on my path.
 Water flowed beneath, smoothing the stones at the base.
 They were so worn, it must have been in place for centuries.
 The leather soles of my shoes skimmed over ancient stone, the bridge curving gently before flattening out into a worn dirt path on the other side.
 It was more traveled than I would have liked, so I swung wide, through the trees instead.
 The wind shifted and the scent of roasting meat assaulted me, dragging my attention, my feet, its way.
 Despite my concerns about other elves, my stomach tightened, my mouth watering as I followed it through the trees.
 They broke into a small clearing, and there in the center stood a cloaked figure, kneeling down as he turned a meat-covered spit.

"And you swim with the shirt on?"
 "I'll take it off when we get there."
 How could she be so small and have such an incredible body?
 Marie glanced down at herself self-consciously.
 "You said that this was very modest."
 "It is."
 "Then why are you looking at me like that?"
 He swallowed.
 "I've never seen anyone who looks as good as you in one."
 She smiled then, reaching for his hand.

Invisible waves somehow heat the food from the inside out."
 He put the bowl in the oven and set it for one minute.
 "Do you have electricity?"
 "My father had our house wired a few months ago."
 "Do you have a television?"
 "A what?"
 "How about a radio?"
 "Yes.
 And electric lights."
 She jumped when the microwave beeped.

More and more excited about the prospect of going to my first real party, I bounced down the stairs and into the kitchen for a drink.
 I happened to look out the window as I pulled a glass out of the cupboard, and nearly dropped it when I saw Brandon leaning against his car, patiently waiting for me.
 Before I could move out of sight, he looked up at me with a self-satisfied smile.
 I nearly dropped the glass again.
 Twenty seconds later I was headed out the door.
 "How did you do that?
 There was no way you could possibly have timed things that close."
 Another smirk as he held my door open for me.
 "I told you.
 Great instincts resulting from superior breeding."

Aurelia smiled.
 Tears were on her cheeks as well, but she left them alone.
 “Bye-bye, Harruq.”
 “Bye-bye, Aurelia.”
 Then she was gone.
 He stood there, not moving, his mind a chaos of fear, swords, Velixar, his brother, and that lingering kiss.
 Then he screamed to the sky, one long, primal roar of hopeless confusion.
 He stormed back to Qurrah, his chest a boiling pot of rage.
 She had not listened.
 He had begged, he had opened his heart, and she had not listened.

Most of the crowd starts to realize what is actually happening.
 The door of the helicopter slides shut and it rises into the air above crowds who lie on their bellies or who have taken off running through the cemetery but one old man, who remains standing with his arms still raised.
 The crowd begins to rise and a collective chuckle begins to infect the crowd as we all realize what we have just experienced.
 I am not making this shit up!
 In the aftermath of this circus funeral, my mother discovered that Dino had borrowed (or conned) a great deal of money from his father, and Dino’s siblings were angry and wanted it repaid by my mother.
 The Greek family rumor was that my mother was sitting on a stash of smuggled diamonds and should sell them and repay the loan.
 There were no such diamonds and there was no money.
 Anyone who owed Dino money disappeared into thin air or claimed they had repaid him.
 My mother was also left bearing the responsibility of a huge IRS tax lien and a mountain of bills.
 Mom and 11-year-old Harry were losing everything to the IRS, and it was just a matter of time before they were broke and homeless.

I never really got myself under control; my sobs just subsided enough for me to tell Rachel I wanted to go home.
 Isaac was standing right outside the classroom door, and unobtrusively helped Rachel get me to his car where she jumped into the back with me.
 Even through the haze of tears I could tell he wasn't happy about the seating arrangement, but once again Rachel showed the kind of iron will she'd demonstrated with James.
 Almost before I knew it we were rolling to a stop in my driveway.
 I fumbled, for the latch, but Rachel put a hand on my arm before I could get the door open.
 She handed me a white-wrapped package with a shy smile.
 "Hang in there.
 Oh, and happy birthday.
 Don't open it now, but I hope you like it."
 I whispered thanks as I hugged her goodbye, and then made my halting, limping way into the house.

Most of all, I want to talk to my mother.
 And--"  She choked back a sob.
 "And what I want most to talk to her about is you.
 I want to tell her how much I love you, how wonderful you are, how getting to know you made me realize that I could never spend my life with Davis.
 I want to tell her how thoughtful you are, how loving.
 I want to tell her how-how.

It was ridiculous.
 I took a deep breath and kept walking, approaching the split.
 He turned to me, scarcely a few feet away.
 “Good morning.” He nodded as he spoke, his voice as smooth as velvet.
 I managed to snap my slack jaw shut at the same moment I realized I had angled my body toward him when he’d addressed me.
 I mentally cursed, but I could recover this; I would just keep going in the same direction as if I were on my way to town, because I was on my way to town.
 There was no need for him to know it was to research someone associated with the Council.
 Someone like him.
 I tried to respond to his greeting, but felt choked and instead only nodded back, my mouth tight as I endeavored to grin with a now clenched jaw.
 I groaned internally, keeping on the path, not daring to look back in case he was behind me.

Liz – I don’t think she would hit on Johnny, he’s too young for her tastes.
 And your father isn’t her type.
 Jim – Lucky them.
 Hate to say this, but your mom is kind of nasty.
 Liz – Yet the gardener and the mailman like her.
 Jim – I’ve seen your gardener, it’s not like women throw themselves at him.
 I bet his porn collection is even bigger than my dad’s.
 Liz – He has my mom.
 He doesn’t need porn.
 Jim – I think the porn would be more appealing.

I have never used my heritage in any way since that day.
 It felt wrong to me that because of my ancestry I could be hired, but I needed a job and this one paid well.
 I worked the 3:00 pm to midnight shift bagging groceries and stocking shelves.
 The money was good and it helped me provide for myself.
 I purchased a 1967 Chevelle SS for $1,000 and I spent a lot of time and money trying to make it faster than the next.
 Hot Rods were as popular in the 70’s as I remembered them in the days of Bob’s Big Boy Drive Ins.
 I adored working on this Chevelle and meeting others who enjoyed the same passion.
 Even though I lived on my own, I was still a kid and I knew no better than to live like one.
 I found myself associated with a group at school referred to by some as “hot-rodders” and by others as “burnouts.” The hot-rodders loved and raced every kind of American muscle car you could imagine, and this was what drew me to them.
 As every school has its “jocks,” “nerds,” “burnouts,” and other cliques and the reps that go along with them, it is difficult for an impressionable adolescent to avoid.

It helped that the Mercedes was so smooth, and that I knew Jasmin had reflexes and reaction time that would've made any Indy racer insanely jealous.
 Apparently there wasn't a single cop on duty, because we made it into downtown Vegas in what I was sure was record time.
 It had to be.
 Jasmin hadn't dropped below triple digits until we were less then fifteen minutes from exiting the interstate.
 It wasn't until we hit the first store that I started to get an idea of what Donovan had been hinting at.
 The shyness Rachel normally exhibited at school was replaced by supreme confidence the moment we crossed the threshold of the first store.
 Armani, Versace, Prada, we conducted a tour de force of them all along with others whose names I didn't even recognize.
 The shopping trip was ostensibly for me, but Rachel cajoled both Jasmin and Dominic into dressing rooms on more than one occasion.
 Amazingly enough, everything she picked out for them fit so perfectly that I began to agree with them that there wasn't much point in even trying anything on.
 The first store we stopped at didn't take us seriously until Rachel pulled out a black American Express, after which every sales person in the entire place lined up to assist us.

Due to rapidly expanding population, agricultural production in sub-Saharan Africa would have to grow at four per cent annually in order significantly to improve per capita availability of food.
 Thus far, only East Asia has sustained such high growth rates in agriculture, averaging 6.1 per cent from 1970 to 1990.
 This trend, if not halted and reversed, casts a renewed spell of gloom over the hopes of hundreds of millions of people to escape from hunger, and over all our hopes for peace in the twenty-first century.
 The projection of future prospects based on past trends is especially questionable with regard to food.
 Not even some of the most prominent agricultural economists expected the gains in food production which have occurred in the past several decades.
 An international team of experts visiting India in 1963 projected a mere 10 per cent growth in foodgrain production by 1970, whereas growth actually achieved during this period was 50 per cent.
 Neither technological, nor financial nor natural resources pose insurmountable obstacles to achieving dramatically more over the next 15 years than is indicated by past trends or current projections.
 The idea that hunger cannot be conquered because we are running out of land to support rapidly burgeoning populations is contradicted by the facts.
 Globally, there is no correlation between population density and hunger.
 China, with only half as much arable land per capita as India, produces 13 per cent more foodgrains per capita.

I sat, using magic to work on the seaming and arrange the pearl strands and beading in a more pleasant pattern while deciding how best to deal with him.
 He was watching me intently.
 “We will have such prosperity.
 Think of it, with your magic, we will be able to conquer anything.
 Whatever we need, whatever we want, it will be nothing but a flick of your wrist.” I froze.
 It was irrational, I knew, but anger seethed.
 I couldn’t stop myself from thinking he was just like everyone else, interested only in my powers.
 My magic.
 And how it would benefit him.
 I turned to him, glaring, and he drew back, startled.

His chuckle pulled my smile wider.
 "No.
 If you're really worried about it just make sure that one of the others are in the room at the same time with you."
 "Now that has some real possibilities."
 I was still rolling the thought around in my mind when the bell rang and Alec pulled me to my feet.
 We swapped out our books and were halfway to Spanish when Vincent and Brandon strode into view.
 Moving so smoothly I was positive that nobody else even realized anything was wrong, Alec swung me around so he was between them and me.
 The tension ratcheted up in step with the rolling waves of energy, as Brandon and Vincent drew nearer.
 They split up when they saw us, casually positioning themselves so Alec couldn't protect me from both of them.
 I felt my knees stop working as I took in Brandon's lazy, confident smile, and Vincent's sick, eager expression, but the gentle pressure of Alec's grasp on my hand kept me from falling down.

Some of them, I’m still proud of.
 I still love “Sandra Leathers.”  And I like Cocker’s version of “Sins of Monk Casaba.” “Satori at the Bitter Lemon,” “Call it the End of Enchantment,” “ Drudge’s Questions,” “The Dotage of a Fairy Tale Hero”…
 LE:  	It was Cassava, dear.
 BG: 	Yeah, right.
 I don’t remember them all.
 For obvious reasons.
 I still like “Overton Park Picnic” especially Soft Machine’s version.
 “Peace is Declared,” “We Bombed in New Haven,” “Wear your Nehru,” “Iris,” “Art Kane’s Jazz Photograph,” uh, “Chloe’s Ancient Face,” “Jack and Neal and Martin Milner”—(laughs), that one for Tiny Tim.
 That still makes me laugh.
 You want me to keep going.

A wordless hiss escaped my throat as I felt the fire coursing through me light in my hands.
 He would burn for this.
 Burn.
 I was standing now, walking step for step toward him as he backed away.
 He said nothing, his face calm as the fire flared and I raised my hands to strike.
 And then everything went black.
 That was when I heard the chanting.
 My ears had been roaring with anger, but all that was left was a soft recitation.
 “Gian Zet Foria.

She started to reply, but the waiter arrived then with her salad and his roast beef.
 Picking up her fork, she told Davis, "Dancing.

 "Mmm."

 "Did you have any place special in mind?"
 "No.
 Any place we can dance."
 She toyed with her salad.

Dieredon bowed one last time and then leapt into the air, using the ledge of a window to swing himself onto the roof.
 He mounted his horse, patted her side, and then took off into the night.
 “Damn it all!” Antonil shouted, slamming his mailed fist into the wall.
 Still shaking his head, he stormed back to the gate, muttering curses.
 “What was that all about?” Harruq asked.
 “King Vaelor asked for aid and the elves declined,” Qurrah answered, chuckling.
 “The King’s pride will not take too kindly to that.”
 “He and his pride can suck a rotten egg,” Harruq said.
 “Hurry or we’ll miss the battle.”
 He pulled his brother down the alley to where a tall, crumbled house leaned near the wall.

Then a white, winged horse swooped down, landing in front of Dieredon.
 “Come, Sonowin,” the elf said to his cherished companion.
 “Let us leave this place while it is still in peace.”
 The beautiful creature neighed in agreement.
 Dieredon mounted Sonowin, needing no reins or saddle.
 Antonil saluted the elf just before his mount leapt into flight.
 “Stay safe, friend,” he said.
 “You as well, friend.”
 Before the elf took to the sky, however, he paused.
 “Antonil…‌something more is at work here.

Still no blood flowed.
 “My name is Dieredon,” the elf gasped.
 “Know it before I send you to the abyss.”
 He fired two arrows, one for each eye.
 They shattered into fire, and finally blood did flow.
 It ran down the dead flesh and bone that was his face, over his black robes, and pooled in the grass below.
 He fell prone, still screaming his anger and fury.
 For five hundred years he had walked the land of Dezrel.
 All that time, all those killings, and this was how he would fail.
 “Karak!” he shouted, all his power fleeing him.

He’d been a junior vice president at Ward and Lee Realty since 2008, a position that involved a great deal of paperwork.
 Sometimes he missed spending the entire day visiting properties and dealing, but the behind-the-scenes work had its own challenges.
 Besides, on the occasions that he did the actual dealing, it was always a prime piece of real estate and clients who were rich or famous or both.
 Boston was a terrific place to be a realtor.
 Just after 7:00 Rick drove onto his own little bit of Boston in the Back Bay.
 He'd had his house built on a beautiful acre that was located on the southeast edge of the area inhabited by Boston's elite.
 Real estate prices there were outrageous, but Rick, with his connections and eye for property, had gotten this parcel for next to nothing.
 It was only a few blocks from the downtown area and considered too close for comfort by true members of the upper class.
 But for Rick it was perfect.
 Both his office and his neighbors were close but not too close, and he had a beautiful lawn in the front and a large patio and flower garden in the back.

He was not sure if he was awake; his mind seemed heavy with dreams, and shifting images.
 It took him a long time before he remembered the battle.
 With the memory came concern for Doi’van and Imeralda, and a surge of adrenaline that gave him the energy to try to wake up.
 Rodregas tried to sit up, but his body, which had been so strong since that day at Raven Keep, now only responded sluggishly.
 He was sleepy, but had the idea that he had been sleeping a very long time.
 Yet, his body still felt exhausted.
 Rodregas must have moved enough to get some attention because a man, or to be more accurate, an adult male Nymph, moved into his sight.
 Rodregas was always surprised by the amount of hair coming out of the ears of an adult Nymph.
 He was glad that was one trait that Imeralda did not seem to have.
 He knew the thought to be a silly one even as it crossed his mind.

This one is for sleeplessness, this one for appetite stimulation, this one for back pain, and this one—believe it or not— is for asthma.
 It was absurd.
 I know there are people out there who claim they need this drug, but those people were not my son or half of the high school, nor did anyone at this dispensary seem to be suffering from anything but red squinty eyes.
 But, we thought, at least our son is only smoking legal pot.
 I did it, and I’m okay.
 As time went on Brandon was showing signs that he was faltering.
 I busted him again.
 Then, he began to collect speeding tickets, show up to work on the Chevelle apparently inebriated, fight with his brother, be non-participatory in the family.
 As I have freely admitted, I experimented with drugs in the seventies and the eighties and was no stranger to the signs of his drug use or the possibility of drug dealing.
 I knew all too well what could be ahead if he didn’t change his lifestyle.

We can call and order some tonight."
 "Call and order?"
 "Yeah--pizza places deliver to your house."
 "Really?"
 He smiled at her surprise, leaning over to wipe mustard from the corner of her mouth.
 "Really."
 It was nearly 4:00 before he could talk her into going home.
 She'd built a sand dragon with a group of people, and then both she and Rick had played volleyball.
 She claimed that she could keep going, but she fell asleep on the way home.
 They were too tired to do anything but watch TV that evening.

When he left for work, she'd exercise and watch movies he'd rented for her and clean the house with the supplies she'd discovered.
 In the evenings they'd eat and talk and watch TV, but he promised to take her to the shore Saturday.
 "The first thing we have to do is buy you a bathing suit," Rick told Marie as they strolled through the mall after dinner Friday evening.
 "Be prepared, OK?
 I think you'll find them a little immodest."
 She tried to prepare herself, but she was shocked by the outfits she was shown.
 The material was thin, and they all had plunging necklines, and some were cut so that the edge of the leg hole was almost as high as the arm hole.
 But she managed to find two, one red and one black with pink flowers, that were less shocking than the others and took them to the dressing room.
 These weren't going to work.
 She'd chosen the two with the least amount of décolletage, and they still wouldn't work.

Her grin didn't engender trust, but when I opened my mouth to call her on it, she forestalled me with an upraised hand.
 "I swear.
 We'll go home and leave the dress here."
 The pout came back out for a moment.
 "But, if you're not going to let me buy this for you, I'm going to need to compensate by buying something for Jasmin."
 Rachel flounced off, followed by a frowning Jasmin, leaving Dominic to help me out of the straitjacket I was currently using as a dress.
 Chapter 25 I slowly stretched, and then turned over and smiled when I found Alec lying on top of the covers.
 "Good morning, beautiful."
 As always, his voice sent shivers down my spine.
 By the time we'd arrived home, it was ridiculously late, and I'd barely managed to stay awake long enough to bolt down a little dinner after Donovan had helped us unload our haul.

She made herself stop running, certain that speed had nothing to do with going 84 years backwards.
 She began walking in the direction from which she'd come yesterday.
 Or from which she thought she'd come, anyway.
 How would she know if she'd gotten back?
 Surely she'd be able to recognize her own home.
 But what if she got back to 1927 but not to her house?
 She could go up to someone's house and ask .

“You have not earned it,” Dieredon said.
 He halted directly in front of the motionless man.
 Less than six feet separated them.
 “I have been watching you,” the man in black said.
 “I have dipped inside your dreams.
 You have seen me before, haven’t you?”
 “You were the necromancer that led the orcs against Veldaren.
 You helped them cross the bone ditch.”
 “Correct,” Velixar said, his smile visible beneath his hood.
 “It was a glorious day.

His chest was a mess of pain, his mind light and dizzy.
 As Velixar reached down, his maggoty face smiling and his hand dripping unholy magic, a wave of arrows rained upon him.
 Five buried into Velixar’s back.
 Six more found his legs and arms.
 He arched and shrieked as the blessed water seared his wretched body.
 Dieredon staggered to his feet, his bow still in his hands.
 The man in black reached around and tore out the arrows from his body.
 Still no blood flowed.
 “My name is Dieredon,” the elf gasped.
 “Know it before I send you to the abyss.”

“Emily will find out eventually, and when she does, she'll kill you for keeping a secret from her.” “Let's hope it isn't until you and I figure this thing out.” I nodded and walked back into the cave.
 Emily and Jason watched us enter and I swallowed nervously.
 Seth gave me a small nod, signaling me to start telling them about my dream.
 “Listen guys, I had a dream,” I said and repeated my dream again, minus the part about Seth.
 Emily and Jason listened to every word I said.
 When I got to the part about Kojas, Emily's mouth made a small O and Jason's eyes widened.
 My voice shook as I recalled the dwarf's dead body.
 “That's awful!” Emily said, her voice shaking.
 She hopped over and gave me a small embrace.
 “I'm sorry you had to see that.” “Uh...thanks Emily,” I said and allowed myself to be hugged.

Birds whistled, but no elven voice spoke back.
 “Aurelia!” he shouted again, wincing at the pain in his chest.
 After arriving in town, he had found one of his stashed healing potions and downed it.
 His ribs had gone from several pieces to just a single break, and his shoulder was slowly regaining strength.
 It would still be days before he was back to full health, days he did not have to spare.
 “I’m here,” Aurelia said after the third yell from Dieredon.
 The elf turned and smiled at her even though she winced and moved to examine his arm, which remained in a sling.
 “They are nothing,” he told her.
 “Please, you must listen to me.
 Stay away from the half-orcs.

All throughout Woodhaven rumbled the signal to retreat.
 He gave the signal two more times before clipping the horn back to his belt and hobbling north.

 [section break](break.png)
 Aurelia raced down the twisting back alleys of Celed.
 The dreaded chill of Velixar was far behind her, but still she hesitated to slow.
 Never before had she felt so vulnerable.
 As she stopped to catch her breath, a loud horn call echoed throughout the town.
 The elf sighed, clutching her staff to her chest as she slumped against the side of a house.
 The battle was over…‌but would the man in black obey the call?

I was approached and asked for my license, which, of course I showed.
 I was given the grand tour and a detailed break down of how each different bud worked better for different symptoms.
 This one is for sleeplessness, this one for appetite stimulation, this one for back pain, and this one—believe it or not— is for asthma.
 It was absurd.
 I know there are people out there who claim they need this drug, but those people were not my son or half of the high school, nor did anyone at this dispensary seem to be suffering from anything but red squinty eyes.
 But, we thought, at least our son is only smoking legal pot.
 I did it, and I’m okay.
 As time went on Brandon was showing signs that he was faltering.
 I busted him again.
 Then, he began to collect speeding tickets, show up to work on the Chevelle apparently inebriated, fight with his brother, be non-participatory in the family.

Everyone who was recognized for reaching a new level of their treatment was welcome to speak if they wished.
 Those who were in the program longer were more likely to do so, thanking others (both students and staff) for helping them through their most difficult challenges.
 Some were very emotional and some were humorous, all were heartfelt and meaningful descriptions of their individual challenges to reach that next level.
 It was clear that everyone here, whether they were staff or student, had the ability to impact anyone they touched.
 When the moment arrived for this evening’s three graduates to speak, a young lady in her early twenties walked to the front of the room with her head down.
 When she looked up, she smiled nervously.
 She had no family present.
 She told everyone how her mother told her how ugly she was her whole life and told her she was worthless, how she attempted to numb the pain with the drugs she took.
 How she became addicted to the drugs, and prostituted herself to pay for her habit.
 She said that she took all the drugs she could because she knew she would never be alive to see her twenty-first birthday.

They came forward to snarl, one regarding Ruby and one Steed, and I could only be glad it wasn’t me as their muzzles pulled back and exposed a vicious set of teeth, complete with meat-tearing fangs.
 The hair rose on their backs and I was suddenly positive they were larger than Ruby.
 A horrific growl ripped from their chests in unison and I cringed.
 Then, at once, they settled back into relaxed seated positions as if they had never been angry.
 “We also do not do tricks.” Yes, there was humor there.
 I was relieved to see the intimidating pair might not be as strict as I’d imagined.
 “We will return to watch.” They inclined their heads and walked out of the circle in unison, disappearing from view.
 I twisted the feather I was holding in my hand.
 How remarkable it must be to master a beast.
 I wouldn’t have to be battered during training then, I thought, and winced at the idea of Ruby cracking one of those wolf-dogs with her whip.

The warm family atmosphere was suddenly replaced by an awkwardness that was only relieved by a lively business discussion among the three men.
 Marie caught her mother's glance, and the two ladies went to the kitchen to get some pastries and coffee.
 "Don't worry, Marie--the two of you just need some time alone together to talk."
 "No."
 Marie shook her head.
 "I'm not going to marry him."
 "What?!"
 "I don't love him, Mother.
 I never did, really."
 She turned to look at her mother earnestly.

 LE:  	It’s alright, Love.
 BG: 	We were together about a year, I think.
 It lasted about a year.
 She was there when we recorded some of our first songs, I remember that.
 She loved, uh, “Hayley Mill’s Underpants.”  For some reason, she thought that was her song.
 Maybe because Carol was a young woman who loved lingerie.
 And, as a young man, who appreciated a young woman who loved lingerie, well, we had some fiery times.
 Hot as monkeys.
 She had these little white things…I don’t know where she got ‘em.

He did chuckle a bit as he said, “First, you want me to admit that I killed an Immortalist Sorcerer, and when I do, you don’t believe me.
 An old soldier like me just can’t win.” Van’dret was too smart not to pick up his hint, “An old soldier?” he asked very quietly.
 “My turn to ask a question,” said Rodregas.
 “How did you connect the three of us to these crimes?” Van’dret shrugged and smiled and said, “To be honest, I did not really think you were the ones.
 I simply did not like you, and the way you hung out with non-Celestials.
 It is unnatural.
 Now, it is my turn to ask a question.” “Actually,” interrupted Rodregas, “you already asked me about being an old soldier.
 Let me answer that first.
 I was a sergeant in Ravenhurr’s guard and I am afraid I have become what I learned to hate more than anything, an Immortalist.” Rodregas paused and took a deep breath.
 What he said next was hard even for himself to say, “In truth, I am an old man who had his time on this world and did not do much with it.

By the time Marie had washed her face and redone her make-up and brushed her hair, the hiccups were gone.
 Good.
 She could go kiss Rick.
 She smiled to herself, thinking about how sweet he was to her.
 Already she was feeling better about ending her betrothal to Davis.
 She wanted a man who would spend time with her and hold her and make her feel safe and cherished.
 A man like Rick.
 Tears filled her eyes yet again, and she snatched up a tissue to dab at them to keep from ruining her make-up.
 Rick loved her.
 And-and .

If Britney drove all the way out here and I was already gone because I'd taken the bus, she was going to be really mad.
 On the other hand, if she didn't show, I had no other way to get to school, and Mom would freak out.
 Part of the reason she felt like she could be gone so much ever since the accident was the fact that I always did the responsible thing.
 If she started thinking I was cutting class, she was going be furious.
 It would be like I was behaving irresponsibly and taking away her ability to pursue her art, all at the same time.
 It was past time for the bus to arrive, and she still wasn't here.
 A car zipped around the corner driving way too fast, just like Britney always did, but it wasn't white.
 I looked past it, hoping to see another one following it.
 My mouth nearly hit the ground when I recognized the throaty roar and dark paint job of Brandon's Mustang.
 "I knew you'd be sitting here worrying she wouldn't come."

 "I love you too.

 How soon can we get married?

 He laughed, setting her back to look at her.
 "We'll go inside and get it.
 But you have to tell me what happened.
 You wanted so badly to go home."
 He gazed down into her eyes.

He changed bodies so often that you always felt like you were meeting someone new, but it was not long before you realized that it was Korin.
 He wore a slim male body that was well-built, not much over 20 years old, with blue eyes and blond hair.
 Rodregas was not sure what to say to him so he stood there simply looking.
 He was the Master and it would not be surprising for Ravenhurr to keep him waiting for a few minutes.
 Korin waited patiently, seemingly at ease with what Rodregas would assume to be strange behavior by Master Ravenhurr.
 “Are you ready to leave and celebrate my new birth?”  Rodregas asked him.
 Adept Korin nodded politely and said, “Yes, Master, the gods favor your desire to imitate their celestial glory.” Rodregas nodded back in acknowledgement and said, “And have you found any new bodies who you would like to… take?” That question seemed to surprise him, but Korin smiled and said, “No, Master.
 I have been too busy working on my studies.” Korin now looked at him with a surprised expression and an eyebrow slightly raised.
 Rodregas wondered if he had said something wrong.
 While he had seen the two interact for some years, he really did not know what was appropriate for him to say in such a circumstance.

 "Thank you--sorry to have bothered you."
 Rick had to take Marie's arm and guide her back to the car.

If they are not given access to the information superhighways and other technological highways to progress, a new form of social and economic apartheid will spread, which will be even more serious in its consequences to the future of human civilization than the skin-colour-based apartheid which has just ended.
 True education is leadership in thought.
 There are periods in human history when the progress of decades can be accomplished in a few years.
 It is the view of the Commission that we have arrived at one of these great, creative moments.
 Can the political leadership of all countries seize this moment and convert it into an opportunity for promoting job-led economic growth, rooted in the principles of ecology and equity?
 Can we make the gender inequity and the coexistence of extreme poverty on the part of a billion children, women, and men, and extreme affluence and unsustainable lifestyles on the part of another billion, an anachronism of the past?
 Can we foster love of diversity and pluralism in terms of religion, race, language, colour or political belief?
 In our view, there are uncommon opportunities now to find the solutions to these basic challenges facing contemporary human society.
 We have tried to deal with them in a concise manner in this report, which concludes that commitment to the principles of democracy and human diversity, equity in terms of gender, economic condition and sustainable lifestyles, is fundamental to achieving both a better common present and a better future.
 Personally, it has been a privilege working with a highly distinguished group of women and men, whose sole concern has been a better life for all.

Go to it.
 Slaughter everyone without exception.”
 Harruq’s muscles screamed for use.
 He could barely register the request asked of him.
 All he could think of was wielding his swords in battle.
 “Which way do we go?” he asked.
 “I know the way,” Qurrah said, his eyes lingering on the whip curled about his right arm.
 “Their nightmares are crying out to me.
 You have prepared them, haven’t you master?”
 The man in black nodded.

There was nothing else I could do.
 I sighed, melting back into my own mind.
 It was quiet there and I wondered if I had cracked.
 But then it occurred to me that maybe I had been the cause of it.
 I was resigned now, the fury gone, and so was the screeching, the pain.
 They had said the binding was dangerous… There was a collective gasp as they realized I was back.
 I heard someone beside me and a flash of anger swept through me, lighting a flame at whoever it was.
 So maybe the fury wasn’t completely gone.
 I suddenly remembered the pages I had burnt in the briar patch so long ago.
 Burnt before I’d read them.

Having him touch me in other ways was pretty high on the list too, but maybe that was just psychosomatic.
 He didn't need to know that.
 I really did want to spend time with him.
 Even if he wasn't going to touch me, being with him was better than being anywhere else.
 "This is a mistake.
 The worst kind of mistake because we both know it's wrong and we don't care."
 "I don't think it's a mistake.
 I don't even think it is wrong."
 "But if you did, would you care?"
 "Probably not, but that doesn't change the fact that this is what I want to do."

“Your mother…” I trailed off.
 He sighed.
 “My mother died years ago, with a large part of the northern clans.” I cringed.
 His mother had died because of my mother.
 The same as Chevelle.
 I was almost afraid to ask.
 “And your father?” He smiled.
 “My father wanders the mountain… killing fairies.” My jaw dropped.
 “You mean Ruby is your sister?” “Half-sister,” he emphasized.
 He let me roll that around for a while before he spoke again.

 He loved her and desperately wanted to make love to her, and her response to him was passionate and unrestrained.

And to Qurrah.”
 “I would have it no other way,” Velixar said.
 A hand touched his forehead.
 All the anger that had raged inside Harruq roared like a fire suddenly loosed upon a dry forest.
 Sweat poured from his skin.
 His head jerked upward, his eyes soaking in the white of Velixar’s hand and the dim glow of the stars.
 Power flowed into him, his muscles stretching and tightening in a chaotic manner.
 “Rise, Harruq Tun,” Velixar said.
 “Revel in the power of Karak.”
 “By the gods, brother, if you could see yourself,” Qurrah said, his voice full of shock and wonder.

The prospect of trying to catch up, all the while needing to master new material and deal with a full schedule of other classes, was too much.
 I felt tears rising to the surface even as my heartbeat sped up to near-panic attack levels.
 That was the last thing I needed, but I could only fight off so many worries at once, and I was quickly approaching my limits.
 "Now don't come unglued on me.
 The school has set aside some discretionary funds for a math tutoring lab after school every day.
 We're not fully staffed yet, but if you swing by we should be able to help clear up any questions you might have.
 You'll have to do the majority of the work.
 I expect you to actually read your math book, but if you give it an honest effort I'm sure you'll be just fine."
 That helped a little.
 It was still a daunting prospect, but knowing I had somewhere to turn for help comforted me more than I would have expected.

“If you had been mine at the age of nine…‌ my previous apprentice Xelrak held but a shred of your strength.”
 Qurrah straightened at the name.
 “I have heard of Xelrak.
 He toppled the Citadel.”
 Velixar smiled as he remembered a cherished memory.
 “Indeed.
 It was his finest hour, and a significant victory for Karak.
 The paladins of Ashhur are all but crushed.”
 “What happened to him?”
 His burning eyes held no kindness when the man in black spoke.

“I know you felt they were not a danger, but to walk up and take the food from two Dire Cats?
 That is just asking to be killed.” Her voice was unusually high pitched and she was shaking her head in disbelief.
 “The Dire Bear must have been living in the cellar,” said Doi’van.
 “I bet they actually had to go in and kill it there.
 We probably did not hear the battle because it was underground.
 They probably dragged it out after.
 It is said that Dire meat makes you strong.
 Not sure if that is true though.” His voice, in contrast to Imeralda’s, sounded completely normal.
 “Don’t you care that he did something so stupid?” asked Imeralda.
 “Well,” Doi’van replied slowly, “the cats are obviously connected to him due to his Celestial lion essence.

The elven blade whirled, cutting two out of the air.
 The third smacked into his throat.
 Luckily, the bone was part of a finger and lacked a sharp enough edge to cut skin.
 Instead, the elf was left gasping as he retreated from another series of strikes from Harruq.
 “Pretenders, are we?” Qurrah asked as his fingers performed a dark weave.
 “How much I wish for your pride to suffer.” Magical energy rippled out of him and tore across the air.
 The elf whirled, sensing the incoming invisible blow.
 Only a tiny part hit his shoulder, immediately encasing it in ice.
 Then Harruq was upon him, slashing recklessly.
 Ahrqur batted his sword left and right, then jumped as Harruq swung back in a scissor-cut that should have shredded his waist.

His shoulders hunched, and his head lowered as a reluctant bit of shame stung his words.
 “The blood of both elves and orcs fills my veins.”
 He expected to be scoffed, mocked, or banished.
 Instead, Velixar laughed.
 “Such blasphemy against the elven goddess,” he said.
 “Appropriate, so appropriate.
 You have sworn your life to me, half-orc.
 You should learn what you stand to gain.”
 The cloaked man reached across the fire.
 His fingers brushed Qurrah’s pale face.

 “Why?” she asked, her voice curious on his repeated questioning.
 “Because I am wondering if our ‘Paladin’ has a connection to the Dire Cats.
 I know a Celestial lion was used in the ceremony and whoever our Paladin is I assume he now has it’s essence, and those two were taken as the Celestial’s mates.”  Imeralda and Doi’van looked at him, and then she slowly added, “And what was one of your first actions?
 You freed them from the dungeon.
 Dire Cats are smarter than regular lions; they might see you as an ally or part of their herd.
 No wait, I think with cats you call them prides.
 But I wonder how they see Doi’van and me?” she asked.
 Neither Doi’van nor Rodregas had an answer to that question.
 “Well,” Rodregas said, “we need to find shelter and if they meant us harm us they would not have shown themselves.

The two journeyed across the hills and then snuck inside Woodhaven.
 When they reached their home, Harruq removed his armor and began wrapping strips of old cloth around his wounds.
 Qurrah watched him for a moment before speaking.
 “You know what you must do, should it come to it,” he said.
 Harruq nodded, knowing exactly what he meant.
 “Don’t have much of a choice, do I?”
 He wrapped a long piece of cloth around his chest and then struggled to make his beefy hands tie a firm knot behind his back.
 Qurrah crossed the room, silent.
 He took the bits from Harruq’s hands and tied them in a double knot.
 “Do your best to convince Aurelia not to fight,” he said, his voice quieter than normal.

No buildings or monuments marked it, just a single circle of grass upon which no house would ever be built.
 On that spot, Singhelm the Strong and Ceredon Sinistel, leaders of Neldar’s troops and the Erzen elves, respectively, had made a pact that a city could exist between the two races without bloodshed.
 Singhelm had long since passed away, while Ceredon remained, two hundred years older, as the leader of the elven elite Ekreissar.
 It was in that clearing Antonil halted his army.
 The men shuffled around nervously, their eyes searching for enemies that always seemed to be hiding beyond their vision.
 The guard captain unrolled the edict, his gut sinking as he realized where he stood.
 Long ago, man and elf had agreed to live together in peace.
 Now, on that very same spot, he would rescind that agreement.
 Beyond the clearing loomed several palisades.
 All nearby windows were closed, and several boarded.

Two-thirds of the UK workforce have no vocational or professional qualification, compared with only 25 per cent in Germany.
 There is growing support in the United States for establishment of a national youth apprenticeship training programme that combines classroom schooling with on-the-job skills training to ensure a smooth transition to employment for those who do not pursue higher education.
 11.Link demilitarization to urban employment: The military possesses both the expertise and the physical infrastructure for training large numbers of people in a wide range of technical, vocational and social skills.
 Building upon success ful US Defence Department programmes that re-deploy soldiers to assist troubled inner city youth, closed military bases can be converted into large training centres operated by military teaching staff for instructing and housing urban unemployed youth during an apprenticeship period.
 12.Promote integrated urban development programmes: The Atlanta Project is a bold attempt to evolve a new type of organization to address the problems of inner city poverty and unemployment.
 The inner city of Atlanta, Georgia, has been divided into clusters in which members of the local community work closely with the staff of major corporations, voluntary agencies, religious groups and a wide range of government agencies to identify and promote employment opportunities and other poverty-alleviation activities.
 13.Promote organizational innovation: In recent years, large firms have made significant strides in improving their speed, efficiency and flexibility of response to changing market conditions by restructuring operations into independent companies and autonomous profit-centres.
 Small firms need to develop new types of organizations to help them acquire some of the benefits of larger size.
 An innovative experiment has been launched by two dozen small precision-manufacturing, defence contractors in the state of Kansas, with the support of the US Defence Department, to combine their technical, organizational and marketing resources for diversification into non-defence production.
 Initiatives of this type can help strengthen the 12,000 small tool and die-making companies in the United States as well as millions of other small companies in other industries and other countries.

Perhaps not, she wondered.
 Perhaps she saw the elf in Harruq while Dieredon saw the orc.
 The kindest man might become a brute when surrounded by other brutes.
 When Harruq was with his brother, or the strange man in black, how then did he behave?
 Could he kill?
 Could he murder?
 She had to know.
 It took a simple invisibility spell to approach their rundown home unnoticed, her feet moving silently because of her natural elven grace.
 It was midday and the sun was high in the sky.
 Most of the murders occurred once darkness fell, and always when the child wandered into the forest to play.

"Who's Donovan?"
 Another chuckle.
 "That's one of the most difficult questions you've asked so far.
 He likes to call himself our butler, but that doesn't even begin to describe him.
 He does take care of most of the duties a typical butler would assume, but he's also our financial manager and long-time family friend.
 I'm excited for you to meet him tomorrow.
 I think you'll like him."
 "Yeah, but will he like me?"
 I sat up in bed, excited to finally be getting real details about Alec's life.
 "Please lie back down.

“Do you remember The Lion?” asked Imeralda.
 “What?” Rodregas asked.
 He sounded as confused as he felt.
 “The Celestial Lion.
 Do you remember him?
 The way he walked; the way he moved,” she said.
 “Of course,” he said.
 No one could forget seeing a Celestial animal of any kind much less a lion.
 “You know the great beasts of the Celestial Realm are not just magical animals.
 They are more.

“The person you’ve been sneaking off to each night?” he asked.
 “You know?” Qurrah asked.
 “Course,” he said, shrugging.
 “You’re sneaky, brother, but I’m not as deep a sleeper as you think I am.
 So who is this person?”
 Qurrah bit his lower lip.
 “His name is…‌he will tell you his name.
 He is powerful, Harruq.
 Very powerful.
 I’ve taken him as my teacher, and I want him to become yours as well.”

Britney wasn't one of them.
 I caught her glaring at me a couple of times out of the corner of my eye.
 Under normal circumstances I probably would've felt guilty, or at least wished things had worked out differently.
 Today, I was fully prepared to acknowledge Britney as the spoiled, self-centered brat she was.
 The bell rang and then Mrs. Campbell's lecture was over in record time.
 I even finished my assignment a good ten minutes before class was scheduled to end.
 I was absently sketching what I expected the inside of the opera house to look like, when a tap on my shoulder pulled me out of my reverie.
 "I'm so sorry, Mrs. Campbell.
 I finished early, but I should have started on one of the catch-up assignments.
 I just didn't want to get into a whole new subject with only ten minutes left."

I didn’t see a peak—didn’t even know if we were going to the peak of the mountain we were on—but I was too cowardly to ask, to think about what had happened, so I distracted myself in the journal.
 My sister hasn’t spoken to me since our mother passed.
 I wish she was… different.
 Not merely a different personality, but different altogether.
 I can remember the stories in my mother’s journal about her own sister.
 They were so close.
 That was, of course, until my father.
 But I suppose my sister might be different as well, if not for him.
 He’s taking a journey, they tell me.
 He’ll be gone a long time.

What is the responsibility of the international community for preventing or alleviating crises within societies?
 What should be the limits placed on international involvement in the internal affairs of countries that, at least momentarily, are unable to help themselves?
 The sanctity of the sovereign state, like the sanctity of private property in a capitalist society, is a fundamental principle of the nation state system on which the present world community is based.
 Like the protectors of private property, the guardians of the sovereign state vigorously resist each attempt to limit its scope or qualify its power – although in both instances there are obvious and well-recognized limits and qualifications.
 The sensitivity over the issue of sovereignty – especially among former colonies and victims of imperialist aggression – is quite understandable in view of the fact that the emergence of modern nation states over the last two centuries occurred during a period when imperialist wars and colonial conquests were accepted as part of the normal conduct of international relations.
 It is a measure of the world’s progress in this century that this standard of conduct is no longer tolerated by the international community.
 The formulation of current policy on racial memories of past exploitation or persecution is no more appropriate or conducive to human progress, however, than the false conception of policies based on an exaggerated sense of pride or egocentric self-importance derived from the glory of forceful conquest in the past.
 In both instances, attitudes of the past must give way to fresh attitudes oriented to the future.
 Some member states are understandably wary of raising these issues, out of concern that their re-examination could become an excuse for outright political interference in the internal affairs of sovereign nations, a concern which is reinforced by the non-representative character and lack of impartiality of the Security Council.
 Other nations are reluctant to assume the greater responsibilities that a clearly enunciated doctrine might impose on them.

Sometimes the fact that he was a shape shifter instead of just a normal boy was pretty inconvenient.
 Of course if he wasn't a shape shifter, then he wouldn't really be Alec.
 "Your mom is likely to be back in town pretty soon.
 Her latest contract has about run its course and it's looking like I'd have to throw a whole bunch of money at her if I wanted to keep her in Europe."
 "I'm not so sure that's really an improvement in topics."
 "You don't want to see your mom?"
 "It's not that, it's just that I know we're not going to be able to spend as much time together.
 It's not like she's going to let me sleep over."
 Alec shrugged.
 "I can arrange for her to stay away for another month or two, but with the kind of disposable income she'd get out of the deal it's very possible she'll fly you out there."

Not even met.
 Stared at.
 Heat crept into my cheeks for no good reason, and I picked up my pace to the old tree that housed the library.
 I knew my shoulders were drawn in and I was glancing around too often, but I couldn’t seem to help it.
 It felt illicit.
 Twice I imagined a set of dark eyes on me, a pricking sensation running over my spine.
 I was going to have to pull myself together.
 I was being ridiculous.
 At this rate, I’d be fawning and flipping my hair like Evelyn by sundown.
 When I finally walked into the library, I remembered why I didn’t go there to study lineages.

And even as he half fell backwards he used the momentum to slide down and try to land a blow low under the shield.
 Rodregas had both quickness and strength on his side.
 He blocked the blow with his sword and then bashed down quick and hard multiple times with his shield.
 He thought he heard a bone break.
 Rodregas paused and the knight signaled him as victor with a finger to the Heavens.
 Rodregas followed this pattern throughout the day.
 He kept using his sword more to block than to attack and kept using his shield offensively.
 This allowed him to take advantage of his unnatural strength to overwhelm his foes.
 According to the contest rules, he could replace his shield after every fourth match if need be.
 By the final match, he was on his third and final shield.

Her voice was scratchy, and her eyes were red from crying, but she was putting on a brave face, and Rachel didn't even hesitate.
 "Of course, Jess.
 We figured you wanted some privacy with Isaac, or we would've dragged you over here hours ago."
 The rest of us were quick to pipe in, but at least on my side, the sentiment was a little half-hearted.
 Unlike Jasmin, Jessica never had come around, never made her peace with the fact that because of me things were going to go downhill in a hurry after tonight.
 I'd tried to get both Rachel and Dominic to explain why she hated me so much, but neither would give me a real explanation.
 Rachel would always just get mad and say there was no excuse for how Jess was acting.
 Dominic always refused to say anything other than that Jessica had been through her own set of struggles, and had her reasons for her behavior.
 "I'll be done with Dom in just a moment, Jess, then I'll fix your hair while Rachel finishes up with Adri."
 The nickname should have hurt, but somehow it wasn't as bad when the pack used it.

My white gown spread around me in the water, now-dark hair swaying with the ripples on the surface.
 I rose above, peering down at myself, and the image turned into my mother, the dark water going black, the ripples transforming to wind.
 I recognized the scene as her pendant began to glow, the wind howling, screams piercing my ears.
 It was the same dream, but different now.
 I glanced around to find a village I didn’t know.
 Someone was coming toward me, an expression of fear and sadness on his handsome face.
 His familiar face.
 He reached out to me and I stepped toward him, tears streaming down my cheeks.
 He wrapped his arms around me as I turned again to see my mother.
 A howl of rage escaped her and I started to go to her, but he held me.

I managed to put the impending drawing more or less out of my mind for the first half of the day, but I actually missed Britney's constant gossip.
 There was almost no redeeming value to most of what she said, but it did have the benefit of being distracting.
 By the time lunch finally came around I needed some kind of distraction.
 This was my only chance to see Les Misérables performed live before I turned forty.
 Unfortunately, while the conversation at Brandon's table was plentiful, it wasn't very distracting.
 I was quickly realizing that Brandon's friends weren't very nice.
 I'd pretty much known Cassie was a wench, but Vincent seemed even meaner.
 While a story about how someone tricked some poor girl into thinking he was going to ask her out was highly illuminating, it wasn't particularly the kind of thing I wanted to dwell on.
 Especially considering how many parallels there were between her story, and mine.
 I kept looking at the clock, and the later it got, the more certain I was that Principal Gossil was just about to get on the loudspeaker and call out the winners of the drawing.

He wasn't a regular at the tutor lab, and didn't have the hectic, desperate look of someone cramming for a test.
 Instead he looked completely at ease sitting in one of the no-man's-land tables with a pair of books open in front of him.
 By the looks of things he wasn't going to need any help.
 Once it was just the four of us, Britney waved me over and held up her homework.
 "I don't get it.
 What is the answer to this one?"
 I shook my head in exasperation.
 "Me telling you the answers won't help you on the test.
 If you have a specific question about how to work a problem I'd be more than happy to help you, but I'm not going to do your homework for you."
 Britney looked like she had all kinds of things that she'd like to say, but she showed more restraint that I'd realized she was capable of, and kept them all inside.

 “A wish gladly granted,” Aurelia said, a tiny smile finally cracking free.

 I doubt either will gladly accept us.”
 “I have never been to Veldaren,” Aurelia said.
 “Although I have heard it is beautiful, in its own way.
 I can get us inside, if all you fear are the gate guards.

Was this why council was so quick to accuse me of practicing dark magic?
 It was rarely even discussed and never tolerated.
 What had Fannie done?
 I flipped through more of the pages, realizing something was out of place.
 It didn’t make sense official documents about Fannie would be among those relating to the apparent extinction of the northern clans.
 And why had all the documents I’d found about the tragedy been separated, mixed up, and missing pages?
 I tried to sort it out, but found there were other council documents there too.
 I kept reading, quickly scanning for something of interest.
 My eyes caught on his name a second before my mind recognized it… Chevelle Vattier.
 As I backed up to read, my shock and disbelief turned to fury before I could even finish the page.

 I couldn’t decide whether to run, whether to fight.

 I couldn’t bring myself to look away from him, but I saw Rune standing in my peripheral vision.
 I was caught.
 I frantically searched for some explanation.

 He flipped his arm, dismissing me.

Liz – I don’t know, it just seems that in movies, when a character’s parent meets another person or gets married the character is always against it.
 And then they usually seem to come up with a scheme to get their parents back together.
 Jim – A scheme to get mom and dad back together, I never thought of that…hmmm, that actually wouldn’t be a bad idea.
 Liz – Are you serious?
 Jim – Hell no I’m not serious.
 Mom’s leaving was the best thing that could have ever happened to our family, I’m glad to be rid of her.
 Liz – Will Johnny feel the same way?
 Jim – Johnny hates mom.
 I don’t know how he’ll take dad’s new love interest.
 Oh damn, I still have to tell him about Gene.

By the time I'd returned, Rachel's youthful features had taken on a mature cast that'd make all kinds of boys wish they'd taken a risk and asked Alec's little sister out.
 Jasmin had about the least reason out of any girl alive to be an expert hair dresser since her naturally wavy hair could just air dry and still look like she'd spent hours working on it, but an expert she was.
 The results of her efforts on Rachel's behalf were nothing less than spectacular, and the casual-looking knot of curls and twists was wispy in all the right places.
 Even with Rachel currently an order of magnitude hotter than normal, Jasmin still captured the prize.
 Rachel's work on her behalf had resulted in a makeup job that was so incredibly understated, even us girls had a hard time detecting it.
 Her wavy brunette hair had been straightened and pulled back in what looked like an attempt to let some other girls shine for a change, but it just made her look like a goddess who'd decided to spend the night slumming.
 Given who she'd spent the last hour being surrounded by, it was no wonder Dominic was worried she was the ugly step sister.
 She needn't have worried.
 Her features were even more exotic than Jasmin's, and Rachel had chosen bright colors that made her stand out much more than usual.
 James' macho cool really was going to finally crack tonight.

The guard, with the speed of his sigil, blocked it.
 But he blocked it sword to sword instead of using the momentum and speed to simply guide the sword away from his body.
 The resulting blow had an unpleasant sound and cut right through Doi’van’s sword.
 Unfortunately for the guard, Doi’van stepped forward as he swung and jammed the lower half of the sword into his opponent’s chest.
 The guard flew into the bushes with a sickening crunching sound.
 Rodregas next heard the sound of another of the enemy and spun into the sound using all his speed and strength, hoping to take a guard with either advantage.
 His target proved to be a slaver.
 He had a ragged beard and held a small battle axe.
 Rodregas’ sword blow was too fast for the guard to block and had the strength to stun a guard wearing regulation armor.
 His sword cleaved the guard in half, and a gout of blood and gore splattered him.

 And why the hell was I the last person on the planet to find out?
 Johnny – I think it’s because you ate lead paint as a child.
 Eugene – I’d have to agree with Johnny, lead paint isn’t good for you.
 Jim – You knew that Elizabeth felt something for me, and you didn’t say anything, what kind of friend are you?
 Johnny – Maybe he’s Elizabeth’s friend more than he’s your friend.
 If that’s the case he might have wanted to spare her from a lifetime of living with you.

Aurelia fell for the feint and brought her staff up high, leaving her lower half exposed.
 Her slender frame twisted.
 A sword cut a thin line across the green fabric of her dress but did not touch skin.
 She thought Harruq might stop and claim the cut counted.
 He didn’t.
 Instead he crosscut, his left arm swiping right while the other swept left.
 She turned to one side, using her staff to press one sword into the dirt and knock the second swipe just above her.
 The staff continued twirling, positioning Harruq’s hands further out of place.
 She used the awkwardness to gain further separation between them.
 Her hands ached from the force of every block and parry.

 Crap!
 I stubbed my toe on a root, one of the pitfalls of living in a tree.
 It throbbed and I slammed the door in frustration as I left the tree.

Liz – It would cost too much money.
 Jim – We could hold a fund raiser.
 Johnny – Is that the best you can come up with?
 Jim – What’s wrong with the idea?
 Liz – Think long and hard for a minute about all the people Gene has pissed off over the years.
 How many of them do you think would donate money to help him out.
 Jim – Point made.
 Well isn’t there some sort of loophole we can take advantage of?
 Liz – We looked.
 The only thing that comes close is a clause that makes the whole argument null and void if Eugene’s father dies.

I've only met her the one time.
 She seemed normal enough.
 I guess a little distracted..." The chuckle I'd been waiting for surfaced, but it wasn't at all like his normal laugh.
 It was as if someone had sucked all of the joy and goodness out of the sound I'd grown to crave on a nearly subconscious level, and left a twisted shell.
 "She's definitely distracted.
 You could even say utterly disconnected from the world.
 Completely free from the present, always living in the past."
 "I don't understand how any of this ties together."
 He looked up at me for the first time, and the tortured look in his eyes made me hold onto his hand as tightly as I was able.
 "It's all the same thing.

Jim – But how much was well spent?
 Eugene – Ten dollars.
 Johnny – How long did you play for?
 Eugene – I wasn’t playing.
 I was training.
 It was hard work.
 Jim – How long did you play for?
 Eugene – Twenty minutes.
 Johnny – You blew through all ten dollars in just twenty minutes?
 Eugene – What do you mean blew through?

I felt my eyes go big.
 "You mean to tell me that seventy percent of the school parties for three nights running every month?"
 Britney nodded.
 "It's the only redeeming feature to this stupid little town, and I can't even go since the accident..." I could see her trying to figure out how to sidestep the issue, but I wasn't about to let her off the hook.
 "Listen, if there's something dangerous around here don't you think I should know about it?"
 She shifted uncomfortably from one foot to another, eyes glancing to each side of us in an effort to see who might overhear us.
 "We can't talk about it here; you'll have to trust me.
 Wait until lunch."
 I wasn't entirely satisfied, but nodded, and followed her to algebra.
 Mrs. Campbell shot us both a glance that didn't bode well for any attempt to get out of class without a stern reprimand, but allowed us to go to our respective seats without comment.

It seemed amazing to me that they were willing to move so quickly around normal, uninformed humans, but apparently they figured professional dancers were at least as quick.
 I shook my head and turned back to Rachel, only to feel my throat constrict as I saw Britney.
 Not only was she wearing a tight, black dress that made her look at least twice as hot as me, she also happened to be draped across Brandon's arm.
 I was so caught up watching Britney that it took me several seconds to notice the differences in her date.
 Brandon had always exuded a sense of confidence, but sometime since I'd last seen him, it had morphed into something even more aggressive.
 He still cut through crowds, but people weren't moving out of his way out of deference anymore.
 Instead they were dodging away to avoid being run over.
 I felt the fine hair on the back of my neck stand on end, but was distracted by Alec's return before I could figure out what else had changed about Brandon.
 Jasmin pulled Rachel to her feet, and gently pushed her towards Alec before casually taking a seat next to me.
 It was a careful act.

I wiped her eyes and they came open, an unbelievable shade of dark green, sparkling like emeralds.
 She was a beauty.
 I wasn’t aware the room had grown silent until I wiped her ears and heard my own gasp.
 They were slightly rounded at the tips… almost blunt.
 I realized I had stopped breathing as I read, so engrossed in the story.
 I reached up absentmindedly to stroke the tops of my ears.
 I looked up then, at the elders who surrounded me.
 Their faces were astonished.
 “She is… human,” they said.
 I took a steadying breath and spat out, “No.” They stared at me, incredulous.

They'd stopped howling, but I could still hear them.
 I somehow found myself on my back again, looking up at the biggest wolf I'd ever seen.
 TV had given me the impression that a wolf shouldn't be much bigger than a German Shepherd.
 These guys were roughly the size of a small pony, one nearly black, the other more of a gray color, both with yellowish eyes, and lips pulled back to show teeth the size of my fingers.
 Most of my jeans had been torn away from my right calf, which was bleeding fairly profusely, but I didn't feel any pain.
 It was like my mind had finally torn loose from the moorings that usually held it in contact with reality.
 I was going to die, ripped to shreds by the same impossible animals that had killed the hikers a few months ago, but I just couldn't bring myself to care.
 Nobody would even miss me.
 The black wolf was inching towards me now, growling low in its throat.
 I could see its haunches tense up, and then it was airborne, hurtling towards me almost faster than I could follow.

It’s always best quit while you’re behind, but still not in dead last.
 Liz – What makes you think I would let you off that easy?
 Jim – Um, because it’s almost dinner time and you’re hungry?
 Karen – Hi Elizabeth!
 Liz – Hi Karen!
 (Liz and Karen hug in greeting)
 Liz – I am hungry.
 We’ll talk about this later.
 Jim – Damn.
 Last time I make that joke.

 He smiled.
 "I'd start wrapping work up at 4:30, and at 5:00 I'd be out the door.
 In fact, if you're still around tomorrow afternoon, I'll probably be home by 5:30."
 "Why?"

Eugene – I only said ‘My name is Godzilla’.
 Liz – And they laughed?
 Eugene – They laughed.
 Jim – Did you use a funny voice?
 Like the one you made that time you caught yourself in your…
 Eugene – I said it in a plain voice.
 And they laughed.
 Liz – Oh, poor Gene.
 Jim – At least they didn’t chase you off the bus, or hurt you.
 Eugene – I did manage to make some cash, so it’s not a complete loss.

I chose.
 “Of North Camber.” It must have been the right answer, because he grabbed me, exultant, sighing and kissing my skin.
 He held me with a fierceness, a gentleness, that took my breath.
 His lips trailed my cheeks, murmuring words and careful of wounds as they swept to a temple, my eyelid, the corner of my mouth.
 He lingered there, unable to resist touching the broken skin of my lips, even if it were only feather light, the barest brush of skin.
 He drew away slowly, feeling my shock, or seeing it in my eyes, and realizing his mistake.
 His expression fell, but he didn’t take his hands away.
 He swallowed hard, waiting for my confirmation.
 But I wasn’t the other Elfreda, not the long list of binding words that had been my identity for so long.
 I couldn’t seem to reconcile the two lives.

“I need something to draw with.” Ruby pulled a piece of charcoal and scrap of paper from her bags.
 I rushed to sketch the path I remembered from my dream, focusing on the ring of trees with the most detail.
 “They are there.” The men stood, motionless and staring until Anvil crossed the room to retrieve the map.
 He bowed a little as he took the paper from my hands and then hurried out, Grey following.
 Chevelle stayed.
 Ruby turned to him and breathed a deep sigh but he didn’t respond.
 My head throbbed and I groaned as I pressed the bridge of my nose.
 He was beside me in a flash, unspeaking.
 Ruby handed me another drink.
 It helped, but I was still irritated about the binding.

He kept whispering, his eyes wide.
 The meat floated from his hands and then lowered into the fire.
 Qurrah twirled his finger, and the slab turned as if on a spit.
 “We’re eating fancy tonight,” Harruq said, tossing the pot back to its corner.
 His stomach growled as the aroma of cooked meat filled his nostrils.
 “Glad you approve,” Qurrah said.
 They ate in silence until only bones remained, which Qurrah then tucked away in a pouch.
 Harruq relaxed and enjoyed the heat while his brother tightened his robe and leaned toward the fire.
 “Things are more dangerous now, aren’t they?” Harruq asked after a pause.
 Qurrah nodded, his thoughts distant.

“Good.
 The story of this world’s gods is not lengthy, nor complicated, but it is a story that you must learn.
 “Celestia created the rock, the grass, and the water.
 Her hand formed the wildlife, and to tend her creation she created elves.
 The goddess gave them long life and abundant land so quarrels within their race were of the petty sort.
 Then the brother gods came.
 Ashhur of Justice, Karak of Order.
 There are many worlds beyond our own, Qurrah.
 I have seen fleeting glimpses of them in my dreams.
 Karak and Ashhur came from one of those worlds, and Celestia welcomed them.

"You're welcome."
 He gazed into her eyes.
 "Marie, I'd never intentionally do anything to hurt you."
 "I know that.
 It isn't your fault."
 He frowned.
 "What isn't my fault?"
 She blushed.
 That your kisses make me hot, she thought.
 That your warmth and tenderness and thoughtfulness have made me dissatisfied with the man I'm supposed to marry.

"No.
 You know it isn't ready.
 I'll tell you when I've perfected it.
 Yes, you can bring Rachel, but I can't let anyone listen to it before it's ready."
 Alec bowed his head in acquiescence, grasping my hand as he turned to leave.
 His mother grabbed his arm before he could complete the motion.
 He halted instantly, despite there being no way she was strong enough to stop him.
 I doubted she had enough grip strength to slow even me down.
 "Don't be angry with me, Alec.
 You're all I have left."

She must have filled him in on my problem.
 I resisted the urge to touch him.
 I always wanted to touch him.
 “Frey,” Chevelle began in a measured tone.
 I cut him off, trying to sound calm.
 “What happened?” “It would seem the council has attacked us.” I was too numb to draw in the quick breath I expected.
 My cheeks tingled.
 I didn’t think I could feel my hands.
 “Attacked you,” he clarified.
 Something came out of my chest that sounded like a moan.

“Mother was an orc who had lived here in Woodhaven.
 I do not know her name, other than what she instructed my brother and I to call her: Mama Tun.
 Our father was from Woodhaven, she told us.
 We later found out he was an elf, bizarre as it seems.”
 “It is a wretched elf who would mate with an orc,” Velixar said.
 “No true elf would,” Qurrah said.
 “This means he was weak to have done so.
 His weakness has seeped into my blood.”
 “You hold no weakness,” the man in black said.
 “The blood of orcs and elves is more similar than either race would care to admit.

"We'll get one of the next size too."
 "May I help you?"
 Both Rick and Marie turned to the salesgirl.
 "We'd like to see some casual shirts for her," he said.
 "OK--we have some really pretty ones that just came in."
 She led them to a rack.
 "There are some more in the corner over there."
 She smiled at Marie.
 "Cute dress."
 Marie glanced down at her dress before responding with a puzzled, "Thank you."

“The founders were,” she says.
 We talk about the college, which she had loved.
 Then her friend joins us.
 She too is small, attractive and friendly.
 I’ll call her Sweet (since Sweety or Sweetheart might sound demeaning).
 She too attended George Fox.
 Our talk drifts from the varieties of modern Quakers to the benefits and hazards of churches in general.
 That last topic becomes the lead-in to her story.
 No sooner has she begun the telling, than Curly wanders off.
 Later I'll notice her on a couch close by, reading a book, or maybe pretending while she keeps watch over her friend, who no doubt is considered wacky by many, for reasons her story will clarify.

I think about standing outside the basketball gym a month before his last day, when Eric could easily have run like he insisted Billy and I do.
 But he said “I’m going to stay and take my punishment.” “For what?” I asked, and he didn’t answer.
 For what?
 I still want to know.
 A favorite mystery writer of mine, Ross McDonald, earned this praise from a reviewer: “McDonald doesn’t write about crime.
 He writes about sin.” I think back to the day I spent asking kids whether they often felt guilty about something but had no idea what it was.
 Though I didn’t understand at the time, I was asking if they felt the darkness in their nature, the affinity for sin.
 Somewhere, I read, "All sin is the result of the failure to love."
 Over lots of years, I have noted voluminous evidence for that idea, and not a shred against it.
 My last summer in Chico, I was sorely depressed, living too far from my family and confused about most everything.

You know, when I was young, when I was in Black Lung, I mean, it went so fast, everything was happening so fast, them calling me the next Clapton and shit like that.
 I was locked out of my feelings—they could have said anything about me back then.
 I didn’t care.
 Plus I was high half the time, all the time.
 People giving me poppers to take I didn’t even know what it was.
 I didn’t give a shit about anything.
 Just show me the way to the next whiskey bar, you know?
 Just show me the way to the next little girl.
 Now, with Lorelei, with what I’m saying now, it’s more personal, it’s what I care about.
 I’m hurt.

Peace-building activities should address underlying economic and social factors that prevent the establishment of a stable and secure peace.
 In instances such as Cambodia, Rwanda and Somalia, the vacuum created by the complete collapse of political and economic institutions necessitates a broader role for the UN in re-establishing the peace.
 Peace building has thus far been defined as post-conflict actions to support reconstruction and to strengthen and solidify peace.
 The concept needs to be broadened to include pre-conflict actions and expanded to encompass a wider array of potentially destabilizing factors that lead to conflicts.
 The Commission supports the establishment of an International Centre jointly operated by the UN Security Council and UNESCO to implement peace-building programmes.
 Peace-building activities should be expanded to address security threats issuing from environmental degradation, poverty, migration of population and refugees.
 Many cases of ethnic conflict have an under lying basis of economic deprivation that must be addressed before tensions will permanently subside.
 Others can be mitigated by the introduction of positive economic incentives for cooperation.
 Economic cooperation is already dissipating ethnic tensions and conflict in the Middle East.
 It can be creatively fostered in the Balkans and elsewhere.

He had not remembered the point system but he knew well that a knight is unique for his mastering of five different fighting styles.
 Doi’van continued, “The first they call ‘open fist’ which does not really make any sense to me, but it is barehanded with no armor.
 I think you are likely to do very well with that one.
 In fact, I think you would be wise to finish one of the top winners.
 The next is the bow…,” Doi’van glancing at Imeralda.
 Rodregas could not help but smile, “I know you guys think of my skill with the bow in terms of my inability to use the Black Yew bows.
 But really, I can shoot a bow with skill.” Doi’van and Imeralda looked at him doubtfully.
 “The challenge,” said Doi’van, “is not to be simply good but to be able to outshoot over one hundred other highly skilled warriors, and the targets are multiple and difficult including a moving target.
 Unfortunately, all the targets are within normal range for a human, your strength will not help.
 The good news is this is a competition of skill and they provide the bows.

 I just hope whatever it was turns out not to be as bad as she thought it was."
 Britney rolled her eyes.

I held my hand out and flicked a flame above my palm, then promptly extinguished it.
 I tried moving a stone from the ground to no avail.
 Just fire.
 I sighed.
 But Ruby looked hopeful.
 The group approached warily, keeping their eyes on me.
 Chevelle hung farther back, avoiding my gaze as he hovered near the edge of the mist.
 Steed led my horse to me.
 I didn’t think I blamed him—he seemed to be involved by chance—but I hadn’t fully decided yet.
 As we rode wordlessly through the cold stone landscape, my thoughts twisted and writhed as if a pit of vipers.

But conversation had become easy as soon as I had spoken that first word, as soon as I had said his name and he’d smiled in return.
 I found myself leaning toward him as he spoke, actually paying attention in places; he had a pleasant voice and an unusual dialect.
 He wove histories as if they were stories of his childhood friends instead of useless facts, and I became enthralled.
 It felt as if we were alone there in the quiet corner of the third level, the occasional murmur below and whisper of flipping pages the only other sound in the dim setting.
 A small knothole made a window in the wall across from me and some light from the cloudy day occasionally came through, putting Chevelle’s face in shade.
 I had been right; his eyes appeared nearly black in the shadows.
 I leaned forward, listening to him as a small gray bird landed on the lip of the knothole.
 “Cheep.” Not many animals feared the elves.
 It even seemed curious as to what we were doing.
 “Cheep, cheep.” I winced at the annoying chirps, working to focus on Chevelle’s story.

 Art – Nothing of the sort, these are pretty simple.
 First, I want you to stay out of trouble.
 No evil schemes or taking over the world and so forth, either go back to school or come work for me, which ever works best for you, just keep your nose clean.

He knew she was extremely attracted to him.
 Her response to him this afternoon had been passionate and unrestrained.
 And now he knew that when she'd said that she couldn't do it, she hadn't been talking about making love with him but about marrying Davis.
 And if he made love to her, she'd feel tied to him and be more likely to stay.
 If he slowly increased the heat of his kisses and caresses, made her so hot that she stopped thinking altogether, made her so wild with desire .
 .
 .
 Rick closed his eyes, flushed with both desire and chagrin.

He even came home from work earlier than he had been just to be with me.
 And he took me--places."
 She'd started to say to Hollywood, but her mother might start asking questions about exactly where she'd been and why she hadn't been able to get home.
 "We-we went to the--we went shopping.
 He bought me clothes and all kinds of interesting things.
 And he held me, Mother."
 She looked into her mother's eyes earnestly.
 "Whenever I was frightened or sad, he held me.
 It became so natural to move into his arms for consolation.
 And I felt so comfortable with him.

Fall down the cliff, and find what awaited him at the bottom.
 All he had to do was let go of the bones.
 The confusion burned hotter in his gut.
 “You’re right,” Qurrah said, standing to his full height.
 “No more have to die.
 But what we do doesn’t matter, for more always will.”
 He opened his hands.
 Fueled by dark magic, the bones shot forth, piercing the elf’s throat and eyes.
 Against the window his dying body fell, his arms still held wide as if offering an embrace that would never be returned.
 Qurrah stared at the corpse, and as the blood pooled on the floor he felt himself standing once more on solid ground.

Art – I’ve seen you eat two entire large pizzas, and then sit down on the couch and watch television until you fall asleep and not gain a pound, exercising can’t be much of a consideration for you.
 Eugene – Where did you think I burned off all those pizza calories?
 The Gym?
 Ha!
 I run, a lot, it’s kept me out of trouble on more times than I can count.
 Art – Well considering you can only count to ten that fact doesn’t impress me all that much.
 Eugene – Funny.
 Art – Yes it was.
 Well, it was an interesting story.

“I don’t understand,” he said, clearly concerned about my mental state.
 Maybe I was a few nuts short of a bushel.
 “I’ve lost my mentor.
 Can you teach me magic?
 Help me, so I don’t do something out of order, hurt myself?” His eyebrows drew down, coming together as he began his reply, but a fallen branch cracked at the edge of the clearing and his head snapped toward it.
 I sucked in a harsh breath as Chevelle strode toward us.
 The elf who had been sitting with me was now in a fiercely protective stance in front of me.
 I leaned around him to see, placing my hand on his leg as I angled my head past it.
 That broke his stare and he glanced down at me.
 I watched Chevelle, still walking casually toward us, as if there weren’t two angry panthers preparing to pounce on him.

"Of course, you've got the right answers, and technically you're attacking the problems correctly, but you're leaving out a couple of steps that I think will give you problems a bit later on.
 Please take my advice and spend a little bit of time at the math lab.
 Even if you can't make it every day, you need to come in a few times a week."
 "Yes, ma'am."
 The scolding actually hadn't been that bad, almost like disguised praise.
 Britney looked like she was hoping for something similar, but Mrs. Campbell's expression quickly dashed that idea.
 "You on the other hand definitely need to spend every night at the math lab.
 Your homework was incomplete, and of the problems you bothered to attempt, you didn't do a single one correctly.
 Britney, you're headed towards a failing grade, and while you might not care, your father most certainly does.
 Make my class a priority, or I'll stop in for a checkup and let slip just how poorly you're doing to dear old Dad, and then you'll find yourself riding the bus to school."

"No.
 I mean not really unhappy, at least not with you.
 Maybe with the situation.
 I just feel left out of everything that's going on.
 I know you don't want to get me any more deeply involved with 'dangerous information', but it really sucks sometimes."
 Alec gazed at me for several seconds, and then sighed.
 "If you would like to come watch, you may.
 Give us half an hour, and then ask Donovan to show you the way."
 I felt my face break into a huge smile, but he held a hand up to forestall my thanks.
 "This is all still very much against my better judgment, but I'm finding it increasingly hard to refuse you the things you want the most."

I felt the wind pick up and was whisked back to my normal self.
 I felt fine except for the fact it hurt to stretch my left side.
 I would probably be extremely stiff and sore tomorrow morning, but I was used to that feeling.
 We began to walk back towards the park when Jason stopped us.
 “Hey can Seth and I catch you guys later?
 We have something to do.” Jason grabbed Seth and they took off.
 Emily raised an eyebrow, “Should we be concerned?” “Nah they’re boys, let them do what they have to do,” I said with a quick sigh.
 While we were walking the boys appeared in front of us, holding something behind their backs.
 They seemed to be fighting giggles which usually meant they were hiding something.
 Or they were about to do something that fell under their category of “funny”.

There was something wet on my face.
 Tears?
 No, blood.
 My nose was bleeding.
 It took a moment to get my bearings.
 My bed sheets were a tangle and my clothes were disheveled.
 It must have been a dream.
 I had fallen asleep looking at my mother’s pendant, trying to remember her, and somehow combined it with the disaster I had read of the northern clans.
 It was only a dream.
 Shaken, I sat up, struggling to collect myself.

"Bored already?
 We're only halfway there."
 As I opened my mouth to respond, Vincent turned off the road onto a trail that hardly looked wide enough for a Geo Metro let alone his monster truck.
 I let out a yelp as we dropped down a small hill and then started climbing up the other side of the gully with a small bounce.
 Brandon chuckled at me, but shifted position enough to brace himself against the two beer kegs, and then reached out and wrapped an arm around me.
 A couple of the girls who'd been looking especially condescending over my surprise as we'd gone off-road were now obviously disappointed.
 They were probably wishing it was them instead of me cradled against Brandon's yummy chest.
 I tried not to radiate too much contentment, but rather suspected I failed.
 Vincent wasn't really driving any faster than before, but the fact that we were going up and down slopes I wouldn't have thought could be driven made his current speed reckless.
 Even with Brandon's arm stopping me from flying out of the pickup, I still had a couple of moments where my heart shot up to the top of my throat.

But she did tell more about her duties in the castle.
 Her father must have ruled a vast kingdom.
 And she was his second.
 I heard someone in the front room and knew I had read through the night again.
 I hurriedly slipped the book into my pack and pretended to sleep.
 Ruby was waking me minutes later to head out to the ridge.
 Chapter Fourteen Traveling
 The group was waiting for us when we crossed over the ridge, down to the site where we had spent so many days and nights.
 If I hadn’t been so exhausted from lack of sleep, I would have probably been nervous.
 As it was, I blindly followed Ruby as we gathered and eventually mounted to leave.

“I can’t be like you.
 I can’t be strong like you…”
 The half-orc buckled the old pair of swords next to the gleaming black blades on his belt.
 He then gently took his brother into his arms and carried him back to town.
 The weight of his brother in his hands was a feather compared to the burden on his heart.

In Minneapolis the people you lived next to and the people you associated with were always kept properly segregated.
 I tuned back into what Britney was saying just in time to answer a question with something safely non-committal.
 She didn't seem to need much in the way of responses to keep her talking.
 Probably for hours if she could get away with it.
 "I'm glad you feel the same.
 You'd think they'd be a little more welcoming.
 Instead it's like they go out of their way to make sure you know you don't really fit in.
 We've been here a year, and I still can't get invited to any of the really cool parties."
 I'd never been invited to any parties, let alone cool ones.
 I'd never felt the lack too strongly, but I smiled and let Britney keep talking until Mr. Whethers realized it was time to start class.

And how many others have you raped or tortured?” he asked, trying to keep a calm voice.
 Now Korin looked very surprised and he started looking around.
 Rodregas saw that Korin noticed the study door, though he was working hard to not show it.
 “How many?” Rodregas repeated his question.
 “I am not sure,” Korin said.
 “For us to truly become divine we must of course develop our skills.” As Korin answered the question he took a step back.
 Rodregas quickly stepped forward and pushed him hard against the wall.
 Korin hit with a hard smack and slid to the ground, hurt, but not badly.
 Rodregas slammed the door closed and relocked it.
 Then he quickly reached down and covered Korin’s mouth, pulled him up, and slipped behind him.

"The boy's name's Ben.
 I'm not sure why she's fixated on him the way she has, or why she views Lucy as such a deadly threat to her chances with him, but it's essentially that simple."
 I felt like my head should be reeling from the sheer stupidity.
 Even in a town this small, it didn't seem like the competition for the available males should be a matter for death threats.
 Brandon took my head shaking as denial of what he'd said, rather than disbelief regarding the situation.
 "I promise that every word I just told you is true.
 More importantly, I promise I'll make sure nothing terrible happens to you."
 Looking into Brandon's caring eyes, I almost couldn't believe any of it.
 Being threatened and then having the perfect man come to your rescue didn't happen in real life.
 Then again, maybe I was due for some happy endings.

Qurrah waited until Harruq was around the corner before taking out one of his small glass vials.
 Before he could pull the cork off the top, he heard a voice speak.
 “So many dead by your hands yet a single arrow nearly takes your life?”
 The half-orc froze, the vial clutched in his hands.
 An elf emerged from behind the building, his body decorated in a brilliant green cloak and silvery armor.
 It was the same elf who had fired the first warning shot to Antonil before the entire battle had begun.
 “I am but a poor outcast,” Qurrah said, hiding the handle of the whip underneath the palm of his hand.
 The coiled leather vibrated, hungering for blood.
 “Do not lie to me.
 I have watched you two slaughter my brethren.

As amusing as my internal monologue was, I didn't let it slow my normal morning preparations.
 Almost before I knew it, I was downstairs and once again facing the dreaded decision of whether or not to eat breakfast.
 I already knew I wasn't hungry; the only real decision was how much of Mom's wrath I was willing to face later on.
 It wasn't until I had my hand on the doorknob that I remembered Brandon's promise to pick me up.
 I was so tired I actually considered for a second that he might have been serious.
 Sitting in his car, fighting not to look at his smiling gray eyes, it'd all seemed so reasonable.
 I'd lost my ride and he was grateful I'd saved him from having to interfere with Cassie, so he was going to become my personal chauffeur for the rest of the year.
 Looking at my empty lane, the school bus only minutes away, it seemed more likely Brandon wouldn't even remember talking to me.
 Just like every hot boy with every loser since the dawn of time.
 The thought hurt a little, but I'd had plenty of years to come to understand boys like that didn't go after girls like me.

But you don't need any money.
 I'll buy what you need."
 "No.
 I can't let you--" "Come on."
 He stood up, taking her hand.
 "It'll be payment for the history lesson."
 Marie exclaimed with excitement when she saw Faneuil Hall--she'd been there many times.
 But she didn't recognize the interior at all.
 It contained all kinds of shops with jewelry, candy, and a variety of other goods that she didn't have a chance to inspect because when Rick realized that there weren't any major clothing stores here, he led her back to the car, and they drove to a huge indoor shopping area he called a mall.
 "Why don't we just buy you something comfortable for now?” he suggested as they went into the nearest store.

Your likes.
 Your life.”
 “For what reason?” he asked.
 “I heard those men.
 I saved you from the gallows.
 I would prefer to know more about the life I spared.”
 Harruq leaned his head on his fist and stared at the grass, growing increasingly uncomfortable.
 “I don’t know.
 Not too much to tell really.
 My brother and I grew up in Veldaren, and about three months ago the king kicked out all elves.

“To know love and serve God,” she declared, with a hiss on "serve."
 Later she would tell me she got that answer from a priest in an orphanage where, as a teenager terrified of her own sister, she had gone to seek refuge.
 Sylvia’s challenge sent me to 1 John 4:8.
 "Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love."
 I needed to know more about love.
 I was single after seventeen years married.
 My two kids, both in their teens, were awfully troubled.
 And God seemed too far away.
 I decided to read all I could find on the subject of love.
 I read C.S.

She'd covered her face with her hands and was sobbing.
 How had this happened?

 Was this some fantastic hoax?
 Everything was so strange.

 Rick put his key in the ignition but then turned to look helplessly at the terrified girl.
 "It'll be all right, Marie."
 He leaned over to hug her.

What was it his swords were accomplishing?
 Every action, every kill, seemed to confirm the words of his brother.
 He was a killer and nothing more.
 His legacy would be one of death and emptiness.
 The ghosts of the village clung to his back and neck.
 His choice was made.
 When he looked to the stars, he saw Aurelia’s face among them.
 He tried not to think of what she’d say if she knew what he had done.
 Guilt and regret meant nothing so he choked it down.
 It didn’t matter what he wanted.

He grimaced and said, “Stop hitting me already!” “Alright,” She made a motion to put the stick down and hit him again in the head.
 He glared at her and she threw it on the floor, “Now I’m done.” “So Jason,” I faced him and he looked up at me, “since Seth won’t tell me I’ll ask you.
 How did you guys find us?” “We followed a dwarf that was running here.
 If we didn’t get lost, we would have been here faster,” Jason’s face turned the color of his red Igneerian hair.
 “It’s okay, at least you answered me,” I shot Seth a look.
 “Well if it’s okay with you boys, we would like to get to bed.
 It’s almost 1:30 in the morning, and I would like to get home before my dad wakes himself up,” Emily said, and walked towards her house.
 I waved quickly and followed.
 The rest of the night was quiet and didn’t include singing dwarfs.
 Before we went to bed though there was a lot of furious writing as Emily tried to write everything down.

Past experience had pretty much established that when Britney got like this there was no reasoning with her.
 Trying to explain that she hadn't seen the look from my end, that Isaac most definitely hadn't been attracted to me, would be useless.
 I was pleasantly surprised when Britney's annoyance seemed to have blown over by the time we left the building.
 Before we'd even made it out of the parking lot, Britney was once again chattering about everyone else in the school and what they were or weren't doing lately.
 Considering that I still couldn't put a face with most of the names she was tossing around, the gossip wasn't just uninteresting, it was a near ordeal.
 It wasn't until I looked over at the speedometer that I realized we really had been driving longer than normal rather than the gossip just making it seem to take forever.
 Britney caught me registering the fact she was driving under the speed limit for the first time I could remember, and broke off recounting Amy Stevens' supposed fling with one of the football players just long enough to blush.
 "I figured I should be more careful of how fast I drive.
 You know, my dad keeps threatening to take away my car if I get any more tickets.
 With everything else going on right now he just might do it."

I thought that while I was growing up all those days I hadn't given him anything.
 But I was wrong.
 He told a friend of ours many months ago that I had made him happier than he'd ever been.
 "I know how hard it was between you.
 Perhaps when two complex people can't live with each other, it's because they need each other so much they hit head on.
 "I have been thinking how important it was for Eric to be free.
 God didn't make him for this world.
 God made Eric for a world someplace farther beyond our imaginations than any of us can comprehend.
 Someplace where he could run with the wind all day."
 Our friend Kenny Neidermeyer's mom was a Spanish teacher who also volunteered with a Tijuana charity.

I went to follow him when Seth said, “We should tell them about our dreams.” I turned around and faced him.
 “We should, they need to know in case they have ones like ours.” Seth nodded and followed me as we joined everyone else outside.
 Emily waited for us and then headed into the woods.
 She waved to the dragon and we disappeared once more.
 I stared off into the trees, waiting for Seth's cue to tell them about the ghost kids.
 Seth raised his hand, signaling for us to stop.
 He put a finger to his lips and pointed in front of him.
 I crept up and peered at where he was pointing.
 A bunch of dwarves and tall, muscular men crowded around something.
 The men had double swords sheathed on their back, long ears, and long black hair.

I wanted it to be perfect.
 I should have known that wasn't possible.
 Not with everything hanging over our heads."
 It felt funny to smile.
 The gesture belonged with perfect times, not ones in which people other than me were having nervous breakdowns.
 Then again, a bad night with Alec still somehow managed to beat most other good nights.
 "Everything was almost perfect.
 If there was anything less than ideal, it wasn't your fault."
 "Still, I'd like to make it up to you."
 He looked down at my ankle and then smiled with a hint of mischievousness.

They consulted the witnesses and booked Kenny for vandalism.
 The teachers to whom Eric surrendered turned him over to the police, who drove him home to Sylvia and sent a report about him to the school board.
 A few days later, Eric and Kenny got expelled for having been intoxicated on school grounds.
 Mrs. Hazel Bole, our vice principal, summoned Billy and me.
 She was a big woman, in size and spirit, a person of understanding and compassion, who tried hard to prepare us seniors for the real world.
 She said, “I know you two were with Eric and Kenny.” “So expel me,” I said.
 “Me too,” Billy said.
 She shook her head.
 “You probably think I could keep Eric and Kenny in school, but here’s the way things are.
 Once the police get involved, the school board has to expel.

She told me that she didn’t have sex as part of her massage.
 I assured her that I just wanted a massage from a pretty young lady and I had no other motive.
 I repeated that I often got massaged from the same older woman and I thought it would be a treat to get a massage from a beautiful young one.
 As I lay there, I could see her in the mirror and we talked from this reflection.
 She pressed the issue of buying the pills.
 She climbed off of me and stood up next to the bed between me and the mirror.
 She looked at me as she slowly pulled her sweat pants off exposing a stunning young body and sleek thong underwear.
 She tugged slightly at her thong to adjust it as she looked over her shoulder in the mirror and checked herself out.
 She then sat back on top of me while she continued to talk to me and I watched her in the mirror as she pulled her top off exposing her bare breasts.
 I kept watching her in the mirror and she was watching me.

 Toby—yeah, I loved that cat.
 Chick sang with Jeff’s Collie, what was her name?
 Hayley?
 Something beautiful like that.
 And she could sing, Big Mama Thornton kind of voice out of this little wispy Southern gal.

It was stupid, but I couldn't help feeling this was yet another sign I wasn't going to win a ticket.
 I tried to shake the feeling during History, but was still fighting it when I walked into Physics.
 In a departure from his normal routine, Alec was already seated when I arrived.
 I flipped open my notebook and tried to distract myself with a brief sketch, only to tear the page out and ball it up as the bell rang.
 I looked up to see Alec staring at me, which just made me mad.
 It was completely unfair.
 I wasn't going to get to go to Les Misérables, but he was rich enough to fly to New York and book the whole theater.
 As Mrs. Alexander stood up to take roll, a burst of static silenced us all.
 "It's my pleasure to read off the names of the five winners in our drawing for tickets to Les Misérables."
 "The first winner is Pam White."

Physics was my own little personal hell for the next forty minutes.
 I absorbed absolutely nothing from the rest of the discussion about calculating mechanical advantage, and when we were finally released into our groups Alec and I didn't even look each other in the eyes.
 I gutted out the last five minutes by pretending I was completely absorbed in a reference book while Alec started running preliminary calculations.
 He was out of his seat and halfway to the door by the time I'd even realized the bell had rung to dismiss us.
 Spanish was both better and worse.
 Better because without Alec sitting six feet away from me I was able to think about something other than him, worse because we had a pop quiz and I barely placed in the A- range despite having spent a fair amount of time on my vocabulary.
 Math was plain and simply burning up too much time.
 Something needed to change because my only hope of going to college was to get a scholarship, or load up on student loans, and I had no desire to graduate sixty thousand dollars in debt and spend the next fifteen years trying to pay it all off.
 By the time I met up with Britney in the hall I was emotionally exhausted and could feel an attack hovering in the wings.
 Much as I'd have liked to, I couldn't continue to blow her off.

If you want to know more ask dad about women.
 Johnny – Ask dad about women?
 You have to be kidding.
 Anyway I’m going to check on dinner too.
 (Johnny exits stage, leaving Jim to go back to Sumo Assassin)
 Scene 6
 The basement, the table is in the forefront now.
 Jim is still reading Sumo Assassin while lying on a couch at the edge of the stag.
 The other characters bring in the various courses and implements necessary for Thanksgiving dinner.
 Slowly everyone else trickles in, starting with Art and Karen.

His voice sounded like a superbly-tuned cello.
 I filed the information away as further evidence he wasn't really our age.
 "Yes please, Brandon can only take me home on Tuesdays and Thursdays."
 It wasn't my imagination; Isaac flinched slightly, and Rachel's smile momentarily turned plastic.
 I mentally kicked myself for having once again stepped squarely between the Capulets and Montagues.
 Isaac recovered with admirable speed, smiling as he gestured us forward.
 "Well, then, after you."
 It wasn't until Rachel and Isaac were driving away that I realized she'd completely pulled me out of my funk.
 I still didn't know that I could really depend on her, but at least I knew she'd try her hardest.
 Chapter 17 I reached out groggily to turn off my alarm, and then wished it was still the weekend so I wouldn't have to get up and go to school.

She’d tried so hard to get back this morning.
 She’d worn only her 1927 clothes, and her mind hadn’t wandered to 2011 at all.
 What more could she do?
 Well, one thing she wasn’t going to do was give up, she determined as she played with the hem of her dress.
 She’d strolled through her garden countless times without walking into 2011, so who knew how many times she’d have to walk in the garden to get back to 1927?
 She wasn’t going to give up.
 Rick, still concerned about Marie, left work at 4:30, making a quick stop to pick up a surprise for her.
 To his dismay, he found her huddled in a corner of the sofa, still wearing her 1927 clothes.
 “Hi, sweetheart,” he greeted her, going to sit beside her.
 “Are you feeling better?” “I’m all right.” “I brought you something.”  He handed her a plastic bag.

Johnny – Just give he the controller you whiner.

 (Johnny and Liz play, both making suitable movements.
 Neither are as animated as either Jim or Eugene.
 The game lasts for a couple minutes.)
 (Running commentary)
 Jim – How does she do that?
 Eugene – I dunno.
 Jim – Woah, I didn’t even know that was possible.
 Eugene – Why isn’t she getting kicked in the forehead too?

Jim – Indeed it is.
 Indeed it is.
 Which is odd since Eugene seems to love Johnny like he was his own little brother.
 Art – What irony, if I wasn’t hip-deep in it, maybe it wouldn’t make me want to cry.
 Jim – Maybe we’ll get lucky.
 Art – How so?
 Jim – Maybe on the way home today we’ll get into a terrible flaming car wreck and get ourselves rather dead.
 Art – How is that lucky?
 Jim – It’s not, but it defiantly beats going home and telling Johnny that Gene is soon to be a member of the family.
 And then spending the rest of whenever with Johnny…

Already, 156 countries have signed the treaty, owing either to coercion or indifference, and the number is expected to increase to 170 out of 179 states by 1995.
 The acceptance of non-proliferation by these countries further delegitimizes the continued possession of nuclear weapons by any country.
 All of the treaty non-signatories can be persuaded to sign in exchange for annihilation of these weapons by those that now possess them.
 Under these circumstances, refusal to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty could be considered sufficient grounds for expulsion from UN membership.
 Without a universal ban, the efforts of the nuclear powers to stop proliferation lack moral authority.
 Arguments are often advanced that nuclear weapons cannot be ‘dis-invented’, and that the danger of a rogue state or terrorist group acquiring and threatening use of these weapons necessitates that the present nuclear powers retain them for such a contingency.
 With the massive conventional firepower already available, nuclear weapons are not needed for defence, even against a rogue state with nuclear capability, and they do not represent a credible defence against terrorism under any circumstances.
 How could nuclear weapons conceivably be used to retaliate against terrorism?
 Alternative solutions can be found to address these threats far more effectively.
 Similar arguments were made in the past against complete eradication of chemical weapons.

Doi’van was clearly asking himself the same thing.
 He looked over at Rodregas and shrugged.
 “We both have the power of the Infernal Realm in us.
 Is it easier for us to manage following the path of righteousness to let the power burn free or to take on the form of a greater sigil and bind the Infernal magic to a specific form?
 I think we must choose carefully.” Doi’van said and added, “For me the Bunei seems right.” Doi’van paused in that thoughtful way he had, considering all sides before taking action.
 “If it consumes my Infernal power I would gain its strengths.
 If I am lucky, what magic ability I have left will be mortal or Celestial in nature.
 The Bunei are creatures of magic, they are both great warriors and thinkers and magicians and are even known to sometimes help others.
 I cannot pass this chance up.
 I must see what will happen.” Rodregas nodded; they both knew they would not get this chance twice.

“Both of you, stop that this instant!”
 Through blurred vision, Harruq saw a woman with auburn hair standing at the edge of the alley.
 The patrolmen also turned to look, their weapons still in hand.
 “Who the abyss…‌oh, go on back to your forest, Aurelia.
 Nothing to see here.”
 The woman pointed to the bleeding half-orc.
 “I see plenty.”
 “Just cleaning up some filth.” The bowman shifted his bow onto his shoulder.
 “Now move along.”
 “I don’t see any filth.

An entire gram more than I would have ventured to risk myself, and done before anyone else.
 I thought the pair of you would make a great team."
 The easiest thing would have been to stay quiet and just let her believe I'd played an integral part of the project, but I didn't like getting credit for something I hadn't done.
 It was the worst kind of lying.
 "Mrs. Alexander, I didn't actually do any of it.
 I kept making mistakes."
 She chuckled so hard, for a second I thought the pencil behind her ear was going to fall out.
 "I rather suspect you're understating your accomplishments, my dear.
 Didn't contribute indeed.
 As if Nora's favorite student would just sit around while there were equations to solve."

Imeralda spoke up, “I hope you are not offended, but I am part Nymph and our healing powers work differently than yours.
 She should heal faster for the next few days.” Rodregas hid his smile; it was a good cover story.
 “Thank you,” said the healer.
 “Do you have the strength to heal a few others?
 I think we will lose several more otherwise.” Rodregas could not tell if the healer believed Imeralda’s story or recognized what was going on and was going along with it to save his patients.
 “I would be happy to help them, but I have to do it as privately as possible,” said Imeralda.
 The healer did not seem to take the odd request as being unusual and simply stepped away after leading them to two more patients.
 The healer thanked Imeralda for her healing work and the three were heading out the door when a frail voice called out, “Rodregas, may I speak to you?” Rodregas turned around and noticed for the first time the tall shapely form of Karun who had defeated him with sword and shield.
 She had propped herself up now on the bed and waved them over.
 Her arm was clearly broken and her side was bandaged.

I sat up, curling my legs against my chest, and wrapped my arms around them, pulling tightly in.
 Though I didn’t speak, I occasionally glanced, or glared, at Ruby.
 She sat, immobile, watching me.
 It was morning before she broke.
 “You have your fire back.” It hadn’t occurred to me.
 I held my hand out and flicked a flame above my palm, then promptly extinguished it.
 I tried moving a stone from the ground to no avail.
 Just fire.
 I sighed.
 But Ruby looked hopeful.

Few have been able to ignite the aspiration for continuous learning and the capacity for original creativity that are the most profound characteristics of human consciousness.
 Measured in these terms, even the most developed nations still have a long way to go and much that can be done to further the development of their people.
 To sum up, 10 years ago when we presented the report of the International Commission on Peace and Food, we were optimistic that humankind will grasp the uncommon opportunities provided by democratic systems of governance and technological and knowledge revolutions for achieving a world without hunger and where every individual has an opportunity for a productive and healthy life.
 The onward march of technology is still in full swing, but the political commitment to foster cooperative human security worldwide is yet to emerge.
 The Information Age has given meaning and content to the concept of a global village.
 The threats associated with climate change and biodiversity loss also underline the fact that while humankind may be segregated by political frontiers, our fates are intertwined ecologically.
 Economically also, islands of prosperity cannot co-exist forever in the midst of oceans of poverty.
 Both unsustainable lifestyles and unacceptable poverty must become features of the past, if we are to curb the growing violence in the human heart.
 Ten years after presentation of our report, we remain convinced that universal health, harmony and happiness are still within our reach, if only we imbibe the eternal truth contained in the following message of Lord Krishna delivered on the battlefield of life called Kurukshetra:
 We human beings can become whatever we sincerely aspire to become.

I remember one, in particular, an Aztec poem, and it began, “Rejoice, rejoice, my flower king, you own many jewels—“ and I thought, wow, that’s for me, man.
 It was an egotistical reaction, I know.
 Where “Flower King” comes from.
 And there were these little altars she had constructed, with tiny clay figures and candles.
 And the floor—what there was of it (laughs)—like I say, was awash in album covers and books.
 Books stacked in these tottering towers.
 Names I’d never heard of, at that time: Kis, Malcolm Lowry, Svevo, Madame Blavatsky, Fludd, Dee, Goncharov, Bruno Schulz, Philip Wylie, Whatsername Yates, Blake, Maturin, Borges, Marie-Louise von Franz,  a book called History of Secret Societies, one, I think called On the conjuring of angels.
 It was mind-boggling.
 The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage.
 I felt like I was in a secret underground lab, a lab for the soul.

 He raised his head to look at her.

 Why I want to make your dreams come true?
 I love you, Marie."
 Marie's breath caught in her throat.

The Commission, therefore, developed and presented a comprehensive strategy for job-led economic growth.
 Over the past decade, changes in the employment picture lend credence to ICPF’s perspective.
 The American economy experienced a decade-long expansion, fuelling high levels of employment at home, while stimulating job growth throughout East Asia, attracting a massive influx of foreign technical workers and setting the stage for a global outsourcing boom which is still in its infancy.
 Among the advanced economies, unemployment declined from an average of 6.9 per cent in the period 1985-94 to 6.5 per cent during the last 10 years.
 It fell by 10 per cent in France, 25 per cent in Italy, a third in Netherlands, 50 per cent in Spain and 70 per cent in Ireland.
 It is declining but remains 10 per cent higher than the average for 1985-94 in Germany, which is still recovering from the economic impact of reunification.
 The new market economies of Eastern Europe are growing rapidly.
 But these positive trends are no grounds for complacency.
 While they may dispel fears of an irreversible shrinkage of the job market in OECD countries, the proportion of long term unemployed remains at an unacceptably high 29 per cent of the total, indicating that these countries have not yet evolved successful strategies to address the issue.
 Left to itself, unemployment may continue to deprive large numbers of people in these countries from enjoying basic economic rights, unless concerted steps are taken to remove the perceptual and structural barriers to full employment.

My instructor would start us out with the prayer and then we would meditative on our duty.” “For how long?” asked Imeralda.
 “Until you are sure of what your duty is,” Rodregas replied, hearing the voice of his old drill Knight Captain.
 All the instructors had been retired knights who enjoyed teaching the squires.
 He did not think the two would join him for this but both pulled their weapons and imitated his position, Doi’van with his large great sword balanced on his powerful arms, Imeralda grabbed her bow instead of a short sword, which with her lack of training was probably a good idea.
 Rodregas focused inwards and resumed his meditation.
 He was finding it wonderful to do the meditation again; Rodregas had a lot of good memories from his life as a squire, before everything had gone wrong.
 Part of him felt uncomfortable for doing this again, like he no longer had the right.
 But once you are raised from Page to Squire as he had been, you always got to keep the title of Squire.
 Squires who were not raised to knighthood were much sought after; their martial training and their education, especially in law and etiquette, were a great foundation for many careers.
 As Rodregas knelt on the ground balancing the sword across his arms, and the sun warm on his face, he thought back to that time when he had used his Squire title to get into the officer academy in the Ramig Empire.

Finally after waiting what seemed like forever, but was probably only about twenty minutes, Rodregas slowly made his way back up through the keep.
 When he poked his head out the entrance there was no sign of Dire Cats or chickens, but he did note a few stray feathers in the courtyard.
 Other than a few alarmed sounds from the chicken coop, it was surprisingly quiet.
 Rodregas felt a feeling of relief at the idea that the lions had eaten.
 Still, he double-checked the keep and the courtyard very carefully before bringing out the cart and the horses and loading up all his booty.
 The cart groaned with the load.
 After a last check for Dire Cats in front of the keep he headed out and away from both Raven Keep and Raven Town and away from his old life.
 CHAPTER 4 A FRESH START OR AN OLD PROBLEM
 Raven Keep, unlike many fortifications, was not located on a high spot.
 In fact, it was perched half way down a gentle valley.

He knew the depth of his lack of true courage from his years of failure to act before now.
 He went through the guardroom and was happy to see that Captain Poir had followed orders; there was no sign of the eight or so prisoners, including his rescued AElfin maiden.
 He stared at the problem in the largest cell.
 There, sprawled on the floor, were the two female Dire Cats that had been used to trap the Celestial lion.
 Rodregas swore that as soon as he looked at the cats, they were already looking at him straight in the eye.
 The large green eyes demanded something of him even as the animals lay in apparent complete relaxation, sprawled on the stone floor.
 He had to let them out, but how was he going to do that?
 If he simply opened the door, they might tear him apart.
 Rodregas thought the cats may also attack the guard at the front gate on their way out.
 He looked around and realized that the other side of the hall had a door that opened in the same direction as the door leading to the cage.

I didn't feel much like playful banter, but I marshaled a semi-convincing smile and gave it my best go.
 "Oh, I trust you, I just know that you've got more important things to worry about.
 One of these times you'll either forget to come get me, or you'll forget to tell me you're not coming by anymore."
 Brandon let the silence build for several seconds.
 "I'd try and convince you I'm not going to do any of that to you, but I suspect that's just going to take time."
 I was busy kicking myself for having cast such a pall over the morning, when Brandon sighed.
 "We should talk about what happened to you yesterday."
 "I don't know what you're talking about.
 Nothing happened."
 Deny everything.

 Out the window Aurelia stared, frowning as she watched the battle unfold.
 “Aurelia,” called a voice from behind.
 She turned to see a female elf, a friend of hers from many years before she moved to Woodhaven.
 “Yes, Felewen?”
 Felewen stood beside her and faced the window.
 Her hair was tied in a long, black ponytail, her slender figure covered by rare chainmail crafted of the hardest metals known to the intelligent races.
 She had come from deep within Nellassar, the thriving capital of the Dezren elves, as just one of many that had arrived to protect the town.
 “Many are dying,” Felewen said.
 “The humans have a spellcaster of their own who repelled our ambush.”

In truth he did not know how good or bad their odds were.
 He knew they were not good, but his mind did not spin with the odds.
 He simply focused on the rightness of Doi’van’s words.
 Trying to attack an armed keep probably had far worse odds, and for what?
 So that they could steal horses; so that they could better their odds to escape a future fight?
 Here, if they succeeded, the three would not be stealing horses, they would be freeing people from slavery.
 Rodregas looked into Doi’van’s eyes.
 He was resolute.
 Rodregas felt humbled at the man’s bravery, at his passion, at his strength.
 Rodregas knew there was no such thing as a hero,  simply people that sometimes choose to do the right thing when it was a hard choice.

He rose and went to hug her.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart," he said, immediately kicking himself for his hypocrisy.
 She sighed, letting herself be comforted by his embrace.
 August was just around the corner now, and she and her mother normally spent August at Cape Cod.
 Her father joined them on weekends.
 They wouldn't go there this year—not with her still missing.
 She'd been gone five weeks now.
 Five weeks and two days.
 And they had no idea what had happened to her.
 "I love you, sweetheart."

But he was obsessed.
 The moment it slipped from his lips, he became more focused on that than anything else.
 Making me his bride.
 I couldn’t understand.
 He tried to explain.
 “I want you forever.
 I need you, Lizzy.” The yearning in his voice was clear on the last part and I was surprised that I ached for him a little, felt for his pain and need.
 He touched me then and I thought I understood when he continued, “We could be together…” Marriage.
 Yes, he wanted to join us.
 I bit my lip, undecided.

Her head shot up and she gave me a big smile.
 “Yup, never better.
 I'm just having a minute to myself.” “Okay...” I trailed off.
 Seth walked over to join us.
 “We should get moving and find somewhere else to stay.
 If we stay and argue in the forest, something worse is bound to find us.” “Right, lead the way,” I said and pushed off the tree.
 Seth nodded and I walked beside him as he led us, once again, through the woods.
 Emily and Jason were talking quietly about something which gave us both the opportunity to talk.
 “You think Kojas sent them?” I mumbled to him and pushed a branch away.
 He looked at me from the corner of his eye.

The bedroom doors had been kicked in, and broken bongs and stem pipes, empty cigarette packs, matchbooks, just trash littered every surface.
 I don’t know what the hell these people (my son!)
 did in here, but the carpet could not have been dirtier if they raised farm animals indoors.
 Pictures of Brandon and his friends holding automatic weapons were nearly the only things upright.
 Sex toys filled the drawers and around his bed.
 Apparently, it had been a real bohemian festival at some point, at least to the people who hung here.
 Everything was broken or ajar, apparently ransacked while Brandon was in jail.
 Nearly all of his belongings that were worth anything were stolen by the scumbags who had been his peers.
 We heard Brandon’s girlfriend, Tiffanie, was afraid to return to the house while our son was in jail and it was probably the smartest thing she had done in years.
 Brandon had accumulated flat screen TV’s, computers, stereo equipment, guns, you name it and it was all gone.

"And dream about your debut?"
 He smiled.
 "We'll go see the movie as soon as it comes out.
 And buy the video when it comes out."
 He was thrilled when she didn't say she'd probably be back in 1927 before then.
 She was quiet during the ride home, remembering the scene she'd done.
 And how she'd peered through a camera.
 And sat in a director's chair as he walked his sitcom actors through a scene.
 It hadn't been a page out of a fairy tale like she'd expected, but it had been exciting nevertheless.
 And a dream-come-true.

I will pound on them when we are ready to leave.” And with a nervous nod the doors slid closed behind them.
 As the door closed Gorin hastily added, “Remember not to touch anything until the Grand Marshal is present.” Doi’van nodded at the now closed doors and raised his torch.
 The three gazed around the room in wonderment.
 In response to the torch the room seemed to respond with a vague light of its own, which came from all directions.
 The chamber was large with a tall vaulted ceiling like some temple, but no rows of seats or prayer mats did this temple hold.
 Instead it was filled with beasts; lions and wolves and the great mythical animals of the Celestial Realm.
 Most of these he recognized as the great totems of the Celestial Realm, each representing great power.
 The great beasts were full-size and, but for their lack of movement, Rodregas would have thought that they must have traveled to the Celestial Realm itself.
 “Oh, my Gods, they look real.
 I thought they would be made of stone like the frog,” said Imeralda.

If a vacation was the surprise, it must include her, but she didn't want to make any assumptions.
 "What plans have you made for your vacation?"
 "I thought we'd spend Saturday shopping for whatever you may need, and we'll leave Sunday morning."
 "Leave for where?"
 "Los Angeles."
 She frowned.
 "Los Angeles?"
 "Hollywood."
 Marie screamed, almost knocking Rick off his feet when she leapt into his arms.
 "Thank you, thank you, thank you!

But we played fairly well together until, one Sunday evening, I wanted to go to a certain dance, which was held weekly and at which I always danced with other girls in addition to Liz.
 This time, Liz wanted me to myself, at her place.
 Her folks were out of town.
 Maybe the proposition and setup spooked me.
 Anyway, for reasons lost to time, I went to the dance alone, and afterward took Serena Furby for a ride.
 I hadn’t known that Serena and Liz sat next to each other in summer school.
 Liz called me various names and tried to get our friend Les Falos to thrash me.
 He considered the proposition, then laughed it off.
 A couple weeks passed before Bill Torrey came and asked if I would mind him taking Liz out.
 No problem, I said.

In fact, I think you would be wise to finish one of the top winners.
 The next is the bow…,” Doi’van glancing at Imeralda.
 Rodregas could not help but smile, “I know you guys think of my skill with the bow in terms of my inability to use the Black Yew bows.
 But really, I can shoot a bow with skill.” Doi’van and Imeralda looked at him doubtfully.
 “The challenge,” said Doi’van, “is not to be simply good but to be able to outshoot over one hundred other highly skilled warriors, and the targets are multiple and difficult including a moving target.
 Unfortunately, all the targets are within normal range for a human, your strength will not help.
 The good news is this is a competition of skill and they provide the bows.
 The bad news is that it is up to each competing squire to have his own equipment for the other three competitions.
 The sword and the shield competition are limited to light armor.
 You will be at a disadvantage.

Art - (roars with laughter) You?
 A model?
 Eugene - Yes, I did some modeling.
 What’s so funny about that.
 Art – Gene, sometimes you’re like another son so I hate to say this.
 You’ve not exactly got the good looks necessary to be a successful model in the ordinary sense.
 What were you modeling for?
 Eugene – I’d rather not talk about it.
 Art – That’s not what I think it means, does it?

I won't tell her, and she's going to love you."
 They went into the kitchen to fix breakfast.
 Marie glanced at Rick as he poured juice.
 When he noticed her glance, she dropped her eyes to the bread she was buttering.
 "Rick," she began at last, "do you remember when you first kissed me?"
 "With perfect clarity."
 He grinned at her.
 She smiled a bit, her eyes on her knife as she spread the butter.
 "I wanted you to kiss me then."
 "I know."

I would later realize that she fed us first because she was so broke she couldn’t afford to feed herself.
 In all the years after the divorce, she had never received a dime in child support from my biological father, Richard.
 There were times at this house when my mother would have us hide in the closet with her.
 This would happen when the rent was past due.
 She would make a game out of it but you could see the fear in her eyes, as this was no game.
 The landlord would come to our house to collect the rent personally.
 He would first knock on the door and then let himself in the house.
 We were quiet in the closet in my mother’s room.
 The landlord would walk through the house yelling my mother’s first name, Karla .

Dirty hair was strewn over the grass.
 “Never had much,” Harruq said.
 “That bone sword was my only possession.
 Still had to hide it because of that bully.
 You know, it’s probably still there, buried underneath our home.”
 “You and your brother had such rough beginnings,” Aurelia said, tucking away the dagger.
 “Very rough.”
 Harruq shrugged.
 “Never seemed a big deal to us.
 Others were better off.

He didn't have much faith-- Marie's scream almost made him drop the chicken.
 Depositing the pan on the stove, he ran to the living room.
 She was sitting up, gasping for breath, a look of terror on her face.
 "What's wrong?"
 he asked, hovering over her.
 "I want to go home!
 I don't belong here--I want to go home!"
 Her heart was beating wildly, and she was having a hard time catching her breath.
 The fear and panic that had faded with fatigue and the novelty of it all were suddenly back full force, and all she knew was that she was far from home and from everything she knew.
 "Calm down.

A soft blow of air from her lips turned the grass to dirt so that a large space lay available for her to write on.
 She wrote ‘Harruk’ in the dirt with her finger, spacing out each letter.
 Harruq stared at the words representing his name, feeling a tiny thrill.
 “How about my last name, Tun?”
 She wrote out T-u-n.
 The half-orc stared, absorbing every detail of his name.
 “Can I see your name?” he asked.
 Aurelia nodded, tracing her hand across the dirt.
 “A-u-r-e-l-i-a.”
 The half-orc smiled at the name.

Acknowledgments Writing has been a lifelong dream, and it has only been made possible due to the support of a lot of people, notably my amazing wife Kelly and our wonderful children Jonah, Steven and Autumn.
 Both Kelly and Autumn played key roles in beta reading and editing.
 I also need to recognize my editor Eddie Lunsford.
 My parents, of course, should never be left out of acknowledgements of any of my accomplishments.

 “Move along, move along,” Rodregas said.
 He prodded the prisoner up the roughly hewn stone steps none too gently with the butt end of the lit torch in his hand.
 "We don’t have all night."
 The rough handling of the prisoner seemed like a brash act for a man of sixty years, since the young man could have broken him in half with ease if he chose to do so.

You now have the right to enter the Chamber that holds the greater sigils.
 I think you need to go there now.” Rodregas nodded.
 “Can I bring you two into the Chamber as my advisors?” “That does seem to be allowed,” said Imeralda, “Traditionally that is more about fathers with sons, not half bloods and Hellborns, but I think we might have a bigger problem.” She stopped speaking mid sentence, and Rodregas curiously looked back at her, but she was staring ahead.
 A figure stood there tall and graceful.
 He had appeared out of nowhere, as if by magic.
 It was Van’dret.
 “Ah, I see the three of you are all together and far away from the others, how convenient for me.” Van’dret casually reached out toward the side wall and they could vaguely hear him mumble a few words.
 A second later the sound of doors slamming and bolts and locks sliding closed echoed from every direction.
 “I hope you don’t mind, but I don’t think I want to be interrupted.” Rodregas reached for his sword, but found he did not have one.
 He froze for but a second, unsure of what to do.

“They are here.” It was Steed’s voice, but I didn’t raise my head, the blood still hot in my cheeks.
 “Take her to the ridge, I will meet you after…” Chevelle stopped midsentence.
 After what?
 Steed must have been concerned because Chevelle explained, “Ruby gave her a little dust… to relax.” “Frey,” Steed said from beside me.
 I glanced at the door.
 Chevelle was gone.
 “Are you well?” “Ugh.” He snickered.
 “Come on.” He swept me up, planning to carry me.
 My head spun.
 “No.

I sat up in bed, excited to finally be getting real details about Alec's life.
 "Please lie back down.
 You have to at least be trying to sleep.
 Otherwise I'm heading back downstairs.
 And don't pout.
 It won't influence me in the slightest."
 "It's just sooo hard for my merely human ears to hear you from so far away.
 Maybe if you were to move over here I wouldn't have to strain to catch every word."
 It was so blatantly coy, I almost couldn't believe I was saying it.
 It had been said though.

I’m clean, that’s all we need to know right now.
 CM: 	“Aphids on the Heliotrope.”
 BG:  	That was for Lor’s mom.
 She’s a big gardener, got this incredible spread of flowers in her back yard.
 She’s taught me a lot about simple pleasures, flowers, feathers, sun.
 She’s practically a Native American shaman—she, oh, never mind….
 CM: 	“Nature breathing heavy/trying to keep up with her.’
 BG:  	Yeah, yeah, that’s Lor’s mom, Sadie.
 She’s remarkable, really, a sort of Zen master just in her daily life.
 I mean, plant a seed, watch it grow, you know, that whole Lennon/Ono message.

He was starting to think his new body was ambidextrous, equally comfortable with both hands.
 That could prove useful, but would require some additional training to take full advantage of.
 “Actually, since I was kicking your ass barehanded, even with a knife in my belly, how about this: I won’t kill the bunch of you if you keep your distance and leave my camp at first light?” Rodregas’ tone was casual.
 “And, if you ask nicely, I will even leave you a few supplies to get to the nearest town if you promise not to tell anyone that you saw me.
 And you will promise that in the name of the All-Father, or you will die at my hand.” Rodregas did not smile now, nor did they.
 “So you think you could kill all of us?
 Put your sword down now!” demanded Audrian.
 Rodregas stepped forward and buried just the tip of his right-handed short sword into Audrian’s chest, hitting the ribs but not shoving the blade through.
 Audrian gasped in surprise and fell back.
 “Swear you will keep my secret and you live, do not and you die.

3.Eliminate crop losses: In Russia and the other republics of the former USSR, highest priority in agriculture must be given to efforts that will increase the availability of food and reduce the huge crop losses and massive food imports.
 These losses vary by crop and region but average between 25 and 50 per cent of total field production for major crops.
 A reduction in crop losses could completely eliminate millions of tons of grain imports.
 The reasons for such enormous losses include poor quality of seeds and planting material, the lack of sufficient local storage capacity, in efficient and inappropriate equipment for planting, harvesting, storage and processing, poorly motivated farm workers and short age of labour at harvest time.
 Demonstration projects have proved that potato losses can be reduced from 35 per cent to under 5 per cent in one year.
 A viable solution requires concerted and coordinated activity by government, industry and agriculture at a time when each is operating in isolation from the others.
 The main elements of a viable plan to reduce losses for foodgrains, vegetables and potatoes have been proposed by a Dutch cooperative agri-business firm.
 The aim of the plan is to reduce food imports to zero and eliminate food shortages within three to five years.
 The plan requires acquisition of foreign production and storage technology, but depends only marginally on import of equipment, most of which can be manufactured in domestic defence facilities.
 The hard currency requirement is minimal.

I am now beyond irritated, as their lackadaisical attitude could equal another disappointment and a setback for the mission to get my son on with his life and out of a possible prison sentence.
 They asked me what I wanted from the nearby hamburger joint as they relayed orders to another officer via a cell phone.
 I wanted nothing!
 Eating was the last thing on my mind and my stomach was churning with every passing moment.
 I just wanted to get on with it and go home in one piece.
 It was an odd sight for me as I watched these officers chow down their burgers and sip on their drinks reminiscing about the drug deal they just finished.
 Just another day at the office, I guess.
 In a moment, my crack-berry starts to blow up with one call after the next from Ashley, wanting to know when we are doing this deal.
 I must keep buying time with excuses, now nearing a two-hour delay waiting for the cops to come from the other bust.
 It is looking like this deal is not going to happen either.

Art – Exactly, which in comparison makes my meager gleanings of knowledge about women in general seem to be the definitive source of information.
 Jim – I’m thinking that two nothings is nothing.
 Art – Sit back and listen to your old man, you’ll learn something, hopefully.
 Jim – What if I don’t end up learning anything?
 Art – Then I’ll finally have proof that you were dropped on your head as a baby.
 Jim – You mean you need more proof than my miss-shapen head?
 Art – That would most likely be genetic.
 Both your mother and I are reasonably smart individuals, as were our parents.
 If you’re dumb, well then your head must have been tampered with after you were removed from the packaging.
 Jim – Always possible, though I think if anything is wrong it’s because of designer flaws.

I mean, it looks pretty real to me."
 "They're definitely being careful not to kill each other.
 Isaac could've connected with his claws instead of his fist."
 Jasmin and Jessica were circling each other now.
 It reminded me of a fight I'd seen between two feral dogs while I was still in grade school.
 The dogs had circled for five or ten seconds, and then one had thrown himself at the other.
 A neighbor had broken the fight up with a few thrown stones before it'd come to a grisly end, but it'd been obvious once the first dog had latched onto his opponent's throat that it was only a matter of time before the smaller dog would've died.
 This was exactly the same, only it happened faster as Jasmin blurred into motion.
 One moment she was growling at Jess from a distance of more than five feet, the next instant she was on top of Jess, and her teeth were latched around the smaller wolf's throat.
 Dominic's hand tightened on mine as Jess began to whine, but Alec took a menacing step forward and Jasmin released Jessica with another growl.

We were on Murphy Canyon Road, a two-lane without sidewalks or curbs, bordered by vacant, hilly land.
 I dosed off.
 Then Cliff joined the rest of us.
 The parked station wagon we rammed might've saved our lives, as it kept the convertible from running up the side of a bank and flipping onto our heads.
 The station wagon was wrecked, Bob's Ford was totaled, and the four of us got cited on account of the case of beer in the trunk, which was meant for the beach party.
 Maybe in consideration of it being our prom-night, the police dropped charges on the condition that Cliff agreed to pay off the station wagon owner.
 I offered to split the pay off.
 Cliff and I postponed our move to San Francisco and went looking for work, which we found at Coffee Dan's restaurant in Grossmont Center, a mall we could see from the front yard of my mom's hilltop home.
 I was a pot washer six days a week, a split shift, 10-2 and 6-10.
 Sundays and late evenings I played with Liz.

He was angry again.
 “Frey.” “What?” “Do you remember the last time you used a spell?” I recalled the smell of burning flesh as the maps cut into my palms.
 “Yes,” I muttered, defeated.
 The look he gave Ruby was clear.
 There would be no magic study for me.
 But I did know she had it.
 Maybe I’ll be able to steal it… Lost in thought, I began to fall behind the group.
 The higher we rose up the mountain, the more treacherous the jagged rock became.
 I felt every step, holding tight as the horse’s hooves slipped and jumped.
 The haze thickened, keeping the view both ahead and behind close.

In time, her strength would return, but she doubted the necromancer would give her a day to rest.
 She used a bit of the magic she did have left to summon her staff.
 If she were to die, she would die fighting any way she knew how.
 The man in black paused, extended his hands, and began to cast.
 He would give her no chance to strike.
 A blade stabbed his side.
 Velixar whirled, his speed far beyond any mortal.
 He stepped past Felewen’s slash and slammed a hand against her chest.
 Dark magic poured in.
 Her arms and legs arched backward, her sword fell from her hand, and her mouth opened in a single, aching shriek.

“Actually the topic did come up,” said Doi’van with a chuckle like rocks in a land slide.
 “While guards are usually not allowed in, it is not unusual for close friends or advisors to go in with some of those of the blood; to share their wisdom on the best possible greater sigils to take on.” “I will assume,” said Rodregas, “that they had never heard of a Nymph entering the chamber, much less one of the Hellborn?” “AElves are not uncommon and actually more Orqui than I expected.
 One servant thought that Nymphs used to go in during his father’s, father’s time, but not any time recently.
 No one could even imagine a Hellborn going into the Chamber,” agreed Doi’van.
 “Well as far behind as we are, we might not even get the chance to try to bully our way in,” Rodregas said.
 Doi’van nodded and that comment seemed to end the conversation.
 As Rodregas headed out to the sands of the Cathedral arena for the jousting match, he was relieved to see Imeralda waiting at the entrance to talk to him.
 She had been out all night on her mission.
 “Well, I have to say I am very tired of talking so I will make this quick,” she said with her normal sunny smile.
 Rodregas had to admit she did look tired.

I had no choice but to muster the courage to talk to her.
 Her reception was cool.
 Her name was Lisa and she was there to meet her friend who happened to be dating the bartender (who I knew well) so that was a good angle for me to work.
 I was doing pretty well getting to know her when a couple of girls I knew (and who I had hit on earlier) decided to have a little fun and disrupt my progress with this stunning lady.
 The two girls leaned in, their long dark hair flowing down and draping over each of my shoulders.
 They began whispering some very descriptive suggestions in my ears as they stroked their fingers through my hair.
 I can dual task with the best of them, but the offer I was getting in my ears conflicted with the vision across the table.
 I didn’t take my eyes off of Lisa but that wasn’t enough to keep the target of my affections seated while I was being propositioned by two beautiful brunettes.
 Lisa stood abruptly, looked rightfully angry and simply said, “It looks like you are busy,” and walked away.
 I thought my chances of getting her phone number were gone forever as she gathered up her girlfriend and left.

 Jim – Um, Truman Show, cameras, Eugene not being allowed to be adopted.
 Yeah, what the hell?
 Why aren’t we allowed to adopt him?
 Johnny – Well Eugene’s father’s attorney found some obscure law that said that Gene could never be adopted by anyone while the father was still alive.
 Jim – That’s it?
 Johnny – Yep, the judge ruled in favor of Gene’s father.
 As long as he’s alive Gene needs his permission to be adopted by anyone.

The comprehensive conceptual model needs to be complemented by the development of models for employment, food, education, trade and other fields that go beyond the national or sectoral approach to show the impact of the complex interactions that are key determinants of the development process – for instance, the impact of democracy on agriculture and of increasing agricultural productivity on employment, industrialization and trade, the impact of rising education on democratization, social tolerance for diversity, personal expectations and social stability.
 Once formulated, these conceptual models need to be applied under a variety of conditions to test their validity and demonstrate the value of a comprehensive approach to development.
 Therefore, we have proposed that the UN adopt a number of districts in different regions of the world, including crime-ridden inner cities or impoverished rural areas in industrial countries, to evolve and apply strategies for their rapid transition to a higher level of development.
 Six Goals in Education
 Once formulated, this knowledge needs to be imparted through education.
 Education is the greatest known civilizing force and the single most powerful lever for human development.
 Training imparts skills, but education increases the capacity of the individual at a more basic level, making the mind more active and alert, converting physical energy into mental energy, training us to see things from a wider perspective, to question and challenge the status quo, to think and imagine, to innovate and invent, to make decisions for ourselves and to act on our own initiative.
 Education is the process by which society passes on the accumulated knowledge and experience of countless centuries to new generations in a systematic, concentrated and abridged form, so that today’s young people can start their lives at the high point of knowledge and wisdom attained by preceding generations.
 Education replaces the slow, subconscious process of trial and error learning with a swift, conscious process.
 This accumulated knowledge is a great power that can be utilized to accelerate human development and abridge the time needed for society to arrive at progressively higher levels of material, social and psychological fulfilment.

I’d show them dark magic.
 I’d learn and go back… But how?
 How could I learn without a teacher?
 Chevelle.
 The fire died as I thought of the concern he’d shown me in the clearing, the tender moment we’d shared.
 With one word, the flames caught again, burning with a vengeance through the field.
 Watcher.
 None of it had been real.
 He was a watcher, he’d volunteered to watch me, to keep me in line.
 So I’d teach myself, take the risk and learn the magic without guidance.

Rick would know.
 She felt queer walking out in these clothes, but after having seen how women of this decade dressed, she knew she'd draw more attention in her Egyptian-motif dress than in this outfit.
 "Rick," she said, drawing his attention away from the people browsing in the store, "is this what they're supposed to look like?"
 His eyes grew big as he stared at her.
 The jeans revealed slender thighs, smoothly rounded hips, and, as she turned just a bit, a perfectly shaped little derriere.
 He started to reply to her question but found he had to clear his throat before he could speak.
 "You look great."
 "Really?
 Are they supposed to be this tight?"
 "That's-that's the style."

He watched her play for a couple of minutes and then headed back toward the blanket.
 Marie ran after him.
 "Don't you want to play?"
 she asked, clinging to his arm.
 "No."
 She could tell he was angry.
 "What's wrong?"
 "Nothing."
 He dropped onto the blanket.
 "Yes, there is."

I couldn’t see myself in the mirror.
 There was still hope but, damn, it was spinning too fast.
 It seemed like every fucking day something was happening that you had to respond to, you know?
 To not respond was to be dead, to be irrelevant.
 “Won’t you please come to Chicago just to sing?” you know?
 I thought, yeah, I could, I could.
 But, in the end, I didn’t, I didn’t do a fucking thing.
 I couldn’t.
 I Salingered myself, dad, I put myself away for my own good.
 And music, how did music get so tangled in with politics?

Poor Elfreda, sitting alone in the weeds, couldn’t even make grass grow.
 What can we do to help her?
 We should have a Council meeting on it, I’m sure.
 Poor, poor thing.
 I stayed where I sat, forcing my eyes to the ground.
 But then I pictured the smirk on her face as she mocked me to the villagers, to Council, and couldn’t stop the resentment from boiling up.
 My ears rang with it.
 “Choo!” I glanced up at Evelyn through the jagged line of my bangs.
 “A… a… choo!” she wheezed.
 Elves didn’t sneeze.

 The two traveled over the gentle hills, only the rough gasps of Qurrah’s breathing breaking the silence.
 As the two neared the village, Harruq dared to speak.
 “Qurrah,” he asked, “who is this Velixar?”
 “He is a teacher,” the half-orc whispered in between ragged breaths.
 “One wiser than I ever thought possible.”
 “So we’ll do what he says?
 We’ll kill the village, all of them, without reason?”
 Qurrah stopped their progress by turning and placing his hands on his brother’s shoulders.

"What about you, mister superhero shape shifter?
 You've been up longer than I have.
 I'm not the only one who needs to sleep."
 I tried not to let my voice get too sing-song, but I felt a completely irrational thrill as he quietly crossed over to my side of the room.
 "That's actually one of the benefits of my condition.
 I don't actually need normal amounts of sleep.
 An hour or two per night is usually more than enough."
 Having him so close to me was somehow both exhilarating and soothing at the same time.
 I could feel the tense, knotty parts of me start to relax for the first time since Simon and Nathanial tried to kill me.
 As exhaustion started to finally eat through all of the nervous energy that'd been fueling me, it was all I could do to follow what Alec was saying.

We saw fevered children out in the cold, begging on street-corners after midnight.
 I tripped over a dead fellow.
 In the bars, we saw girls get used by both men and farm animals.
 A few times we rode in taxis to motels where prostitutes greeted us.
 We would barter, object to the price, and leave while the coarser of them screeched obscenities.
 Some cabbies, after three or four such stops, stoically delivered us back downtown.
 Others pulled up beside a gang of thugs.
 Then we ran for our lives.
 The night Eric joined us, so did big Mike Beatty.
 He was about 6’6”, 280 pounds.

By the time the actual dance arrives, everyone who is anyone will have a date, most of them picked out by the girl weeks before the boy even started thinking about the dance."
 There wasn't really any bitterness in her voice, but there was something, maybe the same kind of longing I felt when I talked about Prom.
 "You're probably right.
 That would fit with what I know of Britney so far."
 "Do you need us to give you a ride?"
 I looked over and saw that James was once again glaring at me, somehow having approached to within a few feet without making any noise.
 "I should probably make sure she isn't waiting somewhere for me.
 That's probably half of why she's so mad.
 I was so out of things yesterday I didn't think to let her know I was headed home with you."
 Rachel looked for a moment like she wanted to disagree, but she nodded, in the kind of noncommittal way people use when they don't really agree, but are ready to let you make your own mistakes.

Even her natural fear of having walked into the future was more often than not suppressed by her sense of adventure.
 He wanted to protect her, now and in the past.
 When he was sure she was asleep, he went to his own room and took out the pages he'd copied before his sister’s dance.
 Marie Tranton, born 1904 .
 .
 .
 It didn't tell the date of her death.
 That was odd--he was sure it had been in this section.
 His heart began racing as he scanned those pages.
 There was no mention at all of her death--or of her marriage.

Education is the process by which society passes on the accumulated knowledge and experience of countless centuries to new generations in a systematic, concentrated and abridged form, so that today’s young people can start their lives at the high point of knowledge and wisdom attained by preceding generations.
 Education replaces the slow, subconscious process of trial and error learning with a swift, conscious process.
 This accumulated knowledge is a great power that can be utilized to accelerate human development and abridge the time needed for society to arrive at progressively higher levels of material, social and psychological fulfilment.
 Despite the massive efforts of international institutions to create awareness of the vital role of education in peace, democracy, economic development, population control and environmental protection, progress on extending the benefits of education to all humankind is still grossly inadequate.
 In 1990, 948 million people or about 20 per cent of the entire world population lacked even basic literacy skills.
 Adult literacy rates in the least developed nations still average less than 50 per cent and are less than half that in a number of countries.
 Unless more intensive efforts are made, worldwide the absolute number of the illiterate will decline only marginally by the year 2000.
 Illiteracy is likely to increase by 10 per cent in South Asia – home to more than 40 per cent of the world’s illiterate – and by nearly 7 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa.
 Although universal primary education has been a goal for decades and primary education has been made compulsory in most countries, 128 million children living in remote rural areas, urban slums and refugee camps – representing 20 per cent of the total school-age population – are still excluded from primary education.
 Unless greater measures are introduced, this number may rise to more than 160 million by the turn of the century.

Acceptance of the viewer, combined with an obvious desire to mend grievous hurts.
 It was exactly how I remembered feeling.
 My questing eyes finally found the last, missing piece.
 There was the gratitude.
 Misplaced on her perfect face.
 Wrong on the features of someone who couldn't possibly need help from a mere mortal, but still there.
 "It's so beautiful.
 I don't know what to say.
 Are you sure you want to give it up?"
 Alec looked back up at me, and his eyes were filled with incredible need.

The council had sent trackers—the pair Chevelle had choked and released, and the other, the broken, limp corpse in the clearing by the ridge.
 We had killed him.
 And they were worried about my stupid binding?
 The circling cloaks from my dreams were back, filling my head.
 My thoughts were twisting, getting out of control.
 They’d be hunting us all down now.
 They would kill us.
 That was why I needed training.
 To protect myself.
 Because they intended to kill me, not capture.

I wondered if this was fiction, a fairy ruse, given to Chevelle by Ruby.
 Or maybe the dust was still playing havoc on me.
 I glanced over my shoulder at Ruby where she watched anxiously out the front window.
 I shook my head, finding the line again…
 But I couldn’t deny it.
 Their size was about that of an elf, but all were different.
 The men were thicker.
 Not necessarily with muscle, some more bulbous.
 The women were varied as well, some thin and wiry, some stout like the males.
 Their hair was in all shades—light blond like the sun, brown as the trees, one even had rusty red, his plump cheeks peppered with light brown spots.

 He doesn’t need porn.

A large number of rectangular tables were scattered about the room, situated so that the two people sitting at them would feel relatively isolated.
 As I continued my survey, I realized that there was only ever one pile of books at any given table, and in the few instances in which two people were sitting at a table, one of the individuals was obviously explaining something to the other one.
 Most of the kids looked fairly run-of-the-mill.
 There was even the expected contingent of jocks, obviously there just because a coach or parent had delivered some kind of ultimatum.
 Britney predictably headed over and staked out a table as close as she could get to a group of girls who were probably cheerleaders.
 Clustered around the other end of the room were the more studious kids, the kind who were generally pretty smart, but for whatever reason were struggling with math.
 I wasn't surprised to see a kind of a no-man's-land between the two ends of the spectrum.
 I was startled to see that the middle ground was inhabited by an attractive girl a year or two younger than me.
 Left to my own devices, I would've normally picked a table over on the nerd end of the room, but I found myself relating more to the girl stuck in the middle.
 She looked up and met my gaze for just a second before ducking back down and concentrating on her homework.

I dropped my bag near the door and walked over to the kitchen table.
 My mom had placed a full plate of eggs and toast on the table; I sat down and started to eat.
 My mom hurried over and glanced at her watch.
 “You have about a half an hour until you have to leave.
 Eat up.” I responded with a quick shovel of food.
 Within 25 minutes, I was standing by the door with my stomach all queasy.
 My mom rushed forward and gave me a quick hug.
 “Be careful now and enjoy yourself!” “Right I will…” I said uneasily.
 No doubt that I was going to be very careful indeed.
 I stepped outside and the door closed behind me.

Sometimes I’m grateful for the fire witch’s seduction.
 He was grieving so hard…” His expression lost all trace of its usual cockiness as he brought back the memory.
 “Her enchantments numbed him.
 Then, when he woke from them, the tragedy gave him purpose.” A shadow of his smile returned as he looked away.
 “The irony is her tragedy gave root to the idea—” “Frey.” Chevelle was suddenly standing between us.
 I gaped up at him, the trance of Steed’s words broken.
 “Huh?” “Time to go.” There was anger in his voice.
 I didn’t know what I had done, but I stood obediently.
 Chevelle pulled me away from Steed.
 “I’ll take her,” Ruby offered.

Alec was standing in the doorway, having crossed the distance down the hall faster than I would've believed possible, appearing almost as if by sorcery.
 His shoes were every bit as shiny as James', leading up to slacks that could've been mistaken for shiny, but were actually something else, something with more depth than anything I'd seen before.
 The coat was made out of the same material, tailored tightly enough it managed to emphasize rather than conceal his massive shoulders and chest.
 His pocket square matched his bow-tie, both of which were the exact shade of green used on my dress.
 It wasn't a masculine color by almost any standard, but he made it his, and there wasn't anything about him that could be described as anything other than manly.
 Having stalled as long as I could, I finally looked up past his perfect lips and met his twinkling eyes.
 A smile tugged at the corner of his mouth as he walked towards me, and it wasn't until he stopped and held out his hand that I realized it hadn't been empty this whole time.
 "Rachel said you needed some shoes."
 While I was still struggling to get thoughts to coalesce into words, Alec smoothly went down onto one knee, and picked up my left foot.
 The work of art he slipped onto my foot was so beautiful I felt bad letting it touch the ground.

Not back to the way it had originally been, because he knew she wouldn't have married Davis.
 Would she?
 She would have been lonely and vulnerable when she'd gone back.
 Could Davis have won her back?
 Although he knew it would be torture, he went to his desk and dug out the pages about her.
 He scanned them for the information he wanted.
 Born 1904, daughter of Jefferson Tranton, one brother .
 .
 .
 The pages hadn't changed since the last time he'd read them.

But the elf was not close enough, and he was more skilled with a bow than in just firing arrows.
 He snapped the wood up, cracking Antonil across the bottom of his hand, which held firm to his blade.
 Undaunted, the elf stepped closer, ducked underneath the guard captain’s return swing, and then kicked at the arrow still lodged in his shin, finally making Antonil drop his blade.
 The elf stood, drawing an arrow as he did.
 Antonil, now lying on the ground, struggled to bring his shield over his chest.
 Part of it caught beneath his side and would not come.
 He would not be able to block in time.
 A loud wooden crash stole away the elf’s focus.
 The door to the home behind him exploded into splinters as a huge projectile shot through it.
 The elf spun, his eyes widening as he saw what had shattered the door: a massacred elven body.

I rose above, peering down at myself, and the image turned into my mother, the dark water going black, the ripples transforming to wind.
 I recognized the scene as her pendant began to glow, the wind howling, screams piercing my ears.
 It was the same dream, but different now.
 I glanced around to find a village I didn’t know.
 Someone was coming toward me, an expression of fear and sadness on his handsome face.
 His familiar face.
 He reached out to me and I stepped toward him, tears streaming down my cheeks.
 He wrapped his arms around me as I turned again to see my mother.
 A howl of rage escaped her and I started to go to her, but he held me.
 He was restraining me.

He drove her to Boston’s finest dress shop, sitting down to smoke and read the newspaper as she tried on clothes.
 "What do you think?"
 she asked, turning slowly in front of him.
 "Very nice."
 "But do you really like it?
 I don't have anything this color, but I like it."
 It was called blue lotus and was the predominant color in an Egyptian motif.
 She and her mother had attended a fashion show two weeks ago, and she'd loved the Egyptian patterns on the mannequins who'd modeled them.
 But the mannequins were thin women, and although she was slender, she had too many curves to be fashionable.
 Binding her breasts helped a little, but it was hard to hide her hips and derriere.

“You saw nothing,” this second half-orc said to him before following the warrior.
 Antonil struggled to his feet, shaking his head all the while.
 “It keeps getting stranger,” he muttered.
 He took a step and immediately regretted it.
 As his leg throbbed, he yanked the arrow out.
 His armor had kept it from penetrating too deeply, the barbs unable to latch onto any soft flesh.
 Of course it still hurt like the abyss, but he could deal with that.
 What he could not deal with, however, was how few in number his soldiers had become.
 More than four of his own men lay dead around him, joined by three dead elves, five if he counted the two the half-orc had thrown through the doorway.
 A good ratio considering the skill of the elves, but not good enough.

 Men he had trained were dying, and for what?
 “I have honored your will, my lord,” he said.
 “But it is time I honor my men.”
 From his belt, he took a white horn bearing the symbol of Neldar.
 He put this ancient horn to his lips and blew.
 All throughout Woodhaven rumbled the signal to retreat.

The recognizable lines of toad dwarfs marched around the trees, and I could tell they were up to no good again.
 They were really starting to get on my nerves.
 Looks like I wasn’t sleeping after all.
 Chapter 3
 Sneaking out after hours isn’t easy, especially at Emily’s house.
 Her parents aren’t sound sleepers.
 If we weren’t really careful, they’d wake up and then we’d have some answering to do.
 And I don’t think they’d understand our reason.
 I followed Emily down the stairs, in our pajamas, to the door.
 We were careful not to make a sound but I listened closely to the sound of her dad snoring.

She stood right in front of its head and opened her mouth, bizarre sounds started coming out.
 We all stood there mesmerized as she grunted, growled, snorted and hissed at the dragon.
 I expected it to just take a huge bite out of her, but it seemed as surprised as we were.
 “Emily, what's going on?” I shouted to her and started to walk over.
 Seth reached out and grabbed my arm.
 I spun around, suddenly annoyed.
 He shook his head and nodded over to the dragon.
 I looked and to my surprise it was bending down to let Emily stroke its head.
 She patted its head and it curled up outside the cave.
 She bent down to whisper something in its ear and then stood up again.

I wasn't sure I was ready for the other things he was starting to imply.
 Chapter 20 There were a couple of times between Monday and the end of the week where I didn't think I was going to survive having to worry about whether or not I'd be able to sneak out to Brandon's party.
 My dreams had taken a decidedly odd turn.
 I'd had the lucid, vivid dreams every single night, but my guilty conscience seemed to be working overtime.
 At least that was all I could assume.
 I woke up flustered, with vague memories of Alec.
 My best guess was that I was trying to defend myself after having argued with his little sister.
 If I was going to waste my time in the vivid dreams, it would've made more sense to spend them trying to explain my side of what'd happened to Rachel, but apparently I wasn't normal enough for that.
 I'd been all set to swallow my pride and thank Alec for shutting up the two kids sitting behind me.
 Only that'd been before the ride home all by myself on the bus while he sped home in his little luxury car.

The two rushed past the elaborate elven homes toward the sound of combat.
 They kept to the back alleys, and because of this, they met their first target: three elves fleeing toward them, hoping to use the lesser-known pathways to avoid the overwhelming numbers of their opponent.
 “Bring them down,” the necromancer said.
 “With pleasure,” Harruq said.
 He raised his blades and charged.
 The closest elf realized the half-orc was an enemy and cried warning before rushing ahead, his longsword ready.
 “Come on, pansy-boy,” the half-orc warrior roared.
 The two collided in a brutal exchange of steel.
 The elf shoved his sword upward, using his forward momentum to slam the point straight at Harruq’s throat.
 Harruq swung Condemnation left, deflecting the incoming thrust.

What if, while Eric lay comatose, he was given once more the choice to live, as I'm coming to believe he was given the choice before leaving for the desert in Kenny’s mom’s Volkswagen?
 If Kenny were still alive, I would ask him to describe, as best his memory would serve him, Eric’s expression and voice when he insisted they leave without Billy and me.
 The Bible implies that Jesus, had he been a less than perfect, could have chosen another fate than crucifixion.
 Only he chose trust his father’s will above his own, which was limited by his humanity, as ours is, in spades.
 Maybe twice, at least, Eric chose to die for me.
 Still, because Eric didn’t create himself, to worship him would be like praising Hamlet rather than Shakespeare.
 Besides, if Eric died for me, it probably wasn’t the human in him, but the Christ.
 So I will take care not to worship Eric, only adore him.
 I wonder if I have been stricken by acute anthropomorphism.
 Maybe I should give up watching my Joan of Arcadia CD collection.

 This was in Memphis?
 BG:  	Yeah, nine weeks, that’s fairly serious to be locked up.
 Well, sort of locked up.
 I mean, I could have left.
 There were no bars or anything.
 But, I had no will, I had no good reason to do anything.
 Lorelei would just sit with me and we’d talk about small things, you know, what it was like outside, what she was reading, some painting she was doing.

The scene was awful and I had to prevent myself from throwing up.
 Then I knew why they beat and killed him.
 All the other dwarves were on Kojas.
 This dwarf must have betrayed Kojas to bring information to whoever “her majesty” was and to help us into Igneeria.
 I suddenly knew that this dwarf was much braver than we had given him credit for.
 I suddenly felt awful because I knew who the thing was.
 Kojas.
 Chapter 7
 “The little traitor thought he could fool us,” Kojas announced, “but he was wrong.
 His death does not matter to me but what matters is what he could have said and done against us.

Tiny Netherlands, with the highest population density in the world, produces more than sufficient food to feed itself and remain a large net food exporter.
 Currently 11 per cent of the world’s land surface is used for agricultural crops, just 4 per cent more than in 1960.
 A comprehensive theoretical study of soils, climate, vegetation and topography conducted in 1975 indicated that both land and water utilized for agriculture could be doubled, if necessary, and that the earth could support 36 times the 1975 level (18 times the 1990 level) of cereal production using the same share of cultivated land.
 There would be severe practical obstacles to such a vast expansion of croplands, but these findings suggest that physical limitations to food production are not the primary constraints.
 A more commonly accepted estimate indicates that the world’s land and water used for agriculture could more than double.
 Agriculture’s Dual Role
 Achieving food security necessitates increasing food production and employment opportunities.
 Agriculture plays a dual role in the abolition of hunger – it produces the food and it can also produce a great many of the jobs needed by households to buy food in developing countries.
 Since agriculture is the world’s single largest employer, raising production and productivity in this sector can immediately place additional purchasing power in the hands of the rural poor, who will in turn utilize the additional income for purchasing more food, clothing and other basic consumer goods that will create more jobs and higher incomes for countless others.
 The increased agricultural produce becomes raw material for a wide range of agro-based industries and services that stimulate formation of new enterprises, and create downstream jobs as well as products for further processing, domestic sale or export.

“They will join my army.
 Two thousand I now have.
 We are close.
 So close.
 Soon we will have enough to crush Veldaren.”
 “Where is this army?”
 Velixar flashed an ugly smile.
 “They are with me always.”
 As if this very comment brought forth their existence, thousands of decaying, mindless beings surrounded them.
 “How can you command so many?” Qurrah gasped.

.
 Even as she thought it, she opened her mouth a bit.
 Rick's tongue darted inside.
 And the flame that it created shot through her entire body, surprising her with its power and heat.
 Her body ached with a pleasure that seemed too intense to bear.
 Intoxicated, she wrapped her arms around Rick’s neck, moaning.
 Powerfully aroused by that moan, Rick slid one hand down her back to press her closer.
 She shuddered with pleasure as he began kissing her neck.
 He undid the first button on her dress.
 "I want you, Marie," he rasped, raising his head to look into her eyes.

He could not move.
 The pegasi were closer.
 They were readying their bows.
 He had to speak!
 “Can you feel it?” the man in black asked.
 “Can you feel your heart shudder and throb?
 Here, let me help your pain.”
 Dieredon lay on his back, staring up at him.
 His chest was a mess of pain, his mind light and dizzy.
 As Velixar reached down, his maggoty face smiling and his hand dripping unholy magic, a wave of arrows rained upon him.

Let ‘em sue.
 Yeah, it’s just a single right.
 At first we were gonna do it on Frank’s Straight label but he was going through some business hassles at the time.
 So it came out on Laughing Buddha Jesus Phallus, this really underground Frisco label, started, I think, by Dino Valenti.
 Maybe not.
 Anyway, we did this heavy piece as a kind of lark—I was pissed, I admit by all the dismissals I was getting in the rock press, all the accusations of sell-out.
 So I did this little 45, this really wild piece of music—that’s a Stratocaster I’m playing but filtered through this mini-moog that Underwood brought with him.
 And damned if it wasn’t a hit.
 We didn’t even have a back for it, you know, a flipside.
 So I quickly wrote “Stately Plump Buck Mulligan” as a 12-bar blues, and we sort of adlibbed it in the studio.

“All the time.
 I’m known for it, in fact.
 Harruq Tun, trainer of elves, slayer of dragons, and man of the ladies.”
 “Please.” She rolled her eyes.
 “Not this lady.”
 “Never said you were one, elfie.”
 Aurelia gave Harruq a brutal glare.
 “And why not?”
 He picked at some grass and said nothing.
 “Well?” she asked.

"You make me feel like a princess," she murmured, rubbing her face against his neck.
 "Too bad."
 "`Too bad'?"
 She raised her head to look at him in surprise.
 "Yeah.
 I want to make you feel like a queen."
 "Oh."
 Smiling, she laid her head on his shoulder, relishing his tight embrace.
 He was every bit as much a dream as Hollywood.

 "Stop being so nice to me," she sobbed into his shoulder.
 "What?"
 he asked, bending his head closer to hers.
 "Stop being so nice to me!"
 He frowned.
 "You don't want me to be nice to you?"
 "No."
 She sat up and held out her hand for his handkerchief.
 He gave it to her.

Each new day was something unexpected, and the trip became less daunting than it might have otherwise been.
 I was moving every moment of light, and so exhaustion pulled me into sleep every moment of darkness.
 I concentrated on each step, breathing in the new scents, counting trees, anything I could to keep myself on task and the past out of mind.
 I was counting fallen catclaw seeds when I crested another hill and spotted a bridge in the valley.
 I hesitated, slowly making my way down.
 A bridge might mean a village was nearby, and a village meant elves.
 I didn’t want to get caught, not after all this, so I was fully prepared to run by the time I reached the crossing.
 Its stacked gray stones were bulkier than those that had been appearing more frequently on my path.
 Water flowed beneath, smoothing the stones at the base.
 They were so worn, it must have been in place for centuries.

Rodregas then went back to the dungeon level and opened the opposite door and then the Dire Cats’ prison door and watched.
 He had expected them to either bolt for it or stay in the “safety” of their room.
 Instead they both casually got up and walked out, as if they were guests in a fancy inn, with all the time in the world.
 As they walked out the door both cats gave him a casual glance as he held the two doors firmly closed together bracing for the weight if they threw themselves at the doors, but they just walked by and headed up the stairs.
 He wanted to follow, but Rodregas held himself back patiently waiting until it was safe.
 They might look like lions, but he knew they were smarter than any beast, and they could be setting him up.
 Finally after waiting what seemed like forever, but was probably only about twenty minutes, Rodregas slowly made his way back up through the keep.
 When he poked his head out the entrance there was no sign of Dire Cats or chickens, but he did note a few stray feathers in the courtyard.
 Other than a few alarmed sounds from the chicken coop, it was surprisingly quiet.
 Rodregas felt a feeling of relief at the idea that the lions had eaten.

“You’re guessing.”
 “I have also seen your brother meeting the strange man in black of the ever- changing face.
 What is his name, Harruq?
 What is it he offers you?”
 “You’re out of your mind.”
 The tip buried in deeper.
 The elf lowered his face so the fury in his eyes was all Harruq could see.
 “Yes, I am out of my mind.
 I will let you live.
 Until Aurelia sees you for what you are, I will spare your life.

He smiled, taking her hand and squeezing it.
 "But it's such a beautiful day.
 Why don't we go out for lunch and then see a movie?"
 "Wonderful!"
 They went to a small restaurant for soup and sandwiches.
 "This is good," she said after swallowing a spoonful of clam chowder.
 "Do you have it in 1927?"
 "Yes--it's one of my favorites."
 "What don't you have?"
 She laughed.

Liz was a beauty.
 We dated a few times before the prom, and she would've preferred that I give Karen notice and take her instead.
 But I was neither that cold-blooded nor that stuck on Liz.
 She might be as pretty, but if she possessed any goodness like what I saw in Karen, she hid it deep.
 Prom night, for reasons more complicated than I can remember so long, Cliff was driving a '49 Ford convertible that belonged to Bob Williams, whom I will visit in Portland a few days from now.
 Cliff's date was Chris Latin.
 Karen and I rode in the back seat.
 Karen had a cold.
 Maybe her reason for keeping her distance, physical and otherwise, was hygienic concern for my health.
 Or maybe she didn't approve of my dating Liz.

There's something I need to ask you."
 "Why didn't you just call?"
 "It's too important for that."
 He took her hand, gazing into her eyes as he raised it to his lips.
 "Let's go inside."
 They sat down on the sofa, and Rick held both her hands in his as he faced her.
 "I love you, Marie.
 I love you more than I've ever loved anyone in my life.
 I want-I want to spend the rest of my life with you."
 He released her hands to reach into his pocket for a small box.

Brandon eventually lost his interest in youth sports and had no interest in golf.
 He did, however, love hot rods.
 He was intrigued by my high school hot rod so we found the same make, model and year of car in horrible condition.
 The only positive comment Lisa could make was, “at least it runs.” I taught both of my boys to drive a stick shift on this beat up Chevelle before my eldest and I began to take it completely apart in an attempt to restore this classic car to its original condition with a hot rod twist.
 The deeper we dug into it, the more rust and damage we found.
 There were so many holes rusted through the bottom we could see the garage floor through the trunk.
 We removed every wire, rubber seal, window felt, and had boxes full of zip-lock baggies that were marked with a Sharpie what the part was and where it had come from.
 When Brandon was about fifteen, we went to Hot August Nights in Reno, a huge hot rod auto show.
 We wandered through these aisles of incredible cherry vehicles and talked about how someday ours could be alongside these beauties.
 This project would prove to be a huge challenge that would last seven-plus years, partly because it coincided with the start of Brandon’s drug use.

This increase is partially explained by the fact that more than 100 new sovereign nations have emerged, many of which were protected, prior to independence, by the colonial powers that have now withdrawn.
 The acquisition of even modest defensive capabilities may consume a significant portion of national income when the economic base is small, as it is for many of these nations.
 In addition, the increasing incidence of war, terrorism and drug-related violence in the developing world has heightened the sense of insecurity among these countries.
 However, a closer analysis reveals that half of the military expenditure of the developing world is incurred by a small number of oil-exporting countries in the Middle East and North Africa, and another quarter is incurred by other high-income developing nations, mostly in East and South East Asia – whereas the 84 developing nations with lower and lower-middle incomes, including such large nations as China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Bangladesh, comprising 72 per cent of the world’s population, incur roughly 6 per cent of global military expenditure, on average less than 3 per cent of the total GDP of these countries.
 International pressure for defining acceptable levels of military expenditure and reducing defence budgets is entirely warranted, provided that it is applied equitably to all countries, takes into account the varying conditions between regions and nations, and places corresponding limitations on arms exports by industrialized nations.
 Placed under the control of an impartial international agency specialized in security issues, rather than being left to development banks or made an instrument of bilateral policy by donor nations, these measures could effect a further 50 to 75 per cent cut in global defence spending and thereby generate $400 billion to $600 billion per year for non-military purposes, equal to roughly ten times current levels of overseas development assistance.
 The international community should commit itself to a minimum goal of reducing global military expenditure to $400 billion (in 1992 constant dollars) by 2000 AD.
 Military expenditure mitigates but does not resolve the underlying problem of security.
 Today, the most pressing security threats are social, not military.
 The appropriate response to them is greater investment in sustainable human development, not more arms.

Understanding came slowly.
 He had shot lightning from his hands.
 The others nodded appreciatively, but I was having second thoughts about friendship with this man.
 Though not being his friend was probably more dangerous.
 I was shaking my head in disbelief as he turned back to me and bowed.
 He stepped back, taking a seat as the wiry man stepped inside the circle then.
 He nodded to me.
 Grey.
 He was thoughtful for a moment, deciding the best way to display his skill, before finally approaching to offer his hand.
 I reached forward, placing my palm against his, and then he was gone.

And from the character comes the destiny.” Stupefied by stress as I was, I sat a while wondering where on that continuum I should start trouble-shooting, until the obvious made itself clear.
 Start with the spirit.
 So, I thought, what could best set my spirit on the right path?
 I believe it was God who sent the message: "Look here, you're a writer.
 But for months you haven't been writing, which has grieved your spirit into a coma.
 Sure, teaching nine classes and raising kids is hard, but it’s not going to kill you.
 What will kill you is not writing.” The next morning, I got up at 5 a.m. instead of 5:30, which allowed me to write for a half hour.
 Not much, but enough to give me hope, which is the antidote to despair.
 The stuff I wrote during those half-hour sessions became crucial parts of my novel The Loud Adios.
 About a month after the semester ended, I sent the manuscript to a national contest.

I wanted to say something about being an artist, a struggling artist, how it’s hard to even say what you mean, half the time.
 I don’t know.
 Some of that is in that song.
 The line about the maple tree is McClure’s.
 I don’t really like the arrangement we came up with for this song.
 I don’t think the backup guys were up to it.
 I should have played everything—I almost went back in and re-cut it, but, hell, it’s ok the way it is.
 But, it could have been better.

Instead, he looked like it was… endearing.
 He stood and walked over to me, taking my hand to help me up.
 When he touched me, I tried to fight the heat that ran up my neck.
 I couldn’t and embarrassment caused my cheeks to color as well.
 I peered up at him through my now-dark bangs and could have sworn it amused him.
 I laughed at myself.
 The silly romance I’d been reading in the diary must have been affecting me.
 I tried to stop my thoughts from returning there as we practiced, but it was near impossible.
 He kept working close with me, touching me.
 I knew I should have been focusing on the magic, but it was useless.

When she merely glanced up at him and quickened her pace, he caught her arm.
 "I'm sorry--don't be mad.
 I'll buy you some frozen yogurt.
 That'll make you feel better."
 She gave him a small smile, but when they reached the yogurt stand, she said that she didn't want any.
 She was quiet during the ride home, and after a few attempts to draw her into conversation, he left her alone, unable to figure out what was bothering her.
 "Do you want to watch TV?"
 he asked when they got home.
 "Yes--no.

But whether he believes or not, Cliff has gotten well blessed since our evening with Billy Graham.
 He has four wonderful kids, and Toni, who is one of those rarest of people who appear to grow brighter, stronger, and more beautiful every year.
 Cliff and Billy's dad, Cliff Senior, invited me to dinner not many years ago.
 The evening became an in vino veritas experience.
 After some cups, he said, “Ken, you should know it was me that hounded my son into serving in Vietnam.” I held back from saying, Yeah, I know.
 “So he goes over there, fighting in a war that was all wrong, and he saw things nobody should have to.
 He comes back drinking hard.
 And then, thank God, he met Toni.” The man from whom Cliff and Bill Torrey inherited their reserved and stoic characters snuffed and wiped his eyes.
 “I’ll tell you, that girl saved my son’s life.
 She dressed him down when he needed it, kicked him out when she knew it was best, and took him back as soon as he deserved it.

She's liked Ben for almost as long as I can remember.
 I think it all started when they both ended up at the school nurse together with broken bones due to 'falling down the stairs.'"
 I felt a shiver course through me at the thought of what Rachel was implying.
 Watching Jasmin twirl through moves that seemed to be a modification of East Coast Swing, it was hard to believe anyone so self-possessed could've had that kind of childhood.
 I thought about asking for more details, but it felt wrong, like reading someone else's e-mail.
 Besides, I was pretty sure Rachel would tell me it was Jasmin's story, and I'd just have to go to her with my questions.
 The music picked up slightly, and Jasmin and Alec sped up with it.
 They were moving so quickly now it almost seemed they were better than Isaac and Jessica.
 A quick visual search laid that question to rest though.
 I could just make out Isaac's towering form across the pavilion in the corner where they'd apparently gone to find room for some of their more impressive moves.

 I turned around from explaining for the fourth time to the third person why you couldn't prove congruence of two triangles with the nonexistent angle-angle-angle postulate, only to find that Britney had slipped out of the room.
 It was possible she'd just gone to the restroom.
 I tried to remind myself of all of the places she could be, and all of the reasons she might have left that didn't involve abandoning me here.
 Rachel met me on my way back to my table to gather up my books.
 "She left with Rick Anders."
 I mustered a grin.
 "Was my panic that obvious?"
 "No, I was just watching her to see who she had in her sights for the Ashure Day Dance.
 Then when I saw her leave I realized that would mean you wouldn't have a ride home."

The shift from manufacturing to services is a positive and inevitable expression of the elevation of human activity from the physical to the mental level, which is the central reason for the phenomenal rise in global living standards over the past century.
 Rich nations have become rich through a shift of workers from the primary farm sector to value-added, non-farm secondary and tertiary sectors.
 Poverty and hunger persist so long as a majority of the population depend upon the routine operations of farming for their livelihood.
 This is also the cause of the growing feminization of poverty in developing countries.
 Today’s developed nations arrived at their present position by a long, slow migration from agriculture to manufacturing to service sector, but that does not mean developing countries must follow the same path.
 The growing demand for services in the developed world coupled with rapid strides in telecommunications has created the possibility of skipping steps to abridge the development process.
 Even within developing countries, surging demand for education, health care, tourism, communication, financial and retail services has opened up opportunities that were available to the developed countries only at a much later stage in their development.
 Outsourcing: During the last decade enormous attention has been focused on the lucrative employment potentials generated by Information and Communication Technology (ICT), particularly the high paid jobs in computer software and hardware and the less technical jobs in business process outsourcing.
 Countries such as India have shown that they can leapfrog into the technological vanguard by developing qualified human resources to meet the ever-expanding shortage in these sectors.
 Information Technology and IT-enabled services stand out as the most important new fields of employment to emerge since the popularization of the automobile.

No kid until she passes her exams, I resolved.
 Last October, she passed them with distinction.
 The dissertation would take a year or two but, hoping she could read and write a little while pregnant and while caring for a baby, I suggested that now was the time, if ever.
 Sure, celebrities and other billionaires father kids when they’re ancient, but they can afford nannies who take screaming babies for walks in the park, and they can ship the kids off to boarding schools when as teenagers they metamorphose into demons.
 My big kids are great, and I mean great in the most literal sense.
 Darcy, the artist who could draw better at three years old than I could when she was three and I was thirty three, majored in painting and photography in college and graduated then worked as a newspaper designer but soon turned to teaching.
 She teaches fifth grade kids so underprivileged that not one in her last year’s class of twenty-seven had ever participated in an organized sport.
 She loves the kids, so she’s always developing some new method, like creating a bi-weekly newspaper and having them write columns on their favorite subjects or assigning them to design their dream house and using the assignment to teach basic geometry.
 In summer, at the Boy’s and Girl’s Club, she teaches art to teenagers, most of them troubled or in trouble.
 Darcy’s great because her giant’s heart is open and she uses her brains and imagination in generous ways.

Brandon shook his head and flashed another of his winning smiles, albeit one with an overtone of sympathy.
 "I'm sure it isn't as bad as that."
 I wanted to disagree, to go into detail about why my life had just taken a turn for the worse, but something about his manner was suddenly distant.
 I thought about calling him out on it, but with my life suddenly looking like I was all but friendless, that didn't seem like such a good idea.
 Without really meaning to I'd managed to alienate just about everyone at school.
 Brandon already had plenty of reasons not to be with me, it was the height of stupidity to give him any more.
 I could probably deal with not having a boyfriend, even assuming that was what we were right now.
 Going half a year without anyone to talk to because my mom was wrapped up with her art and everyone else in the town thought I was stuck-up would be more than I could take.
 The thought was enough to leave me speechless for the entire drive home.
 Brandon seemed content to leave me alone with my thoughts as he sped around the various turns at speeds that normally would've made me protest.

Mickey Mouse hadn't been around in 1927, and she found the whole idea of a fantasy land for children exciting.
 And she loved Splash Mountain.
 "Are you sad to be leaving?"
 Rick asked that evening as he watched her pack.
 "Yes.
 This has been a dream-come-true, and I'd like to stay in the dream."
 With a sigh she folded her baja and put it in her suitcase.
 He stood, placing his hands on her shoulders from behind.
 "If we get a chance, we'll come back."
 She turned around, gazing up at him anxiously.

"I'm sorry, I really wanted to go.
 More than anything, but I couldn't."
 "That's it?
 You aren't going to give any kind of real reason?
 I guess I should at least be glad you aren't going to lie to me.
 Unless you really didn't ever want to go, and were lying to me all along."
 Rachel shrank in on herself a little.
 It almost looked like she was going to cry, which should have made me feel bad, but I was too mad to care.
 I'd been miserable the whole way there, and especially the whole way back, and then she wanted to just pretend like none of it had happened.
 Rachel's lip trembled slightly as she finally managed to get a response out.

 "Yes," she whispered.
 "When-when Davis .

 put his tongue in-in my mouth, I didn't like it.
 But you--with you, I like it."
 She twisted her head about to kiss his throat.
 "I think about you all the time.
 I think about kissing you and touching you--with your shirt off."

While we don’t have time now to go over all the proof, the general thought is that mortals are truly just animals and don’t produce magic.
 It is only our connection to other realms that provides us power.
 Mana is the raw energy of magic no matter what its source.
 You can use mana from any source to cast spells.” He looked around at the three of them to make sure they understood.
 Rodregas felt like he was back in a classroom, as he had been as a child in the Cathedral of the Knights.
 In truth all three were very interested, as magic was something that was very much affecting their lives at the moment.
 Rodregas noticed that while Imeralda’s expression was one of simple enjoyment at refining her knowledge with an expert, Doi’van’s seemed almost made of rock.
 It seemed as if he feared that if he moved, his inclusion in the discussion would be challenged.
 Jordaan, apparently satisfied with their attention, continued “Our ability to manipulate the sources of mana seems to be a relationship of our blood connection to a realm.
 Mortals, to a greater or lesser extent; have an ability to tap into the mana that has overflowed into our realm from the Celestial, Infernal and Elemental Realms.

First she loaded the dishwasher while Rick supervised, and she poured in the soap and started the machine herself.
 After a shower, she had lessons on the use of the food processor, the blender, and--delight of delights--the microwave oven.
 "I can make lunch now," she proclaimed happily.
 "Do you like to cook?"
 "Yes."
 But her face fell.
 "To be honest, I don't know how.
 We have a cook.
 But I'd like to try."
 "OK.

Brandon worked more mockery into a simple clap than most of us could carry off with a full cast of supporting actors.
 "Always observing the old forms, aren't you, Alec.
 Well now it's time for a whole new batch."
 One second Brandon was a human, the next he was a huge monstrosity, a thing that normally dwelt in the bottom, most primitive parts of the mind, venturing out only to star prominently in nightmares.
 The rush of power beat back at our entire pack.
 If it'd been a physical wind it would've knocked me over.
 Intangible or not, it still staggered me and only my grip on Jasmin and Dom kept me from dropping to my knees.
 Alec stood motionless for a pair of seconds, and then seemed to explode and melt back into himself.
 I blinked, and his human body had been replaced with the hybrid form that'd saved my life once before.
 Only this time he wasn't fighting wolves, he was fighting another hybrid, and Brandon towered over him.

She took Marie's hand, squeezing it.
 "I don't know if it's any comfort, but I understand how much you're hurting."
 Marie burst into tears, hugging her mother.
 "I love him so much."
 "I know."
 After a few moments, Marie drew back to wipe her eyes.
 "What about Father?"
 "I met him two years after I lost Andrew.
 Your father is a good man, Marie.
 He doesn't have the passion or sweetness Andrew had, but I do love him.

At this time, remember, I was like attached to the guitar, man.
 I could make an electric guitar sing, talk, chant, name your baby.
 It was just natural.
 So, yeah, I got a reputation—they started mentioning my name alongside Beck and Page and you know the list.
 I was airborne, man.
 CM: 	Just for the record here, no pun intended, lemme run down the listings on Turntable Poison.
 Side One: “Blues for Wendy Ward,”  “Mr.
 Handy and Hakel-Bärend.”  Side Two: “In Real Time Nothing Happens,”  “A Marriage of Rue,” “Hayley Mills’ Underpants,”  “For Kim Because it Went by so Fast,”
 BG:  	Had one more song we cut—remember we did this whole thing in, what, 3 days, non-stop, popping uppers, getting patty melts at 3 a.m. from Steak and Egg, so it was kind of a blur.
 And Jim could work like that—he was amazing, a guru, a conductor, a lightning rod.

The ranks of the undead were half of what they had been, yet still he could not see the lowered black hood he so badly needed to see.
 “Come, Sonowin, we will find him, even if it means killing every last one of his puppets.”
 The horse neighed and dove, spurred on by the sight of its own kind falling in death.

 “Behind you, master,” Qurrah said.
 He hurried the words of a spell as Velixar turned.
 An incorporeal hand shot from Qurrah’s own, flying across the battlefield to where an elf dove toward them, arrows flashing two at a time in the starlight.
 The hand struck the elf in the chest, freezing flesh and eviscerating his insides with ice.
 The flying horse banked upward as its master fell limp into the fog.

It is the responsibility of the local lords to provide mounts for the Guild at the local lord’s expense.” He made sure his voice remained rough with no emotion coloring his response, just a simple squire giving a by-the-book answer.
 The Knight Captain nodded and said, “Welcome to the tournament, Squire.” He then turned to look up at the sorcerer and asked him, “Any other questions Ambassador?” The sorcerer spoke his next question directly to Rodregas, “I noticed you have a Hellborn at your side, you would insult the faith of the Knights by bringing him into the Cathedral of the Heavens?” Rodregas knew this question would come up and had the natural answer, “They are my sworn followers.
 Sworn to the All-Father.” Such an oath could not be challenged here.
 “Truly?” the sorcerer said.
 “The Great Oath of Fealty for one of Infernal birth?
 I would see that.” He turned to Doi’van who loomed over all of them.
 Doi’van had watched the show with a cold interest.
 The sorcerer spoke with a command that dripped venom, “On your knees Hellborn and swear the oath of fealty, in the name of the All-Father to this squire where we can all see.” Doi’van paused for a heartbeat and then pulled his sword out in a smooth gesture and for a moment Rodregas was thinking that a battle was to be had, but then Doi’van dropped to his knees in front of Rodregas.
 He took the sword onto his arms as if in morning sword meditation and spoke the words of the Oath.
 “By my mortal blood and sweat and tears do I swear my fealty to the Squire Rodregas in the name of the Father of Ocean, Sky and Earth.” Rodregas nodded and responded as was required, “As the All-Father protects and guards his people so do I swear to do my best to live up to your oath in the Name of the All-Father.” Rodregas reached down and picked up the sword across Doi’van’s arms and lifted it up.

Rachel flounced off, followed by a frowning Jasmin, leaving Dominic to help me out of the straitjacket I was currently using as a dress.
 Chapter 25 I slowly stretched, and then turned over and smiled when I found Alec lying on top of the covers.
 "Good morning, beautiful."
 As always, his voice sent shivers down my spine.
 By the time we'd arrived home, it was ridiculously late, and I'd barely managed to stay awake long enough to bolt down a little dinner after Donovan had helped us unload our haul.
 I'd then done the single most gutsy thing of my entire existence.
 I'd quietly followed Alec back to his room and then asked if I could sleep there again.
 He'd given me another of those long looks that seemed to say he thought it was a bad idea, but that he couldn't bring himself to deny my request.
 Not with everything else he couldn't do for me.
 "Please, I must look horrid.

There was a short hallway leading from the doors with slim white columns on each side of the hallway, in between each column hung great pieces of art; paintings, sculptures and even a small wall hanging with amazing vibrant colors with a strange abstract design were all preserved in the space.
 Van’dret was a man of some refinement and appreciation for art, and he wished he had dared to stop and inspect the pieces; they had to be some of the greatest art works in the Realm to be so on display where only those who had been invited to a private meeting with Taiga would see them.
 However Van’dret dared to do nothing more than glance at them as he hurried forward.
 It would not be smart to make the Guild Dealer wait for even a moment.
 The Guild Dealer Taiga was not such a common man that he did his work from a desk; his desires and commands came during parties and social events.
 However, if you were truly honored, though personal invitations to dine with him in his personal solar overlooking his city you would get told his wishes.
 As Van’dret stepped through the arch he was struck by the bare simplicity of the solar.
 The city known as the Menagerie of Sky, Earth and Water that Taiga ruled and had created over the centuries was a lush place, full of pleasures and growing things.
 Anything that could be found in the world was said to be found within its gleaming walls and exotic gardens.
 However, the private place where it’s Master worked, was a stark contrast.

First, if the market is so effective, why is it that every major capitalist economy utilizes such a vast array of subsidies, incentives, controls, production quotas and fixed pricing mechanisms to govern production and trade in agricultural products?
 Even after GATT, protection for this sector by industrial nations will remain high.
 Second, granted that the market works effectively for mature capitalist societies with high levels of technology, education, productivity, living standards and food surpluses, and relatively small portions of the workforce dependent on agriculture, is the same necessarily true for countries at an earlier stage of development, in which (1) a majority of the workforce is dependent on agriculture for sustenance, (2) levels of education, productivity and incomes are low, and (3) any increase in food prices can have a devastating impact on food consumption levels in the country?
 The answers to these questions are relevant both to the countries presently making the transition from centrally planned to market economies in Eastern Europe and to poorer developing countries striving to achieve food security.
 Nations accord special status to their agricultural sector for several reasons.
 Continuous supplies of food are absolutely essential to the welfare of the population.
 Food prices are extremely sensitive to changes in the supply of foodstuffs.
 Even a small increase or decrease in supply can lead to a very wide fluctuation in prices.
 A bumper harvest can depress prices to the point of bankrupting large numbers of farmers.
 A poor harvest can send food prices soaring beyond the purchasing power of large numbers of people.

Before they leave, Curly reaches down and rubs my shoulder.
 As more evidence that I’m slow to catch on, I’ll admit that not until I’m on my way, in the rain, to Seattle, do I realize Curly’s touch was the physical part of a blessing.
 She blessed me for listening to her friend’s whole story, apparently without passing judgment.

 While driving I’m inclined to find fault with others who have the gall to use the same road I do at the same time.
 Especially if they are these fellows who have surrouned me on I-5 north of Vancouver, Washington.
 In the rain, with their semis, they spray torrents at my windshield.
 But recalling that yesterday I got blessed for choosing not to judge, I begin to practice understanding these truck drivers’ concern for time and distance.
 Soon I notice that when I go into critical mode, my awareness of the proximity to God shuts down.
 Praise, love, adore, perhaps even admire or commiserate with someone, God joins in.

She cocked her head slightly to the side and looked at me with incredibly large blue eyes that seemed older than they had a few seconds before.
 "It really bothers you that everyone knows?"
 I shrugged uncomfortably.
 "I guess maybe it shouldn't, but it does.
 Nobody likes to be ridiculed, but it's even more than that.
 The attacks started up a couple of months ago.
 They...remind me of a really terrible thing that happened, so when people make a big deal out of them it's like it's all happening again."
 Rachel nodded slowly, her wonderfully expressive face full of sympathy.
 "I'm sorry to have pried like that.
 If I'd known it would make you feel bad, I wouldn't have asked."

It was too much to take in at once.
 Destroy Kojas?
 We could barely take on a mass of monsters without dying, so how were we suppose to take down an evil, powerful demon?
 As the trees parted away to show the empty ground, I spotted Emily and Jason looking like they were about to go to war with a bunch of sticks.
 When they saw us appear, both dropped their weapons and smiled at us.
 Typical cover up.
 “Hey Seth, it looks like Jazell didn’t kill you after all,” Emily said and flashed me a grin.
 “What was that all about anyway, Jazell?” I opened my mouth to spill the whole truth when Seth glanced at me.
 I sighed at his expression, knowing that I couldn’t tell anyone if Seth didn’t want me to.
 I didn’t want to make it worse by revealing what I knew.

I opened my mouth to thank him, and then felt as though my world had been pulled out from underneath me.
 The shadow went from my savior to a nightmarish being.
 It was easily eight feet tall, covered in thick fur, and had bloody claws as long as my hands tipping the ends of its fingers.
 My vision was still swimming enough that I almost couldn't believe what I was seeing.
 Even so, there was no way to ignore the bloodstained mouth as it got closer.
 I had a moment to realize I was still going to die all alone, and then the blackness came for me.
 Chapter 21 I woke up expecting to see pale blue eyes burning a hole through me.
 Haunting eyes set above terrible fangs.
 Instead I found myself lying atop a gigantic bed in a room I didn't recognize.
 The sheer shock at still being alive prevented my mind from working very well.

Alec followed me upstairs, and then slid down the wall to sit on the floor as I sat down on my bed.
 As soon as I was comfortable he reached up and flipped off the light.
 "Hey, I can't see you now."
 His laugh was like silk.
 It reached out, and smoothed away the last of the embarrassment.
 "The deal was I would come up here so you could sleep.
 You aren't going to fall asleep if the light is on and you're staring at me."
 "Fine, the light can be off, but I get to ask you questions still, and you need to start giving me real answers."
 The chuckle was a little more resigned, but he didn't argue, so I launched into my first question before I'd really thought it through.
 "What...I mean, you're all so different..." I trailed off into silence worried he was going to be mad.

In addition, elected governments find it extremely difficult to win public support for initiating and sustaining wars in which the country’s own citizenry must fight, except in order to rebuff or forestall external aggression, as illustrated by domestic opposition to America’s role in Vietnam.
 War is the engine of dictatorial power.
 Peace is the social dividend of democracy.
 Peace is not merely the absence of war.
 It is a settled, stable, secure condition which thrives on a foundation of political maturity, social freedom and economic well-being.
 A world in which all major military powers – with the present exclusion of China – have democratic governments removes the ideological basis and political pressure for confrontation between states.
 If it is maintained, the adoption of democratic forms of government by the nations of Eastern Europe and the developing world will help ensure peaceful relations between states, which is the most fundamental precondition for accelerated economic development.
 The marriage of democracy and disarmament can transform the world – abolishing wars, eliminating nuclear arsenals, liberating hundreds of billions of dollars for building a better common future.
 In economic terms, the shift to democratic government presents an opportunity for more rapid development in these countries.
 During the post-war period of technology-driven industrialization, there is a strong correlation between a representative form of government and rapid economic development.

I never believed anyone except myself.
 I was a stubborn, self-satisfied little son-of-a-bitch.
 I know that sounds egotistical, but there it is.
 I was driven, though I didn’t know it.
 I was only interested in writing songs, in playing my Gibson.
 And girls, man, lots of girls.
 I had a lot of sex in high school.
 It was everywhere, I mean, I grew up in a golden time.

Rodregas felt he owed them, and if he had been in their place he would have tried to kill Ravenhurr.
 Clearly the three human men were eager to get started back to the main road.
 He noticed that the Hellborn Doi’van and Imeralda seemed to be hanging back.
 As the three men started to head down the road Doi’van walked up to Rodregas and stated, “I would rather travel with you.” That was it; he just stood there like some huge tree after that simple statement.
 Audrian seemed as surprised as he was.
 They both spoke at the same time, their thoughts strangely in agreement.
 “Are you crazy?” asked Audrian at the same time as Rodregas said, “That is crazy.” “Look, the Guild will be after me,” Rodregas stated.
 “It will not be safe to travel in my company,” he added.
 “I know,” stated the Hellborn in a voice that was so deep it was like stones grinding.
 “But still, I would travel with you.” Again he made the statement and showed no interest in explaining his action.

 I hated this part.

 Shivers ran down my spine.

It is this experience that has convinced us of the need for wider perspectives and total solutions.
 The marvellous achievements of the past few years are neither fortuitous nor illusory.
 The Berlin Wall has been brought down and demolished.
 The Iron Curtain has been lifted and obliterated.
 But we still proceed with our heads turned back, looking for shadows behind us at a time when the future demands our full attention in order to capitalize fully on what these events have prepared and made possible.
 In this report, the Commission is calling for a comprehensive, multi-pronged approach to the problem of international security that defies and will continue to defy partial solutions.
 That approach recognizes the critical importance of the linkages between the establishment of democratic political systems at the national and the international level, the abolition of war as an instrument of policy, the elimination of highly destabilizing weapons of mass destruction, substantial additional cuts in defence spending by all parties, and the constitution of a cooperative international security system that is not state-centred and is supported by a standing international peace force.
 Taken separately, each of these elements can sub stantially contribute to improving the international political and security environment.
 Taken together as a cohesive whole, they can transform global political affairs and create a highly conducive atmosphere for the eradication of the pressing economic problems confronting us.

I already felt myself starting to drift away.
 Even the feeling of him caressing my check again wasn't enough to bring me all the way back to full alertness.
 "Somehow that all changed after you arrived.
 Little by little I started to realize just how empty my life really was.
 I wish I could come right out and say it while you're awake.
 I don't want that life anymore.
 I don't really want any life that doesn't involve you."
 Part of me wanted to scream for joy, to jump up out of my bed and wrap myself around Alec as tightly as I could, but I was just too far gone.
 I half thought I was dreaming it all.
 As I finally let sleep pull me down into darkness, I almost thought I heard Alec say one last thing.

 Well, sort of locked up.

 There were no bars or anything.
 But, I had no will, I had no good reason to do anything.
 Lorelei would just sit with me and we’d talk about small things, you know, what it was like outside, what she was reading, some painting she was doing.
 Almost anything but me getting back to the music.
 See, Lor, instinctively knew that was the sticking point, that me making music again was the key, but, also my deepest fear—that I’d lost it all.
 That I’d never write another meaningful song.

When Antonil asked that someone else deliver the proclamation, a frown had crossed the king’s smooth face and he had slammed his lotioned hand against a table.
 “It will mean more coming from you!” the king had shouted.
 “They will know the seriousness of my order.
 I will not be flooded with spies, treated like a mere peasant, and then insulted by such blatant snubbing of my humble call for aid.
 Let them know I am king, my dear Antonil.
 Make sure they know.”
 Antonil halted at the center of Veldaren where the four main roads of the city interconnected and a large marble fountain towered over all.
 Not bothering to call for silence or attention, he unrolled the scroll and shouted its edict.
 Because of his rank, the troops in attendance, and the overall respect given to the man who had engineered the city’s successful defense only days before, he was quickly given a respectful silence.
 “By order of the King, all elves are to be removed from Neldar lands.

 So I wrote.
 And, even if we never performed any of it, which we didn’t, they were my songs, and they were popping up on the radio.
 Sebastian did, “Lemmy Caution’s Incubus,” and I think that was really the start of it.
 That was big for him—he has that voice, you know, like he’s sitting next to you, and it perfectly fit the song.
 God bless him—no slouch at writing songs himself, he really took me under his wing, sort of.
 Not much has been made of that connection, but John, early on, taught me the logistics of writing for money, of getting my stuff with one of the music publishers.
 A lot of artists did this, you know, kind of like what Dylan was doing with The Basement Tapes, except that took on a whole life of its own, because it was Bob.
 So, I did some demos, at Ardent with Jim’s help, and others, I just wrote, you know, just committed them to paper and John helped me get them disseminated.
 It worked well then to do that.

She brought it on herself so there isn't any reason to cry over what might happen."
 Alec shook his head.
 "Unacceptable.
 She wasn't properly his.
 There was no bond of Ja'tell, and consequently we have no obligation to return her to him."
 Jasmin opened her mouth to say something else, but a tiny brunette, probably Jessica, interrupted her.
 "Alec, we have to do this.
 None of us are stupid; we know what's going to happen.
 You killed two members of his pack."
 There was steel in Alec's voice that I'd never heard before.

And then he realized that Teri's porch light was on and that she was probably watching to see when she could turn it off.
 Stroking Marie's hair, he pressed a final kiss to her lips.
 "I think we'd better go."
 "Hmmm?"
 She ran her hand up his neck and into his hair.
 "We need to go home.
 Teri--"  He caught himself.
 Marie would be embarrassed if she thought Teri and Jeremy had seen them kissing.
 "Mmm."
 She kissed him again.

You read books and then you write about what you’ve read?
 Naw, man.
 It all comes from the road you walk, right?
 It all comes from heartache and passion and hard-won honesty.
 At least, I hope so.
 The artists I care about, that’s what I’m talking about.
 CM: 	So, what was school like, while you were getting this reputation outside of that environment?
 Was it hard to balance both?
 BG:  	Well, hell, I was never a student, you know?
 I never believed anyone except myself.

Dealing with that will have to wait until later."
 I wanted to ask what he meant, but the halls were already full of other students, and I was pretty sure he'd tell me when he was ready and not a moment sooner anyways.
 With a sigh, I followed him into the crowd.
 A few minutes later I'd been handed off to my next babysitter, James this time, and was safely ensconced in Mr. Whethers' class.
 Mr. Whethers looked more than a little confused after reading James' note, but he simply added James' name to his roll, and then absently waved the two of us towards seats.
 I would've enjoyed English if not for the wildfire buzz created by my little scene with Alec outside of Biology.
 Mr. Whethers repeatedly asked various clumps of giggling and or staring girls to be quiet, but his efforts were largely wasted.
 As time went on the speculation grew both wilder and louder rather than petering out as any normal person would've expected.
 The former was probably due to an almost complete lack of anything resembling actual fact.
 The volume was no doubt designed to see if they could draw a reaction out of me and thereby figure out how I'd gone from dating one of the two most popular boys in school to dating the other one in the space of just one weekend.

Had I imagined it?
 Was I losing my mind?
 My head came up once more, and the woman gasped.
 It was Junnie.
 Her cloak had fallen, her golden curls a welcome sight.
 Relief flooded me.
 “Junnie!” “Freya,” she murmured, reaching out to stroke a strand of my black hair.
 The shock of seeing her disappeared at the reminder.
 “Are you here for council?
 To collect me?” My voice was colored with the shame of being a criminal.

Aurelia did not begin writing immediately, instead thinking over the pronunciation.
 “Qurrah,” she said at last.
 “It is a little tricky, but I bet it is spelled like this.”
 Letter by letter she wrote ‘Qurrah’ in the dirt.
 Harruq stared at it, whispering his brother’s name as his eyes traced the letters.
 As he did, a thought hit him.
 His eyes went back and forth from his own name and Qurrah’s.
 “You spelled my name wrong,” Harruq said.
 “What?
 How?”

You know what a squonk is, right?
 It’s like, what’s that song Cocker did so well, “I’m Gonna Drown in my Own Tears,” right?
 Squonks cry themselves to death, dissolve in their own tears.
 That’s what I mean by the ironic twists to I Was A Child.
 This charge of self-pity, yeah, man, I’m on it, I dig.
 It’s right there on the album, if you really listened to it, if you listened with more than your ears, man.
 The repetition of “I’m crying”—almost three minutes of it, I know—it goes back to “I’m Gonna Sit Right Down and Cry Over You” and Lennon’s “I Want You.”  You know, you strip it down, you get right to the core phrase, the essential thing you wanna say—that’s what I’m getting at.
 I’m crying, yeah.
 My woman done gone.
 You get it?
