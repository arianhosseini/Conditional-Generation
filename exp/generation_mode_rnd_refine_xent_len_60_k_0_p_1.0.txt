That was why he’d become my watcher.
 He gave a curt nod at my reaction, his head still dipped as he walked away.
 I wanted to speak but the words choked me.
 I wrapped myself tighter into the cloak as Chevelle constructed a hasty shelter.
 I was his responsibility, but surely he loathed me.
 How could he not?
 I thought back to the scenarios I had envisioned after the memories of my mother being killed came back to me… what I would do to those men if I were to ever find them.
 Now I remembered the truth.
 They were saving the North.
 I couldn’t say I didn’t still want revenge though.

I ask for the help of the Helper.
 I ask for the Master-yielder to show me how to yield.
 Jesus, Supreme of surrender Who obeyed unto death, You who proclaimed, "Not my will but Yours be done," Unless you say that through me, I will continue to march to the beat of my own heart.
 Think through me Speak through me Obey through me.
 Lord, Ordainer of obedience, I bow before You.
 I adore you.
 Adore through me.
 And if You must, Sweat those drops of blood through me.
 So be it.

What else did he know?
 What else could he be?
 He thought of Aurelia only once before he spoke.
 Her face was a white knife in the darkness of his mind, and he buried her deep within his heart as he yielded to the wisdom of his brother.
 “Yeah,” Harruq said.
 “I understand.”
 “Good.
 Now come.” The two resumed traveling up the small hill.
 They stopped again, however, for from their vantage point they could see the village.
 “See the torches?” Harruq asked, pointing.

"You're right, dear.
 I shouldn't have doubted you.
 I just had a few kids come hiking past this morning talking about this massive party the entire school was at last night.
 I know it's completely irrational, but I kept thinking about you there with all that alcohol."
 I was so nervous about answering her question that I didn't realize she was headed over to shut my window until she was already so close that there was no hope of intercepting her.
 Hopefully Alec had kept moving after he'd jumped.
 Otherwise Mom's questions were about to get a bit more pointed.
 "Mom, how could you think that?
 I've never even had the slightest desire to do something like that."
 The lies were starting to add up, but Alec had acted like it was important not to be grounded right now.

“And what do you do when facing a warrior in full plate armor?” asked Doi’van.
 “Even chain mail can stop an arrow or the edge of a sword.
 And while a mace is great against chain, crushing your opponent and breaking their bones, such tactics take far too long against plate armor.” Rodregas was not sure what to say to that question.
 The mace or the war hammer was, of course, the weapon of choice against all well armored opponents.
 Doi’van was right, edged weapons were not of much use against a full set of plate armor.
 That is why knights or others who could afford the cost wore all that metal.
 Rodregas had to shrug; he had no answer other than an extended fight with the mace that often did not end until one or the other was too tired and battered to defend themselves.
 Doi’van nodded at Rodregas expression of confusion, “My clan is known as the greatest warriors there are against heavily armored opponents because we are masters of the halberd.
 With a halberd we can quickly dismount an armored warrior, knock him to the ground and then, with the leverage provided by the halberd…” He swung his staff and acted like he was holding down a foe with his left foot.
 He made a savage two-handed thrust downward, “...we can pierce his armor and win the battle quickly.” Rodregas nodded.

 but she was still in 2011.
 She took a minute to get her bearings and then wandered back toward Rick’s house.
 He was perched on the edge of a chair and sprang to his feet when he saw her.
 “Are you all right, sweetheart?” he asked, taking her hand.
 “Yes.” “I’m sorry you didn’t get home.” Tears filled her eyes.
 “I tried so hard.
 I have on all my 1927 clothes, and I didn’t think about anything but what’s going on at home.” “I’m sorry, sweetheart.”  He led her into the kitchen.
 “But maybe that’s not all there is to it.

Unfortunately the effort meant I was slow responding.
 He moved on before I got anything out.
 "How's your homework coming?"
 Now I did frown at him.
 "I think my mind's going to explode if I look at my Biology book even just one more time this weekend.
 Other than that things are great."
 Alec's chuckle seemed to reach out and caress me.
 "I take it you'd be up for a brief field trip then?"
 My ears must have perked up.
 For all that we'd spent an incredible amount of time together over the last little bit, he hadn't taken me anywhere.

“You stayed home?
 Tell me you stayed home?” “Well, I stayed home all right, but that’s not the whole story.
 You see, the devil came for me.” “No.” Helga covered her face with both hands and peeked out.
 “Yes ma’am.
 He came right up and knocked on my door.” “But you didn’t let him in?” “Well, I wasn’t going to, but one look at that hunk of a man, and he got me in his spell.
 I hardly remember what happened.
 All I can tell you is, when I woke up in his arms this morning, I jumped out of his clutches and ran straight to here.
 You want to go home with me after the shift?
 If he’s still hanging around, maybe you can chase him off.” By now, Helga was wringing her hands.
 Her eyes had misted over.

Jason was leaning against a tree nearby, tossing a knife from hand to hand.
 She saw a deep, red scratch on his left cheek and the way he winced every time he moved his right arm, she could tell she must have injured it.
 “Do you know where the others are?” she asked him.
 He shook his head.
 “No, they’re just gone.” “We’re separated?” she said nervously.
 “Yes,” he replied.
 “What do we do?” “Why are you asking me?” she demanded.
 “You’re the one who comes up with plans.” Emily paced back and forth, trying to think.

The air was cold and heavy, like a mound of snow on your shoulders.
 The trees parted to show a cliff.
 We walked up to the edge and the wind whipped at my face.
 A feeling of déjà vu came upon me.
 I knew where we were because I had been here before.
 “Seth, I was here in my dream, the one with Kojas and the dwarf,” I said.
 His eyes widened and he looked down at the ground below, obviously trying to imagine what it had looked like.
 I had seen it and I was seriously scarred for my life.
 “You sure?” he asked.
 “You know that this means that Kojas was here, so he can’t be too far away.” “Don’t get your hopes up.

Ten Midgets didja say?
 I’m going with the angry gang of midgets wielding the pointed sticks they have the numbers and pointed sticks.
 Jim – There doesn’t need to be a lot of dwarves, just one of them is worth like 3 midgets, pointed sticks or no pointed sticks.
 What they lack in quantity they make up in quality.
 I mean these guys are huge and muscular, at least from a midget’s perspective, and they have those pick-axes they use around the mine.
 The seven dwarves would win hands down.
 Liz – you’re forgetting that the dwarves have just come home after a long day’s work in the mines.
 They’re exhausted, they’re not looking for a fight.
 They don’t have a prayer of taking on all 10 of the midgets.
 The dwarves might be angry about Snow White being kidnapped, but that doesn’t compare to even to the daily life of a midget.

It gives me the distinct impression that you are an obsessed fan.
 Art – I never thought of it like that.
 I don’t really feel that comfortable with the title of ‘obsessive dirty old pervert.’  It makes me feel as if I’m getting on in years.
 Karen – How about we just shorten it to pervert?
 Art – Noooo, that doesn’t feel right to me either.
 Karen – Then what would you prefer Mister?
 Art – Well, it’s a bit of a mouthful, but a bit more accurate than ‘dirty old perverted man’ or whatever.
 I mean ‘dirty old pervert man’ sounds a lot like a super villian’s name or something, and I don’t really think that I could be considered a super villain by any stretch of the concept.
 On top of that there is the ‘old’ part, I’m not really that old, I’m only forty-two years old, which may seem ancient beyond belief to a beautiful young woman such as yourself, but when you get to my level, well, it just kind of is how old you are.
 It doesn’t feel much different than when I was in my twenties or thirties, well I’m in better shape now, which isn’t saying much, I was kind of a nerd back then and didn’t do much exercising…

I've been incredibly dumb."
 She waved the explanation away.
 "Brandon's fooled people smarter than both of us put together.
 The hardest part was not being able to tell you anything."
 Alec started to open the door, but Rachel put a hand on his arm.
 "The rest of the pack is back.
 Jasmin already told them what happened.
 It doesn't look good."
 I had my mouth open and was halfway to asking what was going on when I saw Alec's expression, and swallowed my words.
 He didn't look any different than normal, in fact if I'd been standing forty or fifty feet away from him I'd probably have still thought he was just as calm and in control as always.

 "Yes.

Aurelia, however, seemed none too pleased.
 She twirled her staff again.
 “You might be surprised, orcyboy, but I could beat you in a spar.”
 Harruq scoffed.
 “You have no chance,” he said.
 “First to three hits,” the elf said, taking a few steps back.
 “Very well,” Harruq said, drawing his swords in his gigantic arms.
 “Guess you need a reminder of who you’re learning from.” He lowered his weapons and thrust out his chest.
 “Here.
 I’ll prove it.

A raucous sound traveled up to us and Chevelle waved a hand, his magic bringing the hood of my cloak up to cover my head and then his own.
 At once, my stomach was a knot again.
 We rode into town at a walk; Chevelle was sitting straight and tall in his saddle but his arm hung casually, hand resting on his leg.
 I was more comfortable watching him, looking for a reaction, than the passing elves.
 Two men walked by in the opposite direction, their dark eyes on us.
 My cape blew back, exposing the shape of my leg, and they hissed indecent comments.
 I gasped, shocked, and my horse picked up its pace to ride beside Chevelle.
 Chevelle held up two fingers slightly to silence me.
 We hadn’t ridden more than a quarter of the way into town when he turned the horses to a medium-sized structure, stopping before a water trough.
 He dismounted effortlessly and pulled me from my horse and into the building in a few quick steps, closing the door behind us.

Ruby commanded me to sit.
 Chevelle straightened, clearing his throat.
 “Frey, we need to talk with you about something.” Oh, perfect.
 I waited, and he proceeded carefully, “You know you are bound.” “Yes,” I agreed, even though I wasn’t clear how I was partially bound.
 I could use some magic, I had lost some memories.
 No, that isn’t true, is it?
 I couldn’t really remember anything from before the village.
 Anything except the dreams.
 “And I’m sure you want to be unbound?” Why is that a question?
 “Of course.” He nodded as if he were going down a checklist.

Even before I'd gotten old enough to attend Prom, I'd still invariably spent the day grouchy and depressed.
 Things only got worse as I'd aged, presumably because I wasn't really as indifferent as I liked to pretend, and I couldn't hide behind the excuse of being too young to be asked anymore.
 My pulse had already skyrocketed; I almost didn't hear what Rachel was saying over the pounding in my ears.
 "...of course it's still a little ways away, but a girl like Britney starts early so she gets as high up the social food chain as possible."
 Rachel's words calmed me a little at the same time they sparked confusion.
 I'd never heard her be quite so cynical.
 It was completely at odds with the innocent, accepting exterior she usually displayed.
 My surprise must have leaked through.
 Almost as soon the thought crossed my mind Rachel's demeanor crossed back from the older, jaded visage, to one that was more youthful, even embarrassed.
 "Sorry, I know she's your friend.

Education and training must become a life-long process for workers.
 In a number of countries, high levels of unemployment coexist with shortages of particular skills, reflecting significant mismatches between supply and demand for skills.
 The deficiencies in government-operated training programmes can be partially overcome by providing greater incentives to private firms to invest in training new and existing employees.
 Studies have found that a 10 per cent increase in expenditure on training can boost productivity by an average of 3 per cent over two years and by as much as 30 times the cost of training.
 Yet even today, only a relatively small number of companies conduct regular, ongoing training programmes.
 Launch a nationwide public educational programme on the tremendous potential gains in productivity from increased training.
 Support initiatives by providing incentives to intensify training programmes for all employees by every type of commercial and non-commercial institution in order systemati cally to upgrade the technical, vocational, organizational and managerial skills of the workforce.
 10.School-to-work apprenticeship programmes: The transition from school or college to work can be long and difficult.
 Germany's apprenticeship programme equips nearly 70 per cent of all teenagers with employable skills before they enter the workforce.
 Two-thirds of the UK workforce have no vocational or professional qualification, compared with only 25 per cent in Germany.

 I’m just here to get my head examined, and get some pills.

 Please have a seat, and make yourself at home.

“It makes me uneasy,” he said instead.
 “But do as you wish.”
 The frailer brother approached the end of the alley where the sound of combat was strongest.
 His steps faltered only once.
 When Harruq moved to catch him, Qurrah glared and leaned against the side of a house.
 When a luckless orc rushed too close to the exit, Qurrah hurled the orb.
 Its explosion conjured shadows and shifting mists of violets and purples.
 The orc collapsed, white smoke rising softly from his tongue.
 In the sudden blinding light, Qurrah laughed.
 “Never,” he said, “could I have imagined it so beautiful.”

My courage was gone again.
 He seemed to be waiting for me to speak.
 I tried, “I’m sorry I interrupted…” He nodded, but I didn’t know if he was acknowledging my interruption or pardoning it.
 He walked slowly toward the bed, glancing at Ruby’s things on the shelves and walls, and then sat on the bed beside me.
 I forced myself to continue breathing and kept my gaze down, knowing a flush was coming.
 He reached out and placed a hand under my chin, bringing my face up to meet his.
 The flush that followed was not from embarrassment.
 Heat flooded my neck, and I felt it might engulf me as he spoke my name.
 “Frey.” “Yes.” It was all I could manage.
 His eyes held mine and I could swear he was searching for something.

Not even met.
 Stared at.
 Heat crept into my cheeks for no good reason, and I picked up my pace to the old tree that housed the library.
 I knew my shoulders were drawn in and I was glancing around too often, but I couldn’t seem to help it.
 It felt illicit.
 Twice I imagined a set of dark eyes on me, a pricking sensation running over my spine.
 I was going to have to pull myself together.
 I was being ridiculous.
 At this rate, I’d be fawning and flipping my hair like Evelyn by sundown.
 When I finally walked into the library, I remembered why I didn’t go there to study lineages.

Jim, he got us a recording studio at Ardent.
 Got us some studio time.
 He’d been to numerous practices, knew our stuff.
 And he agreed to produce, under the name Euphonious Moniker.
 Of course, now, everyone knows he did it, but back then, I don’t know, there were legal complications or something.
 Anyway, with Jim there, well, he gave us the confidence to do it.
 So we started laying down tracks.
 Now, the story that’s told is that I hated recording, that I was, I don’t know, juvenile, about doing numerous takes.
 I probably did say, “That was good enough,” a couple times.
 But, man, Jim is such a gentle man, he just took it all in stride.

I ignored the thought that Mom would be mad if she knew I'd skipped breakfast and hadn't brought any lunch.
 I pulled out my old, unabridged copy of Les Misérables.
 Every so often I'd try to make it through Victor Hugo's weighty classic, but so far I'd never made it past Marius' introduction.
 Having just finished up Pride and Prejudice for the third time, I was once again due to try and make it through the written inspiration to some of my favorite music.
 I hardly noticed the slow journey into town, instead caught up in a different time and place as Valjean's story started to unfold.
 All too soon, the bus pulled up to a medium-sized, two-story brick building, and five kids my age stood up to leave.
 I followed them, my heart beating a little faster with each step.
 Other kids were trickling over to the door, either from one of the other two buses, or from the smattering of cars in the parking lot.
 Before we'd even made it inside I'd realized just how much I stuck out.
 Shorts seemed to be the order of the day, knee-length khakis for the boys, and everything from mid-thigh on up for the girls.

When he pulled it up he saw that it was a helmet, a solid Mithril skullcap with sides of chain mail designed to be connected at the bottom.
 He reached up and pulled it on his head, but even his head was too large for the AElfin style Mithril armor.
 It quickly joined the suit of armor and the candleholder on the bed.
 On the bottom shelf he found a nice pair of boots, not of AElven make.
 Attached were matching grieves, armor designed to protect the lower leg., and a pair of armored gauntlets to compete the set.
 All ended up on the bed.
 Nothing else of interest was in the wardrobe.
 Though the two fanciest robes both heavily embroidered and of Western Silk, also went to the bed.
 Next, he went to the trunk which was made of High Cedar wood and which matched the large wardrobe, but was much more portable.
 Unfortunately, the only items of use in it were several blankets of good quality wool.

“Now we’ll finally see,” Qurrah said, “what we are, what we are meant to be.”
 Thousands of orcs spilled into the west, needing no light to see in the darkness.
 They howled and cheered, drums and war chants mixing with the shrieks of the skulls.
 Harruq felt his temples throb.
 A wail rolled over him as a deathly comet swirled about, spotting the two and eying them like prey.
 Try as he might, he couldn’t stop from shaking.
 “Can you stop them?” Harruq asked, squinting at the sky.
 “Perhaps,” said Qurrah, eyes distant and unfocused.
 “But orcs don’t use necromancy, not if the stories I’ve heard are true.
 Someone else travels with them—someone who must be strong.”

I still like the lyrics: I still imagine a face white like faith’s hue and a dimple carved there and a disdain for any attention.
 How attractive these qualities are.
 How they still reverberate across the gulf of time.
 It really is a gulf, deep like an ode, and dark as if dipped in death-shadow.

What if he wasn’t going to find Junnie?
 And then I thought, What else do you have to do, sit here and blow up frogs?
 It was all the convincing I needed.
 Slinking out from the branches of the spruce, I crept low along the trees and brush as I followed my watcher north.
 Chapter Six Trails
 Chevelle kept a quick pace and I found myself struggling to keep up.
 Unlike me, he wasn’t dodging between rocks and trees, bending out of sight and watching the ground to keep from breaking twigs while he tried to keep from being spotted.
 I cursed the formal dress I’d been dragging as it snagged on a low-lying thicket, flinging another string of beads into the soft dirt.
 I considered dumping it, but didn’t think it was the best idea to be sneaking around the forest unclothed.
 After crossing a few soggy patches of moss, the hem was damp and darkened.

 Bob Williams often hung around our apartment.
 About half way through the fall semester, President Kennedy got bushwhacked.
 I was so used to good people dying, I didn’t take it as hard as some did.
 College was okay, except I came to doubt I wanted to major in Philosophy when I learned the classes were less concerned with the ideas than with arguing about them.
 And as finals approached, Laura Steinhoff's boyfriend Frank Holmes stopped by our apartment and pitched us a better idea.

I felt a surge of heat wash over my face and neck.
 Brandon for once didn't have an easy comeback to defuse the awkwardness.
 If anything he looked slightly uncomfortable himself.
 "I'm sure it's nothing important..." He trailed off as my traitorous hand found his arm of its own accord and started pulling again.
 I wasn't sure why I was so anxious; usually I avoided crowds like the plague.
 Maybe I was just trying to prolong our time together.
 I let go as soon as we reached the fringe of the crowd, and prayed it was only my imagination that made me think Brandon was just the slightest bit relieved.
 Luckily there was plenty to distract me.
 It looked like there'd been some kind of war behind the school.
 The flagpole had a massive dent in its base, and actually looked like it was leaning slightly to one side.

“We are very proud, Jazell.
 You’re supposed to leave tomorrow, so you better pack.” “I’m going to go do that.” I said quickly, while I backed up towards the stairs.
 As soon as I reached them, I shot up so fast you would think I was running for my life.
 I closed the door, locking it behind me and then dialed Emily’s cell phone as fast as I could.
 I sat on my bed as the phone rang three times before I heard it click.
 “Jazell you wouldn’t believe what my parents just told me.
 They say I signed up for some camp and-” “I know the same thing happened to me,” I interrupted her quickly.
 I hear her breathe heavily, “This is crazy, it’s just happening too fast.
 We have to go or we’ll be in big trouble with our parents.
 But the thing is we don’t know where this meeting place is and-” She was cut off by the ringing of my phone.

Whose tree do you think this is?
 You’ll lie down when I say you’ll lie down…” I bit down on a groan, eyes running over the wood grain of the table as I tuned her out.
 I knew the outcome if I didn’t, and I was already in trouble enough.
 Shortly after her tirade insisting I stay until I had earned permission to leave, the one-sided argument ran its course and Fannie tired of looking at me and sent me on my way.
 I trudged out of the kitchen, through the main sitting area, and into my room.
 It was dark except for a small beam of light from a knothole in the wall.
 Fire was the one magic I had mastered; I had been able to light lanterns and candles for as long as I could remember, but I didn’t bother.
 If I was in this room, I wanted to be alone.
 And in darkness I felt more so.

This region has emerged as an important source of trade and economic growth for the industrial nations.
 Global expenditure on education and training as a percentage of GDP has doubled during the decade.
 One remarkable result has been the complete eradication of illiteracy and universal enrolment in primary education.
 Scientists report that the ozone layer is being restored to pre-1970 levels far more rapidly than had been anticipated.
 This has been aided by a worldwide rush to renewable energy power generation led by such regions as California, which now produces 10,000 megawatts of electricity from wind power and has mandated an increase in pollution-free motor vehicles from the present level of 5 per cent to 25 per cent by 2010.
 Common sense tells us it is not possible simply to wish away the serious problems barring these achievements.
 We need the technology vastly to improve productivity in poor countries.
 We need the organizational know-how to create effective administrative and political systems in transition states and to restructure international institutions.
 We require enormous investments in constructive economic activities – as opposed to lavish arms spending – to generate jobs and higher incomes for hundreds of millions of people in the developing world, and by extension to stimulate further economic growth and job creation in the West.
 All these essential ingredients are available in abundant measure, if only we choose to employ them for our common benefit.

She had no family present.
 She told everyone how her mother told her how ugly she was her whole life and told her she was worthless, how she attempted to numb the pain with the drugs she took.
 How she became addicted to the drugs, and prostituted herself to pay for her habit.
 She said that she took all the drugs she could because she knew she would never be alive to see her twenty-first birthday.
 She smiled and announced that she was now twenty-one.
 She thanked one staff member after another and one student after another, each for something specific they had contributed to her healing.
 She said she now felt worthwhile, beautiful and confident.
 She had learned how to manage the demons in her head.
 She was beautiful and it shocked me that she had ever considered anything else and to the point that she tried to destroy herself.
 I couldn’t help but compare her in my mind to Ashley.

“I know where the meeting place is.” “Great Jason, where is it?” I asked.
 A shuffle of paper sounded as Jason moved around.
 “It’s at the art statue, the one we call the rising hill.
 It’s in the park, remember?” “Of course, when we were younger, we used to try to climb it.” I replied.
 I heard Jason chuckle.
 “Who could forget?
 So I guess I’ll see you there?” “Of course, Jason, I’ll tell Emily.” “I’ll tell Seth then.
 See ya.” Emily’s voice came back.
 “Well, who was it?” “It was Jason, he found the meeting place,” I said.
 “It’s the public art piece we use to climb.” “That makes sense.” She paused.

"They're perfect.
 Thank you."
 Rachel ducked around her brother so she could see the shoes and then smiled before leaning in to whisper.
 "Mom wore those to the Ashure Day Dance, the one where she fell in love with Dad."
 I pulled back in protest, but Alec's grasp on my hand tightened just enough to stop me.
 "She wanted you to wear them.
 They were meant to be worn again tonight."
 My head was still spinning as Alec offered me his arm and led me out of the room.
 There was a limo, easily the largest vehicle I'd ever seen, waiting for us outside.
 We piled into it with plenty of room to spare.

Steed noticed me scrutinize them, so I asked, “Are they… together?” I was confident in Grey’s affection, but they didn’t act like a traditional pair.
 Steed sighed as we watched them.
 “No.” There seemed to be more to his answer.
 “But he…” I wasn’t sure how to phrase it.
 “Yes.” Steed glanced back at me when he spoke.
 “But you can’t always have the one you want, Frey.” His voice was soft, yearning.
 I could never tell if he was teasing.
 “I heard once you could die from grief.” He smiled at my subject change.
 “It’s true.
 I’ve seen it myself.” “Tell me about it.” “No, too sad.” He was thoughtful for a moment.

“Is it true, did you take on a monster by yourself yesterday?” I sighed, shooting a look at Seth.
 “Yes it is.
 Thanks tattle-tale Seth.” “Well you did and I thought the group had a right to know that.” Seth said sharply.
 “How could you Jazell?
 You could have gotten seriously hurt.
 Plus I bet all of us want a shot at them too.” She huffed and shook her head.
 The light brown curls that framed her pretty face bounced around playfully.
 “I’m fine Emily, seriously.” Jason was silent.
 He never talked much like Emily, who was easily the most talkative, friendly person I knew.
 Jason was more of the silent, watching type, who said little but noticed much.

He didn’t care if anyone came and saw him, not even his brother.
 His tears fell onto her bloodstained dress.
 For far too long, she did not move.
 His heart cried out in agony.
 It was too late.
 He had killed her.
 “I’m so sorry,” he whispered to her.
 “Forgive me, please, if you can…”
 “What are you babbling about?” the elf asked, her eyes cracking open.
 Harruq tried to smile, but a sob came out instead.

As he reached to open a drawer he felt his leg jerk back, halting his momentum.
 He crashed to the floor, screaming in pain as one of his forearms landed hard.
 Then he felt his ankle start to burn.
 “Take him, brother,” Qurrah said, his whip wrapped around Ahrqur’s left foot.
 Harruq did not bother to cross the distance.
 He had had enough.
 Condemnation flew through the air, its aim true.
 The blade sank into the elf’s back.
 Blood and fluid covered the carpet as all life fled the body of Ahrqur Tun’del.
 Harruq strolled forward, the sound of his ragged breathing filling the sudden quiet.

There is so nothing to do here.
 You can't even go hiking anymore..." I'd already realized Britney wasn't the type to think twice before words actually left her mouth.
 Curious.
 "What do you mean we can't go hiking?"
 She was looking around at the other students.
 "Nothing, come on.
 We're going to be late for class."
 I followed without a word, even more intrigued now.
 'Cool' people don't sweat tardiness and Britney really wanted to be cool.
 A slender, frumpy-looking woman looked up from her desk as Britney and I walked in.

These subsidies cost Western consumers several hundred billion dollars annually.
 In addition, they lead to dumping of surplus sugar, cereal, milk and beef in developing countries, often pushing down the prices which farmers in these countries receive for their produce to far below their production cost.
 The benefits of eliminating these subsidies would be multiple.
 For instance, eliminating subsidies to sugar-beet growers and dairy farmers in Europe would stimulate greater demand, not only for imported sugar from developing countries, but also for cocoa, which combined with sugar and milk is the basis for the chocolate industry.
 Measures of this type will result in substantially increased demand for agricultural products from developing countries, the first step in an upward spiral of global economic growth that will stimulate industrial exports and job growth in both East and West.
 2.Global, environmentally sustainable Green Revolution.
 The term 'Green Revolution' has been praised for its positive impact on crop productivity and criticized for its likely adverse effects on the environment and social equity.
 It is often overlooked that one of the most beneficial consequences of the Green Revolution has been its 'forest-saving' nature.
 If agricultural production had not been increased through higher productivity, more forest land would have been diverted to annual cropping.
 India alone would have needed at least 50 million hectares of additional land to produce the wheat and rice it now produces, if average yields had remained at pre-Green Revolution levels.

Velixar cried out the final words of the spell, spreading the darkness for a mile in all directions, so high it covered up to their necks.
 “It is cold,” Qurrah said, his teeth chattering.
 “You will not be harmed by it,” Velixar said, watching the approaching army.
 “With so much hidden, they will be hard pressed to target us among my undead.
 Hold nothing back.
 They are here.”

 “Unleash our arrows,” Dieredon shouted back.

An institutional gap exists in agricultural training systems.
 In most developing countries, agricultural colleges, universities and polytechnics train researchers, government, bank employees and extension officers, but not farmers.
 Producing more food with less water, less chemicals and less soil erosion requires high levels of skill.
 The chain of agricultural training needs to be filled out at the lower level by establishing thousands of village-level farm schools as proposed in the chapter on food security.
 The switch from centrally planned to market-oriented economic systems in Eastern Europe cannot be successful until the population has acquired the skills needed to function effectively in the new economic environment.
 Under the communist system, emphasis was placed on education and training in technical subjects with little attention to marketing, organizational, commercial and interpersonal skills, which are essential requirements for functioning in a market economy.
 A detailed inventory should be compiled of the types and levels of skills needed for transition to the market, covering areas such as entrepreneurship, management, national and international marketing, strategic business planning, finance, quality control, product development, production technology, design, and human resource development.
 Intensive training programmes need to be introduced to impart these skills on a massive scale.
 Even in the most advanced industrial nations there is vast scope for upgrading skills to improve productivity and to keep pace with rapid technological development.
 Inadequate skills are a major impediment to the assimilation of new technologies.

The rest of the night passed quickly as Rodregas did his best to bandage his stomach wound.
 He did not think the knife had cut into anything too important; at least it was not bleeding too badly.
 He was surprised that he was not more tired; maybe his new body handled such things better and could make do with less sleep.
 He was usually a light sleeper and was very surprised that they had been able to get the drop on him.
 His guess was that the AElf maiden had cast some sort of spell on him to mask their approach, and he kept a close eye on her to make sure she did not repeat the effort.
 Of course she was also very nice to look at, so he did not need much of an excuse to enjoy the view.
 In the morning, he slowly pulled out some of the supplies and bundled them.
 He tried not to show how much he hurt.
 The wound might not kill him, but every movement hurt.
 He also handed Audrian a few of his coins.

He moved towards me with a casual grace that made little shivers run through me despite my earlier decision not to let his interest, or lack thereof, affect me.
 "I had a bet with myself that you weren't going to wait.
 Somehow the fact I just lost doesn't matter now."
 It didn't seem possible he was talking to me, that anyone so gorgeous could mean something like that about me.
 I opened my mouth, maybe to laugh the comment off, or otherwise hedge my bets against the humiliation and inevitable mocking laughter.
 Whatever it was I'd intended on saying evaporated away the instant he reached out and slowly slid his finger down the side of my face.
 The tiny part of me that was still screaming none of this could be real was pulled along by the rest of me.
 I completely abandoned myself to the sensations created by his touch.
 My nerve endings didn't know whether to classify his finger as icy cold or scorching hot, but before I could recoil in pain the sensation gave way to a tingly warmth that sank down into my center, simultaneously tightening and relaxing parts I didn't even know I had.
 My pounding heart seemed loud enough to hear from across the street.

Harruq closed his eyes, his fingers shaking.
 Deep within his chest, he felt a rage steadily growing.
 When Velixar had first given the strength to him, he’d felt an overwhelming desire to use it.
 Anger swelled inside, and when he looked to Aurelia he felt an enormous desire to attack.
 She was questioning his master, his brother, questioning what it meant to be him.
 When he opened his eyes, Aurelia stood, shocked by the red light wafting like smoke from Harruq’s eyes.
 “You could never know what I am,” he said.
 “I’ve seen what you can be,” she said.
 “Is that not enough?”
 The words stung him.

The savage clutched his stomach, his hands the only thing holding in his innards.
 Qurrah’s thin, ashen face curled into a sneer.
 Harruq turned away.
 Perhaps his brother would think him weak, but he would not watch.
 He heard a sudden shriek of pain that morphed into a long, drawn-out moan.
 As the last of the air left the orc’s lungs, Harruq turned around, startled by the sight.
 “Beauty in all things,” Qurrah said, purple light dancing across his face.
 “Especially those things that are controlled.”
 An orb floated above his open palm, seemingly made of thick, violet smoke.
 Within its center, a face shifted, its sunken eyes glaring.

“So what the priests say of how Karak is the god of death and darkness,” Qurrah asked, “is it true?”
 Velixar’s eyes narrowed, and that vicious snarl returned.
 “There were good men and evil men in his abyss after the war.
 The punishment was not to be eternal, not then, but Celestia chose Ashhur over my master.” Qurrah watched as Velixar’s hands clenched so tight his nails dug deep into his skin.
 Flesh tore, but no blood surfaced.
 “She took all who were good out of the abyss and gave their care to Ashhur.
 Left with nothing but thieves and murderers, Karak had no choice but to make it eternal.
 The abyss is dark, Qurrah, and there is fire, but there is also order.”
 “What do you wish of me?” Qurrah asked.
 Velixar’s face softened into a dark smile.

“My real duty this time, focus on the next step.
 I can do this.” As Rodregas raised the club, he kept his eyes away from the AElf maiden not wanting to give himself away to anyone watching.
 “Gods,” Rodregas quietly prayed.
 “You have never answered my prayers.
 I have never had much to give you as an offering of wealth to your temples, nor have I done great deeds in your names, but if any of you hate these life-stealing Immortalists as I do, then let me know your favor.” Rodregas could not help but add a selfish plea to his desperate prayer, “If by your grace I live, then I promise you gods that I will make it my life’s duty to fight the Life Stealers.” Rodregas doubted his prayers would do any good, but if nothing else he was a practical man and when you are pushing the odds it never hurts to call in divine favor.
 Rodregas knew things would start moving quickly now.
 Ravenhurr had been preparing the circles for months, feeding them with unearthly energies.
 Ravenhurr had not wanted the prisoners up on the tower roof until the last moment, lest their fear lead them to take desperate action.
 Ravenhurr started to speak the final words of the spell, setting off months of careful preparations.
 Rodregas knew that sorcerers use ancient languages so that others who might be watching cannot understand what they are saying and guess their intent beforehand.

It concurred that rising levels of unemployment constituted a serious problem that needed to be urgently addressed, but rejected the notion that it is an inevitable and incurable disease which the world must resign itself to passively suffer and endure.
 The Commission, therefore, developed and presented a comprehensive strategy for job-led economic growth.
 Over the past decade, changes in the employment picture lend credence to ICPF’s perspective.
 The American economy experienced a decade-long expansion, fuelling high levels of employment at home, while stimulating job growth throughout East Asia, attracting a massive influx of foreign technical workers and setting the stage for a global outsourcing boom which is still in its infancy.
 Among the advanced economies, unemployment declined from an average of 6.9 per cent in the period 1985-94 to 6.5 per cent during the last 10 years.
 It fell by 10 per cent in France, 25 per cent in Italy, a third in Netherlands, 50 per cent in Spain and 70 per cent in Ireland.
 It is declining but remains 10 per cent higher than the average for 1985-94 in Germany, which is still recovering from the economic impact of reunification.
 The new market economies of Eastern Europe are growing rapidly.
 But these positive trends are no grounds for complacency.
 While they may dispel fears of an irreversible shrinkage of the job market in OECD countries, the proportion of long term unemployed remains at an unacceptably high 29 per cent of the total, indicating that these countries have not yet evolved successful strategies to address the issue.

A few seconds later I heard the howl of an after-market exhaust fed by a turbo-charged engine.
 The green Honda that came screaming through the parking lot was hardly recognizable as an Accord.
 It was approaching too quickly, but I couldn't bring myself to care.
 Besides, Rachel seemed unconcerned.
 Rachel helped me up as the car came to a screeching halt, all four tires locking up to slide it around so that the passenger side was facing us.
 The over-tinted windows smoothly slid down to reveal that James was indeed the driver, and he wasn't any happier than he'd been a few seconds earlier.
 I started towards the back seat, only to feel Rachel's surprisingly-firm grasp guide me towards the front seat.
 She got me settled and then slipped in behind me.
 James pulled out of the parking lot with a rush of acceleration that pinned me to my seat.
 Normally I'd have gripped the door hard enough to make my fingers creak, but I was still strangely unconcerned with the possibility of dying.

My pulse quickened and I had to remind myself he hated me.
 He was my watcher.
 He was fulfilling a duty.
 Then I realized what Ruby had said and I wondered if my brain would ever be quick enough to keep up.
 “Guests?” He hesitated before answering.
 “We will be traveling with some friends.” He was so vague.
 A formless irritation started to crawl its way to the surface, but I had to remember I had no right to ask.
 These were my captors.
 My fingernails cut into the palm of my hand where the map had been.
 We’d be traveling to the peak, they’d said.

He led the elves that aided Karak in the great war against Ashhur.
 When Celestia cursed his kind, they shared his curse.” Velixar smiled at Harruq, his eyes gleaming.
 “Long have I waited for someone to wield these blades.
 An elf crafted and used them in battle, an elf cursed into an orc.
 These swords can only be held by one who has the blood of both inside him.” Velixar held the hilts out to Harruq, who drew one from its sheath.
 The sword’s blade was deep black and wreathed in a soft red glow.
 He weaved it through the air, his mouth agape at the ease in which it glided.
 “They are not as long as your previous weapons,” Velixar said, “but you will adjust.
 These blades will make you faster and more skillful than ever before.
 Forget everything you know about yourself, and know only that you are unstoppable.”

And it’s a nausea that is in your blood—your whole body is sick.
 And, you know, looking at it now, I think I was sick like the country was sick.
 I was nauseated for the USA, you dig?
 I took those deaths, that ignominious war, the whole queasy zeitgeist of the times and internalized them.
 And I couldn’t get away, not in a cabin, not in my music, not anywhere, man, because the enemy was me.
 And, dad, anyone who’s ever had that kind of stomach failure, where you feel like your whole system is shutting down on you, knows how bone-deep that kind of pain and fear is.
 This is when I started shooting horse.
 I’m not proud of it.
 You know, I’d always used drugs, to perform, to get up for a performance, to come down afterwards—there were always pills around.
 But I had stayed away from the hard stuff until my GI went bad.

"Yeah."
 She leaned close, inhaling.
 Then she raised her face to nuzzle his neck.
 "You put on fresh cologne."
 "I wanted to be sure I had on enough for the t-shirt to absorb it."
 She kissed his neck.
 "Do you want me to heat up the food?"
 "I'm not hungry."
 She took a wonton and held it to his lips.
 "Sure?"

“Guests?” He hesitated before answering.
 “We will be traveling with some friends.” He was so vague.
 A formless irritation started to crawl its way to the surface, but I had to remember I had no right to ask.
 These were my captors.
 My fingernails cut into the palm of my hand where the map had been.
 We’d be traveling to the peak, they’d said.
 I couldn’t guess what waited there, but that didn’t stop the hope that it was something of my mother, my family.
 But even if it wasn’t, I’d be that much farther away from the village and council.
 The second bit of Ruby’s parting comment registered, so I excused myself to her room with a yawn and a short good night.
 I closed the door behind me, and though tired, knew I wouldn’t sleep with him in the next room.

They were no soldiers.
 Only a scattered few wore armor.
 Still, they stood in the straight lines of a disciplined army.
 A roar from Harruq at their heels spurred them on.
 They charged the line, crying out for aid.
 “A creature attacked our town,” shouted the mother.
 “Please, my daughter is still there.
 They might hurt her.
 Please, help us!”
 “There’s two,” shouted one of the farmers.

Then he was up, his bow in hand.
 The string vanished from the bow, spikes pierced the front, and out came the long blades at each side.
 “You foolish mortal,” Velixar said.
 His voice was far deeper than before, less like a man and more like a demon.
 “I do not fear your steel.”
 Pale hands shot upward, hooked in strange formations.
 Dieredon stabbed a long blade straight at the man’s throat.
 The blade halted halfway there, crashing against an invisible barrier.
 The elf struck again, this time lower.
 Velixar’s image rippled as if beneath water, his body protected by some unseen wall.

I found nothing but the horses, but I would take it.
 I left my body completely.
 My entry was so furious it startled the horse.
 I held him there, but when he raised his head from grazing, he was facing them.
 They were standing, kneeling, surrounding my limp body.
 I watched them, the horror on their faces, for an immeasurable moment.
 It was too much.
 It was all too much.
 A raw, unbearable ache crushed my chest and I gave in to it, accepted it.
 There was nothing else I could do.

Her throat tightened, and she pulled her chin free, shaking her head.
 "I can't."
 She gripped his hands.
 "It's like a lifeline.
 I love you, and I love 2011, but if I let go of my home, I'd be lost."
 Rick reached into his pocket, taking out his handkerchief and handing it to her.
 She started to wipe her face with it but then stopped.
 Rick frowned as she stared at it.
 "What's wrong?"
 She went to the bathroom for some tissue.

He came over and bent down, tracing the sign with his finger.
 I waited and finally said, “Well, do you know what it is?” Seth dropped his finger.
 “It means, 'slayer of worlds'.
 Does that ring a bell?” “How do you know that?” I asked.
 He shrugged.
 “I don't know how, I just do.
 Maybe that's my power.” “Well, I want to go this way,” I said and pointed to the entrance.
 “If something like that is on the entrance, I want to know where this goes.” “I agree but aren't we supposed to be trying to find Emily and Jason?” “I have an idea,” I said and pulled my bow off my back.
 I removed one of my arrows and put my bow on the ground.
 I walked over to Seth and pulled his sword out of its sheath.

Not sure if that is true though.” His voice, in contrast to Imeralda’s, sounded completely normal.
 “Don’t you care that he did something so stupid?” asked Imeralda.
 “Well,” Doi’van replied slowly, “the cats are obviously connected to him due to his Celestial lion essence.
 He freed them and now he has found a rich place for them to rear their young if they are pregnant from the mating.
 But with beasts like that, you are either in charge or you are game.
 I think that he probably did the right thing.
 No way to know for sure, but they did not rip him apart, so we will say he was very brave and not very stupid.” Then he added, “Of course, if you had asked me before hand, I would have said that taking food from a Dire Cat was a very stupid idea.” He finished with a smile full of sharp teeth almost a match for the lions and in a casual movement lowered his horned head in what Rodregas thought might be his equivalent of a shrug.
 The next morning they repeated the Morning Prayer and meditation ritual.
 This time while Doi’van joined in, Imeralda mostly watched.
 Afterwards Rodregas said to both, “I have been thinking that we are probably going to be here a few weeks while I finish healing up from the knife wound.

The biggest surprise was probably Geriodon, who had beaten Rodregas earlier that day.
 Rodregas could not argue against sharing the minor sigil as he clearly fit the description of a worthy candidate.
 Geriodon was more than happy to swear that he had no love for the Guild and that Justice should be dealt to all equally.
 But before accepting the sigil he wanted to be sure that any Shadow Order he joined was mostly about secrecy to protect themselves, and that he would still be able to compete for true knighthood in the Order of the Soaring Heavens.
 Rodregas dropped into his cot tired and exhausted.
 Even with his healing sigil he had needed a full night’s rest, but duty did not wait for what a man needed.
 Imeralda woke him slightly after dawn, and Rodregas could tell that both she and Doi’van had spent the few hours left of the night working on what was left of their equipment.
 The tear in both his leather shirt and chain were sewn up, the first with thread the second with steel wire.
 For a mace, Doi’van had bought a piece of round solid steel from the smithy.
 It was a crude thing but of the proper size to qualify for the tournament.

The map on my palms was gone.
 My skin was unmarked, no indication whatsoever it had even been burned.
 Is this our destination?
 My gaze shot up to find the village, and then I hastily clicked my heels when I realized I was being left behind.
 As we advanced, I could see movement amongst the elves.
 There was much activity, but it was nothing like home.
 No flags of quilts and rugs blowing in the breeze, no bright sunlight on a rainbow of colors, no dancing in the village center.
 A raucous sound traveled up to us and Chevelle waved a hand, his magic bringing the hood of my cloak up to cover my head and then his own.
 At once, my stomach was a knot again.
 We rode into town at a walk; Chevelle was sitting straight and tall in his saddle but his arm hung casually, hand resting on his leg.

Ravenhurr was a powerful sorcerer who used magic quite casually; it would become quite obvious that Rodregas did not know how to use magic anywhere near Ravenhurr’s level.
 As soon as the keep emptied out for the birthday celebration he would make his escape.
 If he missed this opportunity he was not sure when he could try again.
 It was very rare for an Immortalist to leave his tower, and if he were behaving oddly, the guild would send someone to check on him soon.
 They were careful in their control of the kingdom.
 For a while Rodregas just leaned against the cold stone wall.
 Not thinking of anything, there was too much to think about to even start.
 So instead of thinking he simply felt the cool stone wall and it slowly, truly, hit him.
 He was alive.
 For some time that simple awareness was enough.

 I enjoy most of her work when I see it, but I’m not really interested in art or artists.
 I guess I’m one of her fans though.
 Karen – Are you some sort of dirty old man?
 Art – Well you know I usually don’t try to be.

Between 1990 and 2000, malnutrition declined from 21 per cent to 18 per cent of the population of developing countries, but it actually increased marginally among the least developed nations, particularly in Africa.
 Incidence of malnutrition among children under five years of age remains severe in both Africa and South Asia.
 But the problem is more complex than these numbers suggest.
 Although India is considered a food surplus state, it is home to the largest number of undernourished people in the world and access to a balanced diet and clean drinking water is far below the basic requirements for sound health.
 Projections indicate that over the next decade growth of the world’s food supply will be adequate to meet the needs of all human beings.
 The UN Millennium Development Goal of halving the number of human beings suffering from hunger and malnutrition between 1990 and 2015 is highly commendable, yet achieving it would still leave an unconscionably large number of people without adequate food.
 More can and must be done in the next decade to eradicate the scourge of hunger.
 The problem of water scarcity is even more pervasive and challenging.
 Studies indicate that by 2015 more than half the world’s population – mostly in Africa, the Middle East, South Asia and Northern China – will be living in countries that are ‘water-stressed’.
 In the developing world, more than 80 per cent of the water is utilized for agriculture, an unsustainable level that is depleting water tables, increasing soil salinity and accelerating erosion.

And I had no magic to lead me in the right direction.
 I went to the section which would most likely house the desired information, and then closed my eyes and concentrated.
 Maybe it wouldn’t work, but I could try.
 I wasn’t sure I felt anything, but after a few minutes I imagined my right hand might have tingled a little.
 I grabbed a close volume and leafed through it.
 It was a legacy of the Viridian Forest clan.
 I pulled another volume down.
 A diary of Momar the Ancient.
 I sighed.
 This was going to be like trapping a greased pixie.

“Such blasphemy against the elven goddess,” he said.
 “Appropriate, so appropriate.
 You have sworn your life to me, half-orc.
 You should learn what you stand to gain.”
 The cloaked man reached across the fire.
 His fingers brushed Qurrah’s pale face.
 Sudden, awful pain pierced his skull.
 Visions flowed through those fingers, dominant and brutal.
 _Qurrah marched through a burning city commanding a legion of walking dead.
 Screams of men and women sang a constant chorus, and in the distance, a castle crumbled to stone and dust.

"Do you know why those guys kept throwing the frisbee to you?"
 "To watch me jump and bend."
 When his eyes showed surprise, she told him, "I know I'm naive, Rick, but I'm not totally stupid.
 After all, you stared at me all morning."
 "That's different," he muttered, glancing away.
 "Why?"
 When he didn't answer, she took his hand, lacing her fingers with his.
 "They tried to make a game of picking me up and throwing me into the waves, but I wouldn't let them.
 I didn't let them touch me.
 Not even to help me up."

“Minor?” I squeaked.
 “Seriously, did you not hear a word I just said?” He placed his pudgy hands on his small hips.
 “Miss don’t you think that Her Majesty would have this all planned out?
 You don’t have to worry.” Seth twirled his sword.
 “Why not, we have to tell our parents something.” “Sir, don’t worry about a thing.
 All you need to do is go home.
 Everything has been arranged.” “What do you mean, arranged?” Seth asked sharply.
 The dwarf seemed to bounce up and down.
 “It has sir, but I don’t know what her majesty did.
 All I know is that all of you have to go home to get ready.” My mind whirled with all this new information.

The people running and screaming and dying were his clan.
 I knew the cloaks in that vision now, too.
 They were Grand Council.
 The council was circling my mother to stop her.
 She was killing the northern clans.
 I didn’t know why.
 And I didn’t know how I knew, but I was certain I didn’t want my memories back.
 What I had was already too much.
 I couldn’t fathom the pain Chevelle had suffered, surely a hundred times mine at the loss of my mother.
 His mother… his father… each member of his family?

bla, my crack-berry rang.
 I looked at the caller ID and it was Steve’s number, not Ashley’s.
 This was even better since the goal was to get him and she was ancillary.
 I picked up the phone, which was still connected to the recording device, and she introduced herself and said she was calling from her boyfriend’s phone because hers was broken.
 The call went better than expected as you could hear Steve coaching her in the background.
 Ashley fell nicely into all of the comments the police wanted to record.
 I was told by Officer White to tell her I could meet her in a couple of days as I was out of town.
 I told her I would call her when I returned and after work hours.
 She agreed and the call ended.
 At the time, I didn’t understand why we didn’t just go do the deal right away, but the cops needed to get a crew together and do all this planning for the bust.

 Jim – You knew that Elizabeth felt something for me, and you didn’t say anything, what kind of friend are you?
 Johnny – Maybe he’s Elizabeth’s friend more than he’s your friend.
 If that’s the case he might have wanted to spare her from a lifetime of living with you.
 Jim – What do you know about it?
 Johnny – I’ve lived with you for a lifetime.
 Nobody should have to go through that.
 Eugene – And Elizabeth seems to want that kind of fate.
 Johnny – I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again, Elizabeth is a strange person.
 Jim – You’ve never said that.

Dancing happens to be one of them.
 In fact, I don't think I'll ever forget the expression on Jasmin's face when he told her she could go clubbing all she wanted after he judged her suitably proficient in real dancing.
 He said he wouldn't have her 'seduced by throbbing beats and soulless contact' before he'd at least exposed her to proper dance steps."
 I felt a giggle surge past my lips, and pressed them tight before I could completely embarrass myself.
 "That's amazing.
 My dad thought knowing how to dance would make my first dance easier.
 It turned out to be a complete waste of time.
 Nobody asked me to dance and his lessons wouldn't have helped even if they had.
 Still, now I wish I'd done a better job of learning."
 Alec nodded, but there was a distracted air to the gesture.

 The thought of being courted was revolting.
 Rick had said that they'd both eventually settle for someone else and get married, but she had no intention of marrying anyone else.

 Ten Midgets didja say?
 I’m going with the angry gang of midgets wielding the pointed sticks they have the numbers and pointed sticks.
 Jim – There doesn’t need to be a lot of dwarves, just one of them is worth like 3 midgets, pointed sticks or no pointed sticks.
 What they lack in quantity they make up in quality.
 I mean these guys are huge and muscular, at least from a midget’s perspective, and they have those pick-axes they use around the mine.
 The seven dwarves would win hands down.

Anyone else waking up in a strange place would've run away as soon as they regained consciousness.
 At the very least, you should have started screaming.
 Instead you wander around, take in some rather feeble attempts at art, and then sneak out without saying a word."
 Secure in the knowledge he could see me, I stuck my tongue out at him.
 "Hey, my survival instincts, or lack thereof aren't the point.
 Stop trying to distract me."
 "I suppose I deserved that.
 It's just more than a little unsettling how quickly you're putting pieces together.
 There really are things that aren't safe for you to know.
 Among them, the reason why it isn't safe for you to know them."

I silently told myself things were as bad as they were going to get.
 I was wrong.
 The boy wasn't as cute as Alec, but he was so close I could hear those cosmic scales being melted down into something useless again.
 Paperweights maybe.
 I didn't want to see the mess my water had made of his shirt, so I started at the top and worked my way down.
 I'd seen better hair in a couple of fashion magazines, but not very many.
 Casually windswept, straight blond hair had become iconic sometime in the last few years, and this boy either spent an hour on his hair each morning, or the wind in Utah was kinder and gentler than the wind in Minnesota.
 Kinder, and currently working on its cosmetology license.
 His skin was exquisitely tanned, lighter than Jasmin or Alec's, but exactly suited to his lighter hair tone.
 Friendly gray eyes perfectly spaced above some of the most natural looking white teeth I'd ever seen.

“Hey, don’t take this personally, but we want to hang out alone.
 So…bye!” Jason said and jumped on his bike.
 Seth unchained his bike and rode off with him.
 I realized then that Seth had barely said anything the whole time, but he was already out of sight.
 I’d have to question him later.
 I sighed, “Well, at least we can hang out early.” “Well, while you were arguing with the boys I called home and they said you could come over now.” Emily flashed me one of her million-watt smiles.
 “Great!” I piped.
 “I’ll call home quickly to check with my parents.” I called home and my parents said I could go, which wasn’t much of a surprise.
 I’ve been to plenty of sleepovers at Emily’s, so my parents didn’t mind.
 Plus, our parents were close and Emily’s family was practically an extension of our own.

Information superhighways: Information is a catalyst and stimulant to social development.
 The speed of information, like the speed of transportation, is a critical determinant of economic activity.
 Innovations brought about by the marriage of computers and telecommunications will make possible more, faster and better communication in developing countries at substantially lower cost through global computer networks and satellite-linked telephone systems.
 In some areas, such as finance, news and sports, the barriers to the flow of information are already crumbling.
 The increasing quality, quantity and speed of information flows about markets, technologies and significant events are quickening growth of the global economy.
 One consequence has been the globalization of financial markets, resulting in increased financial transfers to developing countries.
 The technology exists for similar achieve ments in many other fields related to development.
 Global consciousness: The impact of the 1992 Earth Summit goes far beyond the decisions taken to protect the global environment.
 By focusing on critical threats that can only be met through common action, it has changed the way people and nations think about the world and each other.
 A consciousness of One World is emerging above the din of individualistic and nationalistic self-interest.

The fruits looked like giant acorns, but rounder and softer.
 She handed Rodregas one and then waited for Doi’van to follow her instructions.
 Then, warning him to be ready, she dropped down one of the fruits which he caught with his normal grace.
 “Stay on the root,” she warned him.
 “You cannot take one of the blessings off the tree; it will wither and die if you try.” She winked at Rodregas as she said this.
 Imeralda then proceeded to eat the acorn shaped fruit; it took some work.
 It seemed to be a bit harder than any ripe fruit Rodregas knew of, but he followed her example and found that while it was tart it was amazing.
 It tasted of... Rodregas did not know what to call the flavor; the words that came to mind were sunlight and rain and the smell of a forest at night.
 When Rodregas finished the fruit completely he felt more whole but was also sad that it was gone.
 Imeralda seemed in great humor.

Dark hair, blowing in the wind, arms outstretched, the pendant hanging at her neck glowing fiercely.
 Fire, flames, burning.
 And then water.
 Drowning.
 Over and over and over.
 It almost made the cliff dreams more bearable, to be away from the repetitive drowning.
 I swam around in these impressions for what seemed like an eternity.
 Eventually, they became so familiar they all started to seem like my dreams, not someone else’s.
 Then the dreams stopped.
 No images flickered behind my lids, yet my eyes did not open.

 I mean, I'll do his shirt with my laundry.
 In-in case he doesn't get around to doing it himself right away."
 "She does her laundry here sometimes," Rick said.
 "There's not a hook-up in her apartment."
 "Oh.
 I know a lot of grad students, so I know what that's like."
 They'd told Teri and Jeremy that Marie was working on a master's degree in history at Boston College.
 As they headed for the living room, Rick slid his arm around Marie's waist, leaning close to whisper, "You're doing fine, sweetheart."
 She glanced up at him.

Why had I expected more from him?
 He was my watcher.
 He’d volunteered to help council bind me.
 But it didn’t stop the hostile stare I was sending his way.
 Ruby stepped in front of him.
 “I’ll stay with her.” He didn’t reply; he merely turned from her to walk into the haze.
 I was still fuming when she faced me, wearing a self-satisfied smile.
 She practically danced forward to plop down in front of me.
 “I have something for you, Frey.” I simply stared at her.
 She was harder to stay mad at.

Eugene – Jim, is Art back yet?
 Jim – Not yet, why do ya ask?
 Eugene – I need to talk to him about something.
 Jim – Well he should be back later today, he was planning on making the opening of Liz’s show.
 Eugene (sits down on the other couch and sighs) Thanks, I’ll catch him then.
 (Pause) Are you still reading that stupid comic book?
 Jim- Damn strait!
 Sumo Assassin kicks ass!
 And I’ll thank you not to call it stupid.
 Eugene – It’s the dumbest concept for a comic book ever.

I have an eye on the copter and a hand on Grandpa’s leg as I attempt to pull him to the ground with the rest of us.
 People are barely audible but they are screaming and crying and in total panic.
 The men reach inside the helicopter and they hold what appear to be large boxes.
 They turn the boxes over in all this mayhem; something dumps out in large clumps banging down on the top of the cars and limos they hover over.
 The loud bangs cause those who aren’t looking to think they are explosions or gunfire.
 A closer look at these clumps reveals that they are flowers!
 In a misguided effort to sprinkle flowers over the gravesite ceremony, they have terrified everyone (except Grandpa).
 Most of the crowd starts to realize what is actually happening.
 The door of the helicopter slides shut and it rises into the air above crowds who lie on their bellies or who have taken off running through the cemetery but one old man, who remains standing with his arms still raised.
 The crowd begins to rise and a collective chuckle begins to infect the crowd as we all realize what we have just experienced.

The reform programme was based on the implicit assumption that the market is a self-regulating mechanism which can substitute for regulation by government.
 This notion is contradicted by the experience and practice of every major market economy in the world.
 Government plays a critically important role in defining and protecting property rights, ensuring competitive conditions, controlling monopolies, regulating foreign trade, establishing and enforcing quality standards, safeguarding the rights of investors and consumers, preserving the environment from over-exploitation and pollution, encouraging investment, and upholding the rights of employees to minimum wages, safe working conditions and social security in the case of lay-offs.
 The policies that have made possible the most successful recent development initiatives of nations around the world, especially in Japan and the newly industrialized nations of the Pacific Rim, do not support the argument for unregulated free market forces.
 These countries combined freedom for entrepreneurial initiative, private property and market prices with care fully crafted industrial policies and tightly controlled foreign trade and investment practices to nurture and protect nascent industries and restrict foreign investment.
 At the same time, they organized the importation of foreign technology on a massive scale.
 They utilized import tariffs, export incentives, tax relief and other mechanisms to guide development of their domestic economies.
 The reform programme involved the dismantling of most of the administrative mechanisms by which an economy can be monitored and controlled by government.
 In place of free market conditions, organized crime and corruption became rampant.
 In seeking to reject thoroughly the authoritarian form of government that suppressed the rights of the people, many of these countries allowed the power and authority of their central governments to de cline to the point where they could no longer enforce conditions needed for operation of either a command economy or a free market system.

The three of them froze while the two cats just sprawled out in casual comfort close to the fire.
 One of the cats (Rodregas had not been able to tell the two apart yet) stretched over and started to rub her chin against Rodregas’ leg.
 The power behind its head was such that it almost knocked him over.
 He had seen small house cats make similar gestures, but it was disconcerting to have two powerful predators such as the Dire Cats being so friendly.
 “I guess this means we are part of the pride,” said Imeralda, slowly reaching over and giving the other cat a tummy rub.
 Rodregas held his breath, as the cat responded with its paws by stretching out, its claws popping free with the stretch.
 They showed no signs of aggression, but just looking at the size of their claws, and then at Imeralda, made Rodregas want to jump over the Dire Cat and put his body in front of her.
 Rodregas was fully aware of how one swipe of those claws would likely kill her.
 Unlike the house cats that he was familiar with, Rodregas could see a kind of intelligence in their eyes.
 He had the feeling they both knew to be careful with a fragile mortal, and they thought it was funny that he was so worried.

I took one deep breath before we kicked the horses into a gallop and ran from the fort in a pack.
 Our pace finally slowed as the way became too treacherous.
 Massive rock formations loomed over us, loose stones underfoot causing the horses to stumble.
 The haze was so thick I couldn’t see anything but the riders in front of me.
 I only knew from the strain on my legs we were heading up, climbing higher into the gray sky and biting wind.
 Chevelle rode beside me through the day.
 When we stopped for the evening, he pulled me down from my horse and stayed near as we sat on large stones around a fire.
 Ruby was telling stories again and everyone gave her their full attention… everyone but us.
 “How do you feel?” he asked.
 I shrugged.

She looked up at him in surprise, and with a hint of fear.
 Rodregas raised his hand up in a peaceful motion.
 She probably had nowhere else to go.
 He ignored her and went to the cabinets and the cold box.
 He got out cheese and bread, found some fruit and had a good simple meal.
 He would need to pack as much food as possible for his journey.
 The old kitchen drudge was still peeling the same potato when he left the kitchen.
 Freshly fed and feeling better for it, Rodregas went across the main hall and entered the door opposite the kitchen into the barracks section of the keep.
 The place was about as messy as he had ever seen it; the normal tidiness demanded by Captain Poir had apparently been put aside in excitement over the chance to take some time off for the celebration.
 His personal bunk and trunk were a mess.

There is a strong positive correlation between higher education and higher incomes.
 The employment rate for college graduates in the United States is 75 per cent versus 48 per cent for high school drop- outs; at the height of the recent recession, 3.2 per cent of college graduates were unemployed compared with 11.4 per cent of high school drop-outs.
 Only 57 per cent of 18-year-olds in the OECD countries are pursuing formal education.
 The Japanese built their highly competitive workforce by raising the educational attainments of the bottom half of their primary and secondary school population.
 Raising the minimum compulsory level of education, as Belgium did in the mid-1980s from 16 years to 18, slows the entrance of young people into the labour market, better equips them for employment and in creases the demand for teachers.
 Extending compulsory education by two years or doubling the teacher– student ratio in the United States could generate several million additional jobs in teaching.
 A national commitment to raise the minimum standard, the average level and the quality of education can act as a great medium-term stimulus to job creation.
 9.Continuous training: Technological development is dramatically speeding up the rate at which old skills become obsolete and new ones are needed.
 Education and training must become a life-long process for workers.
 In a number of countries, high levels of unemployment coexist with shortages of particular skills, reflecting significant mismatches between supply and demand for skills.

It was a song I’d written right before we went into the studio, so we’d never done it live—maybe that was the reason we struggled with it.
 But, the lyrics, you know, they’re a little complex: “I took my Melville out into the sun, what else could I do, I was in my twenties” it begins.
 Not exactly pop schmaltz,  you know, ABAB.
 It was a more complex rhythm to the whole speaking—and I did just sort of speak the lyrics—that was Jim.
 At first I wanted to sing it—you know, I’d worked out a melody, a weird melody.
 And he said, on, I don’t know, the like 16th try, Jim said, shit, let’s not sing this one.
 Gimme a Lou Reed kind of thing.
 Half talk the damn story.
 I’m gonna use that melody behind you.
 And he did, man, he played what I was singing on a plastic tonette—no shit, that’s that weird, unearthly descant in the background, Jim on this little toy.

three months away.
 He had to have at least a small sample now.
 Tilting her chin up, he smiled at her.
 "You're beautiful, Marie."
 She caught her breath, unable to respond.
 To her delight, she saw that he was going to kiss her.
 She closed her eyes, savoring the anticipation and then the sweetness of his lips on hers.
 When, after a few seconds, he didn't end the kiss, her heartbeat sped up.
 He'd never kissed her this long before.
 But her eyes flew open when she felt his hand slide under her skirt to squeeze her thigh.

“So we go back to the village and…” They shared an uncomfortable glance, and then, “Not High Council, Freya.
 Grand Council.” Oh, right.
 The ones who were trying to capture me.
 The ones who want to burn me.
 Their cautious demeanor made more sense now.
 The council had sent trackers—the pair Chevelle had choked and released, and the other, the broken, limp corpse in the clearing by the ridge.
 We had killed him.
 And they were worried about my stupid binding?
 The circling cloaks from my dreams were back, filling my head.
 My thoughts were twisting, getting out of control.

Members would be banned from possession of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
 Existing weapons would be destroyed or turned over to the peace force.
 As in NATO, members would agree by treaty to consider an attack on one member as an attack on all.
 The peace force would intervene automatically and unconditionally – defensively and, if necessary, offensively – to protect the sovereignty and international borders of any member country, provided that it conformed to the rules under the charter.
 The organization could also assist members in fighting drug trafficking and terrorist activities.
 The benefits of this cooperative peace-keeping mechanism would be manifold:
 Since the charter would bind members and the alliance to eschew the use of force and aggression for any reason, it would represent a stabilizing, non-provocative, non-offensive defence.
 Its charter could also include specific provisions for close association with other international forces.
 Its combined strength and technological capabilities would exceed those of any of its members and constitute a substantial deterrent to aggression against any member country.
 It would significantly reduce the costs of security for members, possibly by up to 50 or 75 per cent, without compromising their legitimate security needs.

He reached out and wove his fingers together; he pulled his thumbs down and opened his woven hands in the ancient symbol of opening oneself to the gods.
 “Dear Celestials in the heavens, we open our hearts to you and we accept our duties as your warriors here in the world.
 Let your courage fill our hearts and your strength fill our arms.
 May we know the guidance of your twin children, Honor and Justice.” He then knelt down and pulled one of the two short swords from his weapon harness; he crossed his arms and laid the blade across his own upper arms.
 It was possible, only with great concentration to do this without dropping the sword or cutting himself.
 His instructor had taught the squires this simple prayer.
 It guaranteed that the squires stayed focused during meditation.
 Doi’van and Imeralda looked at him as he knelt in the grass with the sword naked on his bare arms.
 Rodregas spoke carefully so as not to tip the sword and said, “It is called sword meditation.
 My instructor would start us out with the prayer and then we would meditative on our duty.” “For how long?” asked Imeralda.

 "Soon it'll be the six of us."
 She frowned up at her brother.

 "We might just have to make it a double wedding."
 Her mouth fell open.
 "You're betrothed?"
 "No, not yet.

 She grinned.
 "But I didn't get as many opportunities as I would have liked.

 Rick leaned forward to take her hands.

 "You can wear this over it until you get in bed and when you get up.

 "Do you need anything else?"
 "No, thank you."
 "If you need anything, just yell."

Jasmin and Dominic crowded up against me, one on either side, and I let my hands brush against their heads.
 The feel of their fur, one short and soft, the other long and coarse, anchored me before the surreal strangeness of the scene could carry me away.
 The tingle of shape shifter power was as strong as I'd ever felt it, jumping from multiple sources, arcing around me as it unsuccessfully looked for a place to ground out.
 For the first time, I was able to accurately pick out the individual signatures that made it up.
 Jess was off to the left, white hot with mixed anger and fear, stabilized only by the cool, controlled pillar of power that was Isaac.
 Jasmin almost hummed under my fingertips like barely-leashed violence, while my other hand drank from the still pond that was Dominic, her mere presence feeding me comfort.
 I'd just finished identifying the raging beast to the right as James, when Brandon stepped into the light.
 He looked like some kind of pagan god, smeared all over with blood, an uneven circle drawn on his chest, filled with sharp, angry lines that didn't mean anything to me, but which made the wolves around me tense and growl.
 "While I appreciate the sentiment, it really is far too late to secure absolution by bringing me the girl."
 His voice had changed, becoming deeper and harsher, with elements that didn't sound like they could come from any human throat.

Today, more than 1.1 billion people in developing countries, constituting 58 per cent of the economically active population, work in agriculture.
 The decline in proportion of the workforce in this sector must necessarily be gradual.
 An employment strategy which generates a large number of new jobs in the non-farm rural sector could contribute substantially to diversification of rural employment opportunities.
 A similar strategy has proved highly effective as an engine for growth in a number of East Asian countries, which employed crop-intensive and labour-intensive technologies to achieve increasing levels of employment and productivity in agriculture.
 Empirical evidence from these countries confirms that wherever agriculture becomes prosperous, labour becomes scarce.
 Between 1952 and 1968, land reform in Taiwan increased the number of cultivators five-fold, leading to dramatic increases in output and productivity, a shift from foodgrains to higher value-added fruit and vegetable crops, and the creation of more than 100,000 jobs in post-harvest and processing activities.
 These changes in employment led to enhanced rural incomes and purchasing power, growing domestic demand for goods and services, including manufactured goods, and further job growth.
 Land reform in South Korea during the early 1950s increased the number of owner cultivators from 50 per cent to 90 per cent and led to a 4.7 per cent annual growth in labour productivity per hectare over a 15-year period.
 Then, as agricultural technology improved and industrialization gained momentum, the proportion of South Korea’s workforce engaged in agriculture fell from 55 per cent to under 16 per cent over the following three decades.
 Thailand, which has had the fastest growth of the East Asian economies in recent years and still employs 70 per cent of its workforce in agriculture, has also attained high rates of production and employment in the rural sector through diversification in agriculture from traditional cultivation of rice and rubber to high-value crops and agro-based industries.

I moved a little closer.
 "Do you still want me to leave?"
 "Do you want to leave?
 I won't stop you if you do.
 If you can convince your mom to leave town there's even a chance you'll be safe from Brandon."
 Shivers worked their way down my spine as some of the pieces clicked into place.
 "He's like you, isn't he?"
 Alec's laugh was a bitter, humorless thing.
 "You mean a monster?
 Yes, we both feel the call of the moon.

Jasmin had about the least reason out of any girl alive to be an expert hair dresser since her naturally wavy hair could just air dry and still look like she'd spent hours working on it, but an expert she was.
 The results of her efforts on Rachel's behalf were nothing less than spectacular, and the casual-looking knot of curls and twists was wispy in all the right places.
 Even with Rachel currently an order of magnitude hotter than normal, Jasmin still captured the prize.
 Rachel's work on her behalf had resulted in a makeup job that was so incredibly understated, even us girls had a hard time detecting it.
 Her wavy brunette hair had been straightened and pulled back in what looked like an attempt to let some other girls shine for a change, but it just made her look like a goddess who'd decided to spend the night slumming.
 Given who she'd spent the last hour being surrounded by, it was no wonder Dominic was worried she was the ugly step sister.
 She needn't have worried.
 Her features were even more exotic than Jasmin's, and Rachel had chosen bright colors that made her stand out much more than usual.
 James' macho cool really was going to finally crack tonight.
 Maybe I could pull the dress off after all.

Her apartment was dingy and cluttered, mostly with books.
 Eric’s high school senior-class picture, blown up to poster size and framed, hung facing the entry door.
 As I entered, Sylvia's fierce green eyes taunted me.
 She demanded, “What’s the purpose of life?” “Give me a minute,” I said.
 “To know love and serve God,” she declared, with a hiss on "serve."
 Later she would tell me she got that answer from a priest in an orphanage where, as a teenager terrified of her own sister, she had gone to seek refuge.
 Sylvia’s challenge sent me to 1 John 4:8.
 "Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love."
 I needed to know more about love.
 I was single after seventeen years married.

 “I-I should see if I can find my way home.” “Wait.
 Listen—I think you’re more lost than you realize.” “What do you mean?” How could he tell her what he couldn’t believe himself?
 “I-I want to show you something.
 Come read my newspaper.” “We have our own.”  She turned to escape.
 He caught her wrist.
 “Wait.
 I’m not going to hurt you.
 You-you don’t know how to get home, do you?”  When she didn’t respond, he said, “Just come look at my newspaper.
 You don’t have to come inside.

I shouldn't have been surprised by the question, but I was.
 Possibly because I'd spent too much time around people like Britney who were so caught up in their own lives that they didn't really care about what was happening in mine.
 "Les Misérables.
 The music from the musical is so inspiring that I know the book must be truly wonderful."
 I let the statement hang in the air for a couple of seconds, and then finished up with the truth.
 "Of course I don't really know, because it's so big, and parts of it are so boring, that I may never manage to get through the whole thing."
 Chapter 10 The rest of the afternoon finished up on a quiet note.
 After I went back to my table, Rachel worked on some homework for a few more minutes, and then gathered up her things and slipped out.
 I decided the new guy wasn't a football player when he started gathering up his books.
 No athlete in my experience ever took that many books anywhere.

Tassels hung around his neck depicting lines and accomplishments: sky blue for receiving the calling, deep crimson for service to the guard.
 His chest bore a personalized crest, an oak leaf on an unbroken shield of gold and acorn brown.
 I watched from the trees as a rainbow of a half dozen tassels fluttered behind him where he rushed down the path toward the village.
 When I walked through the door, I saw immediately Fannie had not expected company.
 The telltale signs of a hurried cleaning spell were everywhere.
 I slipped into one of the low chairs to enjoy a bowl of berries set out for company under the guise of politeness.
 We didn’t often have visitors, and I could count on a new spruce twig the times we’d had fresh berries.
 Might as well enjoy them.
 I popped a ripe juneberry into my mouth as Aunt Fannie rounded the corner.
 She was on her way into the room, having dashed back to her stash of wine as soon as the visitor had hit the door.

He wanted to protect her, now and in the past.
 When he was sure she was asleep, he went to his own room and took out the pages he'd copied before his sister’s dance.
 Marie Tranton, born 1904 .

 It didn't tell the date of her death.
 That was odd--he was sure it had been in this section.
 His heart began racing as he scanned those pages.
 There was no mention at all of her death--or of her marriage.
 The only information was her date of birth, the names of her parents and brother, and the general family history.

The effect was ethereal.
 It was hard to imagine that any of the spun-metal stands could support anything more substantial than a box of Kleenex.
 It wasn't until we were further inside that I realized there was an entire alcove off to one side, almost completely dominated by a black grand piano.
 The piano was so breathtaking it was several seconds before I realized there was someone sitting at it.
 "Alec.

 Rachel was going on and on about some kind of problem with the pack.
 She's so excitable.
 I told her everything would be fine, but she worries so.

He was tall with green hair and with a confident bearing to his presence.
 He greeted Rodregas with a very bright smile.
 “I see that you are looking much better,” said the unknown Nymph.
 Imeralda gave the young Nymph a big hug, one that looked far more intimate than Rodregas was comfortable with and she said, “Rodregas, we are so lucky that I was able to get Jordaan to come.
 Durien was working so hard trying to heal you, but your body is so hard to work with.
 He says that the same innate magical ability that makes your body so strong also requires a lot of power to heal.
 Normally Durien can heal even a very seriously wounded person, but he could barely keep you and Doi’van alive.
 I had to leave and run to Fariste to get Jordaan to come.” She was smiling like the sun as she spoke.
 “He was so good to come and just leave at the last moment,” she added.
 Rodregas thought she was going to start hugging the Nymph again, but she caught herself and came over to him and gave him a careful hug and started fussing with his pillows.

Somehow, it seemed to have become unhinged.
 Besides, it wasn’t as if he could think of anything to say.
 All his mind could concentrate on was the feel of the elf’s soft lips on his cheek, the flowery scent of her perfume mixed with sweat, and the quick brush of her breasts against his arm.
 By the time his jaw and mind began working again, Aurelia was laughing.
 “What’s so funny?” he demanded.
 The elf smiled.
 “Nothing.
 Just a big stupid half-orc I’m going to miss.
 Bye-bye.”
 She waved and then vanished into the forest.

A woman was coming out of one house, wearing very short blue trousers, and Marie ran in the other direction.
 She had to find Rick's house!
 Being stuck in the future was bad enough, but if she couldn't find Rick again, she'd-- "Marie!"
 She turned toward his voice.
 "Rick?"
 "Where are you?"
 "Here!
 I'm lost!"
 But then she saw him and ran to him, throwing her arms around him.
 "I couldn't get back home!"

I closed my eyes and blacked out.
 I didn’t really black out but that’s what I thought at the time.
 I opened my eyes to find I was sitting on the ground next to my sleeping body.
 I saw Emily sitting there, saying nothing for once.
 Something fell off my back and I picked it up.
 It was a wooden bow, and when I reached behind my back I felt a quiver full of feathered arrows strapped there.
 I ran a finger over the smooth, dark wood and turned to see Seth crashing out of the woods.
 I smirked at him and pointed at his head.
 “You have dark blue hair.” I giggled, not knowing why I was giggling after what had just happened to us a few minutes ago.
 He frowned and pulled a piece or two out of his head.

Johnny – You’d like to think that, but there was some sort of obscure law and it all fell apart.
 Jim – How strangely inconvenient.
 Johnny – Yeah it is.

 Jim – What?
 Johnny – I feel like I’m being watched.
 Jim – What?
 Johnny – You know, like in the movie the Truman show.
 Some times I feel like cameras following my every move.

The half-orc said nothing.
 For a moment all three glanced about, the atmosphere akin to air before a thunderstorm.
 Qurrah broke the silence.
 “Woodhaven is behind us,” he said.
 “I have made mistakes, as has my brother.
 I saw you leave with him, and I know you sacrificed much to protect him.
 For this, I thank you.
 All I ask is that we speak naught of this again.
 If we are to travel together, it is my only wish.”
 “A wish gladly granted,” Aurelia said, a tiny smile finally cracking free.

Run along and get your make-up done--it's at the end of that corridor.

 He turned away before Marie could say a word.
 Rick took her hand and led her away toward the make-up room.
 "Rick, what's going on?"
 she asked.
 "Now don't get too excited--you're just an extra.
 It's not--" "I'm going to be in a movie?"
 she squealed.
 "You're going to be an extra.

I let my gaze drop, and found an unearthly pool of liquid light at my feet.
 The quiet murmur of falling water to my right kindled a burning thirst I hadn't realized I'd been feeling since I opened my eyes.
 Looking towards the waterfall, I found a shimmering ribbon of light working its way down the rock face.
 The sight was so incredibly beautiful it took me several moments to realize the tendril was the waterfall I'd been looking for.
 I reached into the dancing pool of light at my feet and smiled as my cupped hands came away filled with water that lit up my palms.
 I couldn't imagine anything more surreal.
 I might have stayed there for hours if the barest whisper of sound hadn't distracted me.
 Alec was staring at me, an expression of disapproval marring otherwise perfect features.
 "Of all the places for you to intrude, why did it have to be here?"
 For a second, surrounded as I was by such beauty, I did feel like an intruder.

He must have had experience with fire magic; the flames he produced behaved like an obedient dog.
 Mine, on the other hand, were about as compliant as a wet cat.
 Exhausted by the day’s work, I began to sway a bit.
 Chevelle led me to the base of an old willow tree and I slumped against the trunk, sliding down to lie on my back.
 Chevelle reclined against the tree, his legs coming to rest just above my head in the soft grass.
 I gazed through the immense mass of leaves and branches overhead and breathed deeply.
 I felt the need to explain the welt, and my eyes rose toward him as I lightly touched my cheek.
 “I was searching for my mother’s things…” He didn’t respond, staring straight out into the meadow, so I returned to watching the canopy of leaves.
 “I can’t remember her,” I said.
 I hadn’t discussed this with anyone before, but once I started talking, I couldn’t seem to stop.

I wondered how old it was.
 Chevelle stood, directing Ruby to stay with me until he returned.
 Steed followed him without another word.
 Ruby must have known I was curious.
 Or she just wanted to talk.
 It was hard to tell with Ruby.
 “It’s been abandoned for centuries,” she offered, making me a bed as she recounted ancient stories.
 She helped me move onto the blankets, the dizziness improved but my muscles weak and drained.
 I asked, “Why are we here?” She twisted her mouth to the side, considering her answer.
 “We were in need of shelter after your… episode.

He fought three others at the end of the afternoon; all three had won their group of matches.
 Rodregas thought that they might have been tough opponents if they had not been so beaten up.
 Between the natural durability of his body and the minor Sigil of Healing though, he was feeling fine.
 The knights were clearly trying to find the best five among the competitors.
 They were not necessarily trying to find out who was the best among the five.
 Rodregas watched several fighters that clearly were of the blood or had minor sigils, but he did not fight any that could have offered him a real challenge.
 At the end, after he defeated his final opponents, they tied a bright yellow ribbon to his upper arm and wrote down his name as a top five finisher.
 The top five got bright yellow arm bands, the sixth to tenth finishers white bands, the eleventh through fifteenth red bands, sixteenth through twentieth blue bands and twenty-first to twenty-fifth received a green band.
 Rodregas felt more nervous the next day with the archery competition.
 While luckily the knights provided the bows for all contestants, they did not have them available for practice.

A slender, frumpy-looking woman looked up from her desk as Britney and I walked in.
 I held up my form, which she took without reading it.
 "No doubt something to ensure I know you're my newest student.
 Sit over there where you won't distract Britney from just how poorly she's doing in my class.
 There's an extra book on the shelves in the back."
 Britney rolled her eyes as she went to her assigned desk, but I suspected she was actually relieved we'd been split up.
 Mrs. Campbell didn't seem like the kind of teacher you could get away with ignoring, so I retrieved an algebra book from the back of the room and sat at my desk.
 Any thoughts about finding out why hiking was off limits quickly melted away once class started.
 Math had never been my favorite subject.
 I'd always managed to pull A's or at least A-'s, but hated all of the little nitpicky rules.

Two men fell to each of their blades, bringing the total down to four.
 As Felewen lay upon the ice, a soldier stabbed down at her.
 She spun on her rear, her sword out in an arc.
 After knocking him off his feet, Felewen snapped her legs high above her, spinning her body off the ground.
 She landed on her stomach, her sword skewering the guard’s innards.
 She pulled herself to her feet with the hilt of her sword, twisted the blade, and then finished him.
 The remaining soldiers turned to flee, but there was one slight problem.
 An enormous ball of fire erupted at their feet, engulfing all three in flame.
 Two died from the horrible burns.
 A third slumped and whimpered in pain.

A lot of smiling usually, for a while at least, but only until they get annoyed that we’re too dumb to read their minds.
 Jim – Damn our infernal lack of psychic powers!
 Art – Indeed.
 The most important thing you can learn is how to play dumb.
 And you already excel at that.
 Jim – I learned from a master.
 What more can you tell me about that whole predicting thing you were going on about?
 Art – I can’t really tell you the tricks, just keep your eyes open and remember what goes on around you.
 After a while you’ll be able to at least recognize some of their quirks.
 Jim – Can you give any examples of what you’re talking about?

Although much has been learned about the various stages of social and economic development, much less is known about the actual process itself by which societies transit from one stage or level or form to another.
 As a result, our efforts to speed the transition are often haphazard, stumbling and fraught with difficulty.
 Today former colonial nations such as Vietnam and Zimbabwe strive to catch up with countries that have never been subject to foreign rule.
 The tribal nations of central Africa struggle at great cost to transform themselves into modern states.
 Even within the prosperous West, the speed and extent of progress is uneven, leading to the emergence of ‘developing countries’ within developed nations, of poverty-stricken families in inner cities with rates of chronic unemployment as high as 50 per cent or more.
 Nothing is of greater value to humanity’s quest for progress than an understanding of the development process and the means for consciously directing it more effectively.
 The tremendous economic achievements of Japan during the post-war period, followed during the last two decades by other East Asian economic powers and most recently by China, suggest that the time required for transition can be substantially abridged and the fruits of development achieved much sooner than has been accomplished by nations in the past.
 The rising expectations of people around the globe and the potential risks of failing to heed their call have added a greater sense of urgency to the quest for this knowledge.
 Eastern Europe
 The challenges posed by extremely rapid transition are nowhere more graphically depicted than in the current transition of the countries of Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the end of the Cold War and the break-up of the USSR.

A comprehensive and coordinated international effort is called for to improve the global climate for economic growth and job creation by evolving stable and supportive policies to regulate capital flows, foreign trade, debt, commodity pricing, immigration and labour movements, transfer of technology, investment, military spending and the arms trade.
 We set forth below a broad policy framework to stimulate global job growth with the aim of achieving full employment early in the twenty-first century.
 1.World Employment Programme: Raising incomes and creating jobs in the developing countries is the best way to promote global economic growth and employment generation in the coming decades.
 The World Summit on Social Development should call for a comprehensive World Employment Programme to stimulate more rapid growth in developing countries as an engine for global economic expansion.
 The International Labour Organization has operated a programme for the past two decades, but solution of the employment problem requires an integrated approach that transcends the scope of any single international agency.
 The programme should establish specific objectives and co ordinate efforts to stimulate international investment, increase labour market flexibility, promote productive skills, diffuse technology, eliminate protectionist trade policies that retard growth, increase trade between developing countries, and promote international cooperation on taxation systems to encourage more labour-oriented tax codes.
 2.Coordination of macro-economic policies: The efforts of the industrial nations to achieve higher rates of economic growth and job creation are stymied by the need to maintain macro-economic stability at the same time.
 Due to the competition between OECD members to attract financial resources, rising interest rates or falling inflation rates in one country influence the inflow and outflow of financial resources from other members of the community.
 The efforts to curb inflation at the expense of slower economic growth and job creation need not be so rigorous, if OECD members more closely coordinated their policies to support macro-economic expansion.
 A modest, relatively uniform rise in inflation rates within the OECD would not then result in a significant movement of resources or fluctuation in exchange rates.

 Bob Williams often hung around our apartment.
 About half way through the fall semester, President Kennedy got bushwhacked.
 I was so used to good people dying, I didn’t take it as hard as some did.
 College was okay, except I came to doubt I wanted to major in Philosophy when I learned the classes were less concerned with the ideas than with arguing about them.
 And as finals approached, Laura Steinhoff's boyfriend Frank Holmes stopped by our apartment and pitched us a better idea.
 Better especially for me whose sole living hero was Jack Kerouac.
 Frank wanted to take off driving and stop in New Orleans for Mardi Gras.
 After that, we could just point the car north or east and go.
 So Bob and I dropped out of college after one semester, even though we risked getting drafted and sent to war.

These days, with my big kids and Pam off in the world on their own, Zoë is my only real treasure.
 Around the time she was born, I often wrote for the San Diego Reader.
 My editor asked me for a story they would call “Old Man, New Baby”.
 Here is a condensed version: It could be a gender difference, or an individual one.
 All I know is that I never thought much about having kids until I had one.
 Laura, my first wife, wanted kids.
 So when they weren’t happening, being the agreeable fellow I can be now and then, I got a simple operation and zap.
 The greatest surprise of my life has been the transformation of my heart the day my daughter joined us in the outer world.
 Back up.
 I had been a sensitive, affectionate kid, as kids go, until I hit adolescence and people started dying.

Dominic looked up from Jess.
 "Vincent and Cassie cut Jess and Isaac off from the rest of us."
 Rachel leaned in so she could whisper.
 "Jess is terrified of what Vincent and Brandon will do to her if they get a chance.
 She collapsed, and then everyone stormed the area."
 The limo hit a particularly nasty bump, and a wave of pain drove questions about what exactly Brandon had threatened out of my mind.
 I'd never noticed how bad the roads between school and Alec's house were.
 Each jostle sent waves of agony up my leg, and Jess's quiet sobs kept time to my suppressed gasps.
 It was one of the worst half hours of my life, and by the time we made it to Alec's house, I felt like I'd been wrung out.
 Alec yelled for Donovan and the first-aid kit as he carried me inside, and set me down in the living room.

 "Were--" "Marie!"
 She looked up in shock to see her brother in the kitchen entrance.
 "John!"
 He ran and grabbed her, twirling her around.
 "Where did you come from?"
 "It's a long story."
 When he set her down, she pushed back to look up at him.

Rodregas said, “Yes, we do.
 You seem like an honorable squire, would you also like a minor Sigil of Healing?” He thought she was going to laugh at his question at first, but then she simply whispered, “That simple?” “Almost.” Rodregas said.
 “Promise to say nothing about this, and also promise that you will use your sigil wisely and that if you have a chance to help us you will do so.” “You are creating your own little Shadow Order?” she asked.
 She was referring to stories of secrete orders of knighthood that lived in the ‘shadows.’ Rodregas started to say no but then thought the idea actually had some advantages, “Welcome to the Order of…,” he paused.
 He almost said “The Celestial Lions.” But while he might be filled with the essence of a Celestial animal, he stood with a being of elemental power and one of infernal power.
 “The Lion,” he simply finished.
 It was the only real symbol that he could think of.
 “What of the others?” she asked.
 Rodregas was confused by her question and asked, “What others?” Karun answered, “There are a lot of very good squires here, honorable men and women who could benefit from the sigil.” Rodregas’ head was spinning at the idea.
 They were already being hunted by the Immortalists, and gaining some allies was not a bad idea.

He had killed before, but this was different.
 This was a complete surrender to the murderer within.
 He thought of his vow to Velixar, and also to his brother.
 Obedience.
 Loyalty.
 He had sworn his entire life to them.
 What else did he know?
 What else could he be?
 He thought of Aurelia only once before he spoke.
 Her face was a white knife in the darkness of his mind, and he buried her deep within his heart as he yielded to the wisdom of his brother.

The end of her staff dislodged two more of his teeth.
 The soldier panicked and turned to run, but found his feet entangled.
 Aurelia marched over, remembering how difficult it had been to strike Harruq and how strong a blow he could take without showing pain.
 “Are you as strong as a half-orc?” she asked.
 Her staff collided with his ribs.
 He curled up at the blow, crying out in pain.
 Guess not, she thought.
 A shove put him on his back.
 He pleaded to her, sputtering blood, but she ignored him.
 “Some people should not reproduce,” she said.

Instead of what happened, I tell Cliff I’m going on the road to find Kerouac.
 Then I drive Route 66 and the turnpike from Chicago, 3000 miles to the Left Bank Bar in Lindenhurst, Long Island, where Bobby Casso introduces Jack and me.
 We talk about everything, including God and tequila, and at the right moment, I tell him about the light.
 His eyes open wider.
 Still in my dream, I'm back home when a postcard arrives, from Jack, who writes that he’s gone and found his daughter, Jan, who would otherwise also die young, and they’re going to live in peace, joy, and love, now and for eternity.
 And they might help save Neal Cassady.

 While going through my boxes of Eric’s treasures, I find myself hoping that somehow God, in eternity, will bless Sylvia in spite of her meanness.
 I loved her, though in a guarded way.
 I tried to help her, and she gave me plenty in return, most of it dark, but nevertheless worth pondering.

I heard my mom and dad walking downstairs, talking excitedly about where they thought I was going to go today.
 I rolled off my bed and walked sleepily over to my dresser to pull out a pair of jeans and a shirt.
 After I had pulled the shirt over my head, I grabbed my half empty traveling bag and headed down stairs.
 I dropped my bag near the door and walked over to the kitchen table.
 My mom had placed a full plate of eggs and toast on the table; I sat down and started to eat.
 My mom hurried over and glanced at her watch.
 “You have about a half an hour until you have to leave.
 Eat up.” I responded with a quick shovel of food.
 Within 25 minutes, I was standing by the door with my stomach all queasy.
 My mom rushed forward and gave me a quick hug.

The collision happened before Rodregas was fully expecting it and he felt himself hit the ground and hit it hard.
 “Great,” Rodregas muttered to himself, “He has a Dire Steed and full plate armor.” Rodregas rolled over and pushed himself up, Doom Hoof stood nosing the sand looking for food.
 “The damned beast should be pulling plows not in a tournament for knighthood.” Rodregas thought.
 Rodregas’ opponent was starting to turn around, probably to ask for his surrender.
 Rodregas painfully climbed back up on Doom Hoof and circled the horse back to Doi’van for a new lance and shield.
 Doi’van handed over the equipment and said, “How did you break a shield on a single joust?” Rodregas grunted a non-committal response, and tried to find a comfortable position to hold his lance.
 “This is our last shield so when it is gone, we are done,” Doi’van said.
 Rodregas nodded in response, he had to get right back to the tilt, as it was still his turn to fight.
 Rodregas’ opponent was waiting for his return and was off full speed as soon as the flag fell.
 Doom Hoof was barely into a trot before the new opponent came into range.

These events raise questions about the rights of both nations and their citizens that have to be addressed theoretically before the role of international organizations in these affairs can be determined properly.
 Does a minority group within a country have the right to proclaim itself independent on the basis of its desire for self-governance and in defiance of the claims of the majority on the property and resources they possess?
 Does a national government, whether elected or in power by force, that is unable to protect its citizens against famine and civil strife have the right to insist on its sovereignty and independent action in the face of the persecution or extermination of its own people?
 What is the responsibility of the international community for preventing or alleviating crises within societies?
 What should be the limits placed on international involvement in the internal affairs of countries that, at least momentarily, are unable to help themselves?
 The sanctity of the sovereign state, like the sanctity of private property in a capitalist society, is a fundamental principle of the nation state system on which the present world community is based.
 Like the protectors of private property, the guardians of the sovereign state vigorously resist each attempt to limit its scope or qualify its power – although in both instances there are obvious and well-recognized limits and qualifications.
 The sensitivity over the issue of sovereignty – especially among former colonies and victims of imperialist aggression – is quite understandable in view of the fact that the emergence of modern nation states over the last two centuries occurred during a period when imperialist wars and colonial conquests were accepted as part of the normal conduct of international relations.
 It is a measure of the world’s progress in this century that this standard of conduct is no longer tolerated by the international community.
 The formulation of current policy on racial memories of past exploitation or persecution is no more appropriate or conducive to human progress, however, than the false conception of policies based on an exaggerated sense of pride or egocentric self-importance derived from the glory of forceful conquest in the past.

My eyes opened in horror as I saw the small trickle of blood fall from a hole in the right wing.
 Then we started to fall.
 Chapter 9
 I screamed so loud that my ears felt like they were going to pop.
 We plummeted to the ground, falling closer and closer… Oh man, I thought and closed my eyes.
 Don’t look, don’t look, don’t look… “Really!” Seth yelled at the sky.
 “This brings new meaning to ‘things can’t get any worse!’” I gripped furiously to the limp dragon.
 I was falling to my death: so this is how it was going to end.
 I never pictured it this way; I thought I would die a little more heroically, not screaming like a little girl.
 “Not now Seth,” Emily screamed at him.

I stopped.
 The voice had come out of nowhere.
 The time is near.
 The voice whispered as faintly as the breeze.
 What, I thought, was that?
 You must stop it.
 I gritted my teeth in annoyance.
 I’m sick and tired of your riddles, whoever you are.
 Just give me a straight answer or I can’t do anything.
 It all comes down to this.

God is me, in me, you know?
 That’s what she’s saying.
 That’s what she’s always been saying, but people couldn’t hear her, for whatever reason.
 They wouldn’t listen.
 Just like I say in “Burn my Bridge”, you know?
 “There’s a black and white photograph/On my finger is a tiny bird.”  You know?
 It’s like they can’t hear me now, after they all were so intent on being Black Lung acolytes, or whatever.
 Now, these same cats, these same sycophants and hangers-on, they’re up there, pronouncing on me, on Lor, on my new stuff as if I’m not a human being, too.
 As if I can’t be hurt, am impregnable, a force instead of a feeling, bleeding child, you know?
 Like we all are.

Thomas and I also knew that the only other consistent thing in our life was each other.
 We were very close in size and we were often mistaken as twins although I had blond hair and he had brown.
 We fought like all brothers did, but we had always shared a bedroom and we talked each other to sleep every night.
 I never remember my mother dating much, so I think she was careful not to introduce us to any suitor until it was more serious.
 She eventually met a man who she was serious about, Dino.
 He would sometimes bring food we were not accustomed to eating, like steak.
 I had no memory of any man ever giving us a gift or anything of the sort before, but occasionally he would bring us a trinket to our mother’s delight.
 He was a big man with a dark complexion and jet-black hair and he would often talk on the phone in his native Greek.
 Thomas and I had never heard someone speak in a foreign language so it was intriguing.
 My mom soon married Dino and we officially had a stepfather.

“It is actually a topic of much debate among magicians.
 I go along with the belief that there is no such thing as ‘mortal’ magic.
 While we don’t have time now to go over all the proof, the general thought is that mortals are truly just animals and don’t produce magic.
 It is only our connection to other realms that provides us power.
 Mana is the raw energy of magic no matter what its source.
 You can use mana from any source to cast spells.” He looked around at the three of them to make sure they understood.
 Rodregas felt like he was back in a classroom, as he had been as a child in the Cathedral of the Knights.
 In truth all three were very interested, as magic was something that was very much affecting their lives at the moment.
 Rodregas noticed that while Imeralda’s expression was one of simple enjoyment at refining her knowledge with an expert, Doi’van’s seemed almost made of rock.
 It seemed as if he feared that if he moved, his inclusion in the discussion would be challenged.

He had worked there since he graduated the program and he assured me they would do their best to help Brandon.
 The facility where Brandon was staying was nearly a nine-hour drive from our home.
 We talked to Brandon on the phone occasionally and every time we did it was as if a cloud was slowly lifting and he was starting to think more clearly.
 He seemed to be growing up.
 He had never really matured like his younger brother because in his world of drugs he was not living reality.
 Easter was rolling around and we planned on visiting him with the family, but only if he completed certain parts of his program by Easter.
 If so, he would be allowed a LOA (Leave Of Absence) for the day.
 If not, we would have Easter with him at the facility.
 He would have been an inpatient for over two months by then, and the Narconon program would keep him as long as they needed until he was ready to graduate or until he left on his own.
 We could only hope that Brandon stayed with the program and left only when he had the tools to stay off the dope.

Happy?”
 “Far from it.”
 Aurelia crossed her legs, tossed back her hair, and then leaned her head on her hands as she stared into the fire.
 “I want you to listen to me, alright Harruq?”
 “Sure.”
 He glanced down, uncomfortable and saddened that Aurelia refused to look him in the eye.
 “Velixar is not who you think he is.
 He isn’t _what_ you think he is.
 He tried to kill me, Harruq.
 He enjoyed every second we fought.

Since it's so early, why don't I do that before we go out to the garden?"
 He started to say that he wasn't hungry, but he wanted to put off her walk in the garden as long as possible.
 So he helped her make breakfast and then managed to swallow most of his.
 Out in the garden, he took her hands, gazing down at her.
 "I won't kiss you like I did yesterday.
 But I want you to know how very much I love you."
 She smiled, raising her lips to his for a brief kiss.
 As she wandered off, Rick focused his mind on the TV shows they'd watched last night.
 He replayed all the details of the plots, being sure that he saw, in his mind's eye, all the colors.
 Then he began thinking about planes, remembering his trip with Marie to Los Angeles.

“Miss don’t you think that Her Majesty would have this all planned out?
 You don’t have to worry.” Seth twirled his sword.
 “Why not, we have to tell our parents something.” “Sir, don’t worry about a thing.
 All you need to do is go home.
 Everything has been arranged.” “What do you mean, arranged?” Seth asked sharply.
 The dwarf seemed to bounce up and down.
 “It has sir, but I don’t know what her majesty did.
 All I know is that all of you have to go home to get ready.” My mind whirled with all this new information.
 “Wait, why do we have to go?
 What is this destiny?” The dwarf gave a feeble smile.

He made amends to all of us and he unsuccessfully tried to fight back the tears as he continued.
 He spoke candidly about all of the lessons he had learned to help him deal with a life without the need for drugs.
 He talked about how he had learned to deal with the nightmares and guilt he once drowned in drugs.
 I never thought such words of wisdom and reflection would ever come out of his mouth but they did.
 We all sobbed uncontrollably as we could now understand what demons he fought and how our son was back.
 We could finally understand drug addiction.
 A group hug involving our entire family erupted during the ceremony as Brandon finished speaking.
 I am sure nobody minded the interruption, as those in all phases of the program were witnessing the healing of a family.
 Perhaps it gave them hope as well, and the thought that one day they could hold their loved ones and heal the hurt they had caused.
 Individual hugs from Brandon followed for each of us, and I thought he would squeeze me to death.

For he and his brother, that was life.
 What the abyss was he doing asking for work?
 A swelling of nerves in his gut almost forced him to leave.
 Several men in front of him turned away, dejected or angry.
 He didn’t hear the reasons why and didn’t want to know.
 The idea of so much money, more than enough to buy warm food and clean drink, kept him there.
 At last it was his turn, and he approached the table where Alvrik sat chewing on a piece of bone long since void of meat.
 “You,” he said before Harruq could mutter a word.
 “You don’t look like all the others.”
 “I’m not like the others.”

She seemed to know who I was, and after identifying herself as Mrs. Pendely, proceeded to quiz me about which classes I'd been in at my last school.
 She stumbled a bit when I told her I hadn't enrolled in classes before moving.
 I didn't offer any additional information, so she tried to defuse the awkwardness by asking about electives.
 I answered numbly, picking out classes nearly at random.
 I already knew a school this size wouldn't have anything truly interesting.
 I'd never been willing to dedicate the time required to learn a musical instrument.
 I've always been passable at drawing scenery, but anything more complicated than a stick figure gives me fits, so art was out too.
 Unless possibly the teacher liked Neolithic cave drawings.
 By the time I surfaced from my musings, Mrs. Pendely had printed my schedule out on an ancient piece of machinery, handed me a map of the school and a locker assignment, and then dashed off a handwritten note to my first teacher.
 I somehow found my first class before the bell rang.

Marie was in a window seat, squeezing Rick's hand as she looked out the window.
 "The plane goes really fast down the runway until the air lifts it."
 "It's so big and has all these people in it.
 How does it stay in the air without falling?"
 "I don't know much about aerodynamics."
 "About what?"
 "What keeps the plane in the air."
 Marie couldn't wait to feel the airplane move.
 It was hard to believe that it could stay up in the air.
 She'd seen airplanes before, but she'd never been in one.

"Do you know why those guys kept throwing the frisbee to you?"
 "To watch me jump and bend."
 When his eyes showed surprise, she told him, "I know I'm naive, Rick, but I'm not totally stupid.
 After all, you stared at me all morning."
 "That's different," he muttered, glancing away.
 "Why?"
 When he didn't answer, she took his hand, lacing her fingers with his.
 "They tried to make a game of picking me up and throwing me into the waves, but I wouldn't let them.
 I didn't let them touch me.
 Not even to help me up."

Democracy, Peace and Development
 The first is a revolutionary movement from authoritarianism to democracy that has travelled around the world during the past decade.
 The initial wave swept through Latin America in the early 1980s, replacing military regimes in Peru, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Paraguay and Bolivia.
 In 1979, 12 out of 19 Latin American countries had authoritarian governments.
 By 1993, every country except Cuba and Haiti had a democratically elected government.
 Glasnost and perestroika in the USSR initiated a second and more powerful tide of freedom that expanded rapidly through Eastern Europe and then to other continents, in the same way that India’s attainment of freedom from colonial rule gave birth to a host of freedom movements and new nations after the Second World War.
 The number of single-party or military states and people under autocratic rule has fallen dramatically since 1980, and the trend continues.
 This shift to multi-party democracy, when coupled with a free press and an independent judiciary, vastly reduces the threat of large-scale wars similar to those that have twice shaken the world in this century.
 Three factors are at play in most conflict situations: the absence of developed democratic institutions, the absence or abuse of fundamental human rights, and the inability to make those choices in the management of public policy on which good governance depends.
 Authoritarian governments find justification for their existence in the presence of external threats to national security, in times of war and during periods of imperialist expansionism.

What I had was already too much.
 I couldn’t fathom the pain Chevelle had suffered, surely a hundred times mine at the loss of my mother.
 His mother… his father… each member of his family?
 How much loss had he endured?
 Tears streamed down my face.
 Chevelle took a step toward me and I was struck by fear.
 He must despise me.
 That was why he’d become my watcher.
 He gave a curt nod at my reaction, his head still dipped as he walked away.
 I wanted to speak but the words choked me.

 With regret he put his own wishes aside.
 "Is that the bigger pair?
 If not, let's get some bigger ones."
 "No--these are the small ones.

 They bought the bigger pair and two shirts, and Marie wore the jeans and the red and navy shirt from the store.
 "Thank you for the clothes, Rick," she said, smiling up at him.
 "You're welcome.

I could claim ignorance.
 The entire clan thought I was an imbecile in any case.
 Maybe I would just see how close I could get.
 Maybe just to try… And then I was there, standing in front of the Council building and walking in.
 My attempt at stealth was a poor endeavor, but no one ever seemed to pay much attention to me anyway.
 I casually leaned around a doorway to see into the next room, where a small group of villagers stood, blocking my way.
 They spoke in low voices, and as I tried to figure a way past, something seized my attention.
 “Evelyn has been a model citizen… doesn’t seem right…” My nerves twitched as the worry from that day returned.
 As I remembered the risk I’d put myself under coming here.
 I strained to listen but could only pick out parts of the conversation.

﻿Gardner Remembers: The Lost Tapes an interview with Creole Myers (PLUS: Memphis musicologist, Linda Israel’s mini-biography of the man, “The Growth and Death of Buddy Gardner” Corey Mesler
 Copyright © 2011 by Corey Mesler Pocketful of Scoundrel/SmashWords Edition www.pocketofscoundrel.wordpress.com www.kuboapress.wordpress.com

 The Growth and Death of Buddy Gardner by Dana Illsire © 1975
 You know Buddy “Slipshod” Gardner from his later solo work, the early seventies stuff when he latched onto the singer/songwriter craze begun probably by Sweet Baby James.
 You know him for his albums “Rain and Other Distractions” or “I Was a Child When Smaller.”  But this is the story of headier days, days when the Overton Park Shell was a magical place, the later rainbow implied.
 When Buddy played lead guitar and sang for Black Lung, a blues rock band with a loyal Memphis following.

Earlier?
 I can’t do a timeline, man, not even of my own life—some of it is such a blur.
 Is it like that for everyone?
 I have a memory of our family kitchen before school, oatmeal warming in a pan on the stove, my father dunking his folded toast into his coffee, and the plastic radio tuned to some “hits” station, probably WHBQ.
 This was the same radio from which I would later hear about deaths: Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Martin Luther King.
 Shit, I still have that little radio—I kept it because it seemed important.
 (laughs) It was my mother’s kitchen radio—it’s still around here somewhere.
 And, on this particular morning of oatmeal and familial familiarities, a song emanated from that plastic box, bellowing something about a “black branch with blood that kept dripping.” You know?
 And, “a white ladder all covered with water.”  I thought, holy hell.
 Of course, by this time, I was making my own music, fixing to go out on my own, and, in a way, I saw Dylan as a map, as a way out into the world.

 Torn Excerpt The silvery light of a nearly-full moon should have been comforting.
 For most people it would've been peaceful even, but it pulled at my anger with surprising strength as I bounded across the arid Southern-Utah terrain.
 Darkly-furred, four-legged shapes ghosted through the darkness on either side of me as we slid between the softly-glowing pillars of trees.
 Jasmin, arguably the closest thing I had to a best friend, dove through a latticework of light and then it was my turn to feel the undergrowth grasping at my fur in an effort to slow my progress.
 The warm evening breeze carried a host of aromas too subtle for mere human noses to identify.
 In our four-footed forms each molecule was unconsciously sorted and cataloged, leaving us free to concentrate on the elusive scent of our prey.
 The other pack, a portion at least, was less than a mile away, far enough into our territory for it to be a killable offense if they were caught.

 It’s more than a rumor.

 BG:  	Me, too.
 As you know, I’ve gone out of my way to squelch such things—any artist would.
 Except maybe Zappa who seems to embrace the concept of bootleg albums.
 Pete has gone after a few people, but these succubi who produce such things are like mercury.
 You think you have them pinned down and they squirt away.
 CM:  	What’s on it, and how did these recordings get circulated?

I heard muffled voices around me as I regained consciousness.
 My head throbbed slightly, and so did my side and my tongue.
 That explained why I had tasted blood; I must have bitten it.
 For a second I thought I had returned to my human self when I heard a blast of fire that probably came from Emily.
 “Seth when will she wake up?” a voice said.
 Then I realized it was Emily.
 “She’s alive and she’ll wake up soon.
 Stop nagging me,” a different voice said that was obviously Seth’s.
 He was really close to me because I could feel his breath on my face and his voice was very loud.
 Which wasn’t helping my throbbing head at all.

Seizing this opportunity requires, most importantly of all, a change in awareness, attitude and perspective.
 Several ideas will be of abiding value in our endeavour to make the most of this rare moment.
 Our present problems and future potentials can only be understood when viewed from a wider historical perspective that avoids getting lost in the media-driven drama and intensity of momentary crisis and short-term trends.
 As recent global action to protect the environment amply demonstrates, public awareness and understanding are growing too rapidly and becoming too important in global affairs for us to rely on the present positions of governments or current public sentiment as gauges of what may be achieved in the near future.
 More reliable indices of what is possible are the underlying currents that are rapidly raising the value of the human being, bringing nations together in ever-closer co-operation and mutual interdependence, and pressing the international community to raise its goals.
 The world is blind to the measure of its own accomplishments.
 We need fully to recognize the astonishing magnitude of the achievements of the present century and fully to understand the process that made them possible.
 This process expresses itself as scientific, technological, commercial, political, economic, social and cultural development.
 But its driving force is social and psychological.
 Its prime mover is human beings.

Davis was her fiancé, and she had no business kissing Rick, no business sitting in his kitchen in nothing but his pajama top.
 Reddening, Marie set her glass down and headed for the stairs.
 “I’m going to take a shower.” She couldn’t believe what she’d done.
 She could almost excuse herself for kissing Rick in Hollywood, say that he’d been part of the dream.
 But this morning .
 .
 .
 this morning she hadn’t even thought about walking in the garden, she’d kissed Rick as casually as if she did it every morning, and she'd worn nothing but his pajama top to breakfast without giving it a thought.
 She'd acted as if .

We should have a Council meeting on it, I’m sure.
 Poor, poor thing.
 I stayed where I sat, forcing my eyes to the ground.
 But then I pictured the smirk on her face as she mocked me to the villagers, to Council, and couldn’t stop the resentment from boiling up.
 My ears rang with it.
 “Choo!” I glanced up at Evelyn through the jagged line of my bangs.
 “A… a… choo!” she wheezed.
 Elves didn’t sneeze.
 Fairies sneezed.
 Forest creatures sneezed.

Money, information, education, technology, public opinion, training, administrative decisions, transport, and communication are powerful social forces and resources.
 Their productivity can be increased by increasing the speed with which they are employed, in the same way that land productivity can be raised by increasing cultivation from one to two cropping seasons per year.
 In the most industrially advanced nations, the velocity of money is roughly 2.5 to 3 times higher than in the average developing country.
 Removing administrative red tape and inefficiencies in the banking system can multiply the use value and productivity of real money, because the same money can be utilized for more transactions.
 The same is true for information, technology, training, transport and other factors.
 Increasing the speed of dissemination of information and new technology can accelerate the creation of new businesses and new jobs.
 In many developing countries, inefficient bureaucracies are slow to take decisions, issue licences, review applications, sanction loans, and amend legislation.
 This inefficiency directly impacts on the pace of development.
 Streamlining and expediting decision making and the movement of other social resources is a highly effective strategy for spurring development.
 Comparative scales need to be created to measure the movement of each of these social forces within and between nations.

Marie was too stunned for a moment to move.
 Finally she walked into her father's embrace, glancing at her mother, who simply smiled at her.
 Apparently she'd prepared her father and brother well.
 They decided to leave for Cape Cod two weeks from Friday.
 Marie thought about the bathing suit Rick had bought her.
 Her father would kill her if he ever saw her in such a thing, she mused with a smile.
 "What are you smiling about?"
 John asked her.
 "Hmmm?
 Oh, nothing.

That was why he’d been foolish enough to ask Kim to marry him, he now realized.
 He was much more cautious now.
 In fact, Ted said he’d gone to the opposite extreme.
 But he’d finally realized that there were worse things than being lonely.
 He wouldn’t have been lonely if he’d married Kim or Gina or Sabrina, but he wouldn’t have been happy.
 Even sex was no longer enough to motivate him to get into a relationship like those.
 He wanted someone he could be completely at ease with.
 He wanted someone he could relax with when he came home from work, not someone he had to work to please.
 All his married buddies told him he was dreaming, that marriage was a strain, a series of trade-offs.
 But he couldn’t help hoping there was something better than that.

Though it was much less severe this time.
 I was simply enveloped in tranquility.
 “Ruby…” Her curls had tumbled back and my complaint fell short as I was distracted by her ears.
 “Hmm?” she answered.
 I reached up to feel my own ears as I considered hers.
 I had always hidden mine behind hair, never braiding it back or putting it up to expose them.
 Not that I could have pulled off the intricate braiding and designs of the other elves.
 But my ears were clearly more rounded than everyone else’s, almost blunt.
 Ruby’s were different, too.
 Hers were more angular though, long and almost pointed at the tip.

If we're still around when they do, things will get ugly."
 Part of me wanted to break down into a gibbering wreck.
 The rest of me just nodded calmly, and turned to head upstairs as Isaac politely passed me, apparently on his way to the kitchen.
 Alec gently grasped my shoulder before I'd even managed to take a step.
 "There isn't time.
 We have to go now."
 As soon as we were out the front door, Alec motioned for me to jump on his back, and then we were off with a speed I suspected an Olympic athlete couldn't have matched.
 The lane between our house and the road flew by faster than I'd ever driven it in a car.
 The wind created by our passage was strong enough to make my eyes tear up, but I resisted the urge to close them.
 I occasionally saw shadowy shapes darting through the trees ahead or to either side of us, but there wasn't any way to be sure it was Isaac and Jasmin instead of Brandon and his entire pack.

Greg: that sounds both exciting and dangerous.
 Wait a minute… haven’t we met before?
 I swear we’ve had this conversation before, and you look very familiar
 Cindy:  it’s both, it’s a fantastic adrenaline rush, the bull and the crowds all watching you, it’s like being an action hero or a firefighter or something.
 Greg:  Ummm, hello?
 Cindy:  really, what do you do?
 Greg:  Are you listening to me?
 Hello?
 Cindy:  Really?

He looked pleased.
 “Again,” he said as he stepped back and released my hands.
 The meadow seemed to open as a circle of fire grew in front of me.
 I tried to see past it, through the flames to Chevelle, and then it was gone.
 He was further back now, raising his right hand so a stream of fire followed it, arcing in my direction.
 I was afraid I wouldn’t be able to extinguish it before it hit me.
 My feet were frozen in place.
 I could only think of one thing: Fight fire with fire.
 I flung my arm toward the incoming stream of flames and a tongue of fire akin to a dragon’s shot out and collided with it.
 I was shocked.

You do the Order a disservice to make him a Knight of the Soaring Heavens.” Van’dret’s voice was slow and reasonable sounding and he spoke not so much to the Grand Marshal as to the audience.
 “I but follow the rules of the Order as they have stood for unknown centuries, Ambassador.
 While there are many things that go into raising a squire to knighthood, the tournament is the exception.
 The rules are simple; win and you win knighthood.
 While undue bloodshed can disqualify you, a single death during the tournament is not unusual.” While the Grand Marshal spoke, he did not look at the audience.
 He looked at Van’dret and he did not look happy at the interruption.
 “But clearly he already has a greater sigil; no man can fight like that who does not have one.
 He is an impostor.
 He steals this knighthood from more deserving squires,” Van’dret said.
 At this Rodregas saw many people nodding, but he remained silent.

CM: 	I thought you went to Idlewild in 1st grade.
 It’s been written you went to Idlewild.
 BG: 	It must be true then.
 Who’s writing my story?
 (laughs) Ok.  As has been documented my first musical instrument was a ukulele.
 My dad bought it for me, I think at Guitar and Drum City, which used to be on Summer Avenue in Memphis.
 I was, I don’t know, seven, eight..
 I didn’t take any lessons or anything—I’m not sure my folks could have afforded them.
 But, when I picked up that little stringed toy, really, it was as if I knew it already, as if I’d been there before, in a dream, in a previous incarnation, Lor might say.

Ruby’s whip cracked in front of me and I knew the advance had gotten too far.
 And I was tied to a wall.
 Why hadn’t they killed me already?
 I waited for the flames.
 What came instead was far more excruciating.
 I expected to collapse as my body disconnected from my mind, but the vines held me in place.
 I saw a few final flickers of the battle before my eyes looked toward the sky, rolling back into my head.
 I had no way of forming a coherent thought or I might have been afraid.
 Chapter Seventeen A Fitting End
 I was surprised, in my dreams, that I wasn’t already dead.

Normally Mom's enthusiasm was fairly catching.
 You expect that kind of energy in a child; when it comes from an adult it's hard not to react in kind.
 It didn't manage to infect me this time, but it did help focus me on the here and now.
 I figured I owed her for that, so I tried to suppress my generally ungracious nature.
 I even let her lead me up the creaky stairs to show me the 'amazing view' for the third time.
 Mom pulled the mirrors out of my hands as soon as I reached the larger bedroom, and nudged me towards the window.
 "Admit it, Adri, we didn't get sunsets like this very often in Minnesota."
 "Adriana," I corrected automatically, trying to avoid thinking about where my nickname had come from.
 The sunset was beautiful, just starting to turn the sky pink as a prelude to the glorious oranges that would no doubt follow.
 It was the kind of thing that Mom was always trying to capture with her camera, but which never seemed to turn out quite as good as the real thing.

Once more Ravenhurr yelled out in his melodious voice the trigger words for the next part of the ritual, “Mana faria podia ricoria.” It was now or never for Rodregas to strike.
 Rodregas raised his arm up and threw his club forward with all his strength.
 There was no time to see if his club hit Junnit or if the half AElfin maiden ran.
 Rodregas half ran and half jumped to the next circle, where Ravenhurr stood with raised arms.
 Ravenhurr was focused on his inner magic and was not prepared for his own guards’ sudden action.
 Rodregas grabbed Ravenhurr’s arm and his belt, and using his weight and momentum against Ravenhurr, threw him bodily into the circle of colorful crystals where the half AElf maiden had stood moments ago.
 Ravenhurr, in an amazing act of balance, almost caught himself.
 He seemed to defy gravity as he hung in the air.
 Rodregas tried to reach out to push Ravenhurr into the circle, but before his hand touched the sorcerer, Ravenhurr lost his balance and fell into the circle.
 The moment that Ravenhurr crossed into the circle he started to burn.

The thought made me flush.
 I was staring into someone’s eyes.
 But as quickly as I had come upon him, he was gone.
 He turned from me without a word and disappeared in a few long strides.
 I watched him go.
 Short dark hair, dark eyes, and a large, strong build.
 He certainly wasn’t from this clan.
 Junnie cleared her throat.
 “Freya?” I hadn’t realized she was watching me from the open door.
 I flushed again.

They couldn’t answer simple questions coherently.
 They babbled and told those outrageous stories.
 They were sick.
 When my wife and I heard sirens or the phone rang late at night, we always thought the worst.
 Certain police or crime television shows would give us lumps in our throats as we would silently look at each other and know we were thinking the same thing… that might be our son.
 One afternoon while I was at work, Lisa was trying to help Brandon out by organizing some of his bills.
 Brandon told her that he needed to run a quick errand.
 She called me later that day and said she had lost track of him and he wasn’t returning her calls or answering his phone.
 All the usual horrible thoughts began to surface in our minds.
 The day turned into night and we still hadn’t heard from him.

I rubbed my sore back and looked around, taking in the dead looking trees and shadows.
 “Where are we?” “I don’t know, Jazell.
 The creature must have been a setup to bring us here,” he replied.
 “I think I know who did it.” “It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure that out, Seth,” I pointed out.
 I looked around.
 “Where are the others?” Seth went pale.
 “I don’t know Jazell, they aren’t here.
 They’re just gone.” My stomach twisted into a knot.
 We had always been a group of four and now it was just the two of us.
 The ghost girl’s words came back to me.

Later that day.
 An art gallery.
 Several pedestals with ‘art’, one being a cardboard box supposedly filled with ceramic pieces.
 And several paintings are on display.
 The art work all has spotlights on it, in addition to the regular lighting.
 Several people are looking at the creations and acting like they are holding conversations as they move about and look at the exhibit.
 Liz and her mom are speaking apart from the crowd.
 Jim is in the background studying a painting, wearing a trench coat with the hood up some dark sunglasses and a set of Groucho Marx glasses, facing away from Liz and her mother.
 Cleo is smoking, from time to time she lights up a new one.
 Cleo – Your show is going fabulously darling.

Where I'm stuck is: the Brother explains that his desire to live in faithful, relentless companionship with God began with adoration.
 I wish I knew French and could read the original.
 But it has taken me decades to gain a meager command of Spanish.
 So I resort to an English dictionary, look up "adore" and all I find are synonyms: worship; revere, venerate; and one somewhat helpful description: deep, rapturous love.
 That one rings truest.
 According to my vocabulary, if we adore something, we are drawn to it and resist separation.
 Its presence comforts, inspires, provides us with hope and meaning.
 The thought of losing it may terrify or leave us in despair.
 I feel all that about my kids.
 I have felt somewhat the same about a few others, at least for a time.

It is ironic that the opposition to this resolution and justification for the continued possession and possible use of nuclear weapons come solely from the most militarily, politically and economically powerful group of nations, which are militarily without adversary and at the same time in the best position to afford and institute alternative means for their national security.
 Here lies the real key: the insistence of the few most powerful nations on perceiving security in their own terms, and their insatiable urge to achieve ever more of it for themselves at the expense of greater insecurity for others and the world as a whole, even though their goal can never be achieved on this unilateral basis.
 During the Cold War, nuclear weapons were legitimized by the five permanent members of the Security Council which are the nuclear weapon states.
 Now that it is over, the governments of these nations seek to justify continued possession and the option to use these weapons, even while exerting every possible pressure to stop proliferation to other countries.
 The very logic which the nuclear weapon states rely on to support this policy, however, makes the acquisition of these weapons extremely attractive to non-nuclear powers.
 So long as their possession and possible use is tolerated and justified, the relatively low cost of production and high threat potential of these weapons offer strong incentives for other states to acquire them.
 It is unrealistic to expect that any system of international controls or inspections can prevent their eventual acquisition by states that decide to develop them and have the advanced scientific capabilities to do so.
 From the inception of nuclear weapons, two things have been clear.
 There can be no victors in a nuclear war and there is no credible defence against these weapons.
 Confidential studies by NATO in the 1960s concluded that the costs of a nuclear exchange to either party would be so great that the weapons were essentially unusable.

“Buddy Gardner was a gentleman in a jerk business,” Officer Milton remembers.
 This mildness, this Southern gentleman perception, follows Buddy to this day.
 It’s hard to find someone to speak ill of him, even those he later abandoned or stepped on on his way to the top.
 He is often compared to courtly though dipsomaniacal photographer Bill Eggleston, a friend of Buddy’s from those acme days.
 The cover photograph of Black Lung’s Pepper Records album, Turntable Poison, is an unaccredited Eggleston photograph.
 (It is, of course, a weathered Sinclair sign, imbued with the enchantment Mr. Eggleston brought to all his work, a divergence quite inexplicable.)
 Buddy was loved, revered.
 He was not held to the same rules as everyone else.
 So it goes with the great.
 And when Buddy started using drugs, mixing bennies, reds and laxatives in dangerous quantities, no one was there to question him.

I can hear him speak thoughtful words.
 Fear v. Love
 While speeding on Interstate 5 north out of Sacramento past orchards and pastures, with long miles between the small towns, I think back to my talk with Toni, the part about suffering from panic attacks.
 During five of those hard years, while I taught in Chico, I often drove this highway to visit writer friends in San Francisco.
 This part of I-5 terrified me, with visions of a sudden attack that would deny me control over my mind or body, leaving me helpless and miles from the closest nurse or doctor.
 For no good reason except the fear of fear, my heart would race, my lungs and throat constrict, my hands become slick with sweat.
 I couldn’t run because I couldn’t breathe.
 I couldn't fight, because the enemy was me.
 The first time, a few years before, I landed at County Mental Health in San Diego.
 A doctor prescribed valium, which barely helped.

She returned his smile.
 "Some like garden parties and cotillions.
 I like speakeasies.
 And I want to go to Hollywood."
 He laughed.
 "Why?"
 "It's so romantic--the moving pictures and the lovers and all the excitement.
 Is Hollywood still like that?"
 "Well, there are still movies and lovers and excitement, but I wouldn't call it romantic."
 "Why not?"

 Liz – Maybe, she boasts that she could out drink an entire company of Marines.
 But I think she would have to cheat to do it.

 How do you cheat to in a drinking contest?
 Liz – If I told you that, then what edge would I have if we ever had a drinking contest?

With the two of them so much closer, I could feel their energy beating at Jasmin and me.
 It was all I could do now to remain motionless as they entered what even I knew was striking range of Jasmin.
 "Awfully exposed out here, aren't you, precious?"
 Vincent's voice was a low, unnatural thing, pitched so it was just barely audible for humans.
 Cassie's expression made my stomach tighten up and my gorge rise.
 It wasn't right for a girl to look at another girl like that.
 Like she couldn't wait to watch Vincent do all kinds of terrible things.
 "Payback sucks, doesn't it?"
 Jasmin's complete stillness was an eerie counterpoint to the waves of power still beating at me.
 I somehow knew she was just seconds away from springing when the sound of running footsteps caused all three to turn.

I could not get a next breath.
 I tried to pry his fingers from my neck but I couldn’t get my fingers between his to loosen his grip.
 I finally got one of my hands wrapped around one of his fingers, but it wasn’t enough to free myself.
 I believed it was going to be over soon and I was going to die.
 I could see him clearly now that my eyes had adjusted to the darkness, and he looked like a madman just inches from my face as he continued to push me up against the door.
 He didn’t mutter a word from his gritted teeth.
 I don’t even know if my feet were on the ground.
 I must have passed out because I don’t remember what happened next.
 I awoke in the entryway and he was gone.
 I rolled to my knees and I could hear the crackle of the puka shells beneath the weight of my body.

His assistant had been killed in the Master’s own room.
 Rodregas reasoned they would find the keep partially pillaged as well.
 He knew Captain Poir would probably do one of two things: either come after him immediately or head to the Celestial Path Guild Hall in the capital.
 If Captain Poir headed immediately for the Guild Hall to report the strange happening, it would give him more time to find a place to lie low.
 However, it would be better for him if Poir went looking for Rodregas himself instead, and spread his men all over trying to find him.
 There were only about twenty Ravenhurr guardsmen.
 If they were sent in every possible direction, especially in pairs, there was a good chance that he would come across no more than two of them at a time.
 If they were still confused about whether he was or was not Ravenhurr, he would have an excellent chance of overcoming them.
 On the other hand, if the forces of the guild came after him… The guardsmen of the Immortalist guild were known as the Immortal Guards and their reputation as the premier fighters of the realm was seldom questioned.
 If they found out what had happened at Raven Keep there was not much chance for Rodregas’ survival.

 "The box?"
 "Yes."
 "Don't you watch talkies on it?"
 "Well, sort of.

 Most programs are shorter--half an hour or an hour."
 He went to get the TV guide and found the listing for Saturday evening.
 A western had come on at 9:00.

It'd sounded like the perfect job for Mom, albeit a short term one.
 Now it was sounding like it'd been too good to be true.
 The move had been something I'd opposed and then ignored when my opposition hadn't made any difference.
 I didn't know anything about grown-up things like mortgages.
 I'd been too self-absorbed to learn.
 For the first time I felt guilty about making things harder for Mom.
 Surely there was something I could have done to help out, even considering the attacks.
 "They can't do that, can they?
 I mean, if they told you that you had the job they can't take it away, can they?"
 Mom rooted around in a half empty box until she found some tissues, it wasn't the first one she'd been through this afternoon.

I mean, you had it before, it was there in humans, back and back.
 Listen to “Sing Sing Sing” and see if it doesn’t get inside you.
 Then, what rock did, after Rickie and Buddy and those guys, rock got a conscience.
 Partly Dylan’s doing, but it was inevitable, it was headed that way, the power of it, the communicative power.
 Man, I sound like Rolling Stone.
 What I mean is that rock wouldn’t have held it’s place if it hadn’t shifted, if the words didn’t start to mean something.
 It was time.
 It was time for music to mean something.
 Dylan, The Beatles, they led the way.

I tried to make him feel safe.
 “You know, I could protect you.” He was incredulous.
 I decided to show him.
 I stepped forward, noting his unease at my movement, and faced the boar that lay on the ground behind him.
 He turned to see what I was focusing on.
 I was afraid to scare him too much, so I decided on a small gesture.
 I held my hand out in front of me, emphasizing the action as I twisted my wrist in the air, the boar’s head spinning, the sound of its neck cracking in tandem with my movement.
 He gasped and stepped back from me.
 I was afraid for a moment I’d shown him too much.
 He looked at my face, searching, and finally let out a breathless, “Magic.” His face was filled with wonder.

But there was a hardness there, a doubting that made him wonder just how much of him she truly knew.
 “Tell me of the first time,” she said.
 He shook his head.
 “Not today.

 They both stood, Aurelia stepping away while Harruq stretched and popped his back.
 “Goodbye Harruq,” she said.
 The elf was almost past the trees when he spoke.
 “Hey, Aurelia?”
 “Yes, Harruq?” she said, turning to face him.

His face and armor were camouflaged with greens and browns, but just grass would make it difficult to go unnoticed.
 Still, he had no choice but to try.
 He tucked his bow beneath him and then smashed his face into the dirt while sprinkling grass atop his head.
 He shifted his legs back and forth until as much grass sprang up around them as possible.
 He covered the rest of his body in his cloak.
 A few words of magic shifted its colors, better emulating the nearby terrain.
 He tucked his arms underneath him, closed his eyes, and waited for his fate.
 For the longest of time, silence.
 His shoulder pounded with each heartbeat; his chest screamed with each breath.
 Colors swam across his eyes.

Maybe he'd just lost control of himself.
 Was that a patch of marigolds?
 She didn't remember any marigolds in the garden.
 She must have been strolling around the garden for at least an hour, and it was so foggy .
 .
 .
 could she have wandered into the neighbors' garden by mistake?
 She retraced her steps, but everything looked even less familiar than the marigolds.
 She knew there were no white roses in their garden.
 She was sure that the house was in this direction.

“The one time my car broke down in an inconvenient place, a guy stopped to help me, and he happened to be the handsomest man I ever saw.
 Maybe he was an angel.
 I don’t know.
 But it sure was fun breaking down.”
 With the time Olga didn’t spend laboring for the sake of acquiring stuff or treating herself to luxuries, along with writing and prayer, she attended gatherings of all kinds where she could meet folks who needed her to teach, or console, or pray with them.
 She chose to live much like Jesus, who passed through the world keeping a lookout for people he could help.
 The Secret
 I could use Olga’s comment that a family or business person might need a bigger house to justify my bigger house.
 I have a daughter and a business, the college.
 Or two businesses.

I hadn't even made it through the reading assignment, and I still got a perfect score on the pop quiz.
 Physics was surprisingly full.
 Apparently Alec was the only hard-core party animal in the class.
 I was still feeling weird from Britney's story, so unlike the rest of my classmates, who seemed genuinely intrigued by the assignment, I just pretended to leaf through a reference book all hour.
 Spanish was as bad as history.
 Mrs. Tiggs turned on one of the Spanish TV channels within thirty seconds of class starting.
 Towards the end of the hour I finally started to come back out of my funk, so I put the last few minutes to good use reviewing vocabulary for the quiz on Tuesday.
 I felt a momentary surge of relief when class ended, but the feeling evaporated when I remembered I had to go to math tutoring.
 I grabbed my math book, and met an equally morose Britney at her locker.
 There are only so many times one person can say something sucks, and expect the other person to agree with them.

"Me telling you the answers won't help you on the test.
 If you have a specific question about how to work a problem I'd be more than happy to help you, but I'm not going to do your homework for you."
 Britney looked like she had all kinds of things that she'd like to say, but she showed more restraint that I'd realized she was capable of, and kept them all inside.
 "Please explain this one then."
 I ran through three different examples of the same problem before she got it, but thirty minutes later she was finally working on her homework for the first time I'd ever seen.
 I was surprised just how satisfying it was.
 Maybe I should become a teacher.
 Rachel caught my eye before I made it back to my table.
 She gave me another tentative smile as I slid into the seat next to her.
 "I'm really sorry about yesterday.

Her staff shot spun back and forth to parry thrust after thrust.
 Harruq pressed his attack, shifting on one foot so that his next two attacks came slashing downward for her thigh and ankle.
 The staff blocked one but the other banged against her calf.
 “One to two,” Harruq said.
 He double thrust, offering the elf no reprieve.
 She jabbed her staff upward, pushing the two attacks high and giving her room underneath.
 Ducking forward, she tried to strike the half-orc’s leg.
 She badly underestimated Harruq’s new speed though, and one blade looped around to block the attack.
 The other went straight down, the edge smashing hard against the top of Aurelia’s skull.
 While it did not draw blood, the jolt of it knocked the elf to one knee and gave her a dull ache in her head.

“Have fun finding that forest slut,” she said before walking on.
 Harruq shrugged, deciding his ability to pick kindly people wasn’t very impressive.
 He tried again, this time with a tired man trudging down the street.
 “Never heard of her,” the man said.
 A few more unsuccessful attempts sent Harruq away from Singhelm and further into Celed.
 There the reception toward him took a significant turn for the worse.
 Many refused to meet his eye or acknowledge his question.
 The half-orc’s frustration grew.
 “That’s it,” he muttered to himself.
 “Just one more and I’m going home.

“Well, up to me then.” He took out Condemnation, grinning as the soft red glow lit up his face.
 “Let’s see how strong this girl is.”
 He swung the blade.
 Qurrah closed his eyes and hoped no significant enchantments guarded the fence.
 If any did, they fizzled against the magic of the ancient sword.
 Harruq sliced two of the bars cleanly, and a third dented in enough so that a follow up chop cut it like butter.
 Pleased, Harruq took two of the bars into his hands.
 His neck bulged, his arm muscles tensed, and then the iron screeched backward.
 Both winced at the noise.
 They did not move for the next five minutes.

For this competition each squire was allowed a servant to provide support, mostly assistance with equipment, especially fresh lances.
 “Where is everyone?” he asked Doi’van.
 Doi’van did not look up from the ground where he was trying to straighten out a shield without doing more damage and said, “I wondered that myself.
 Apparently most drop out by this point.
 A lot have been injured, especially during yesterday’s sword and shield competition, and many simply quit due to not having any points yet.
 If you are going into the most dangerous part of the competition to be injured or killed and you have only one or two points, why bother?” Doi’van said.
 “To be honest, I am surprised how many are left.
 There are still quite a few young fools out there.” “So how many are left now?” Rodregas asked.
 “Fifty-four, on my last count,” Doi’van said.
 Rodregas was a little worried about his shield and wondered if he should jump in and rescue it from the powerful grip of the Hellborn, but he held his tongue and let Doi’van handle the equipment.

“What I don’t get,” Jason said, “is how the arrow managed to stay in perfect shape when the ground collapsed.
 The arrow should be broken and not sticking out of the ground a few feet away.” “Maybe she shot it after,” Emily suggested, because that meant that she was alive.
 Jason rubbed his eyes.
 “I guess that’s a possibility.
 Jazell and Seth were always too stubborn to die anyway.” He stopped pacing.
 “But why would she shoot it up here?” “Maybe she wanted to show us that she was alive,” Emily said.
 “A sign,” Jason muttered and snapped his fingers.
 “That’s it!
 Jazell likes to leave clues, check the arrow.” Emily turned the arrow and saw a sloppy line drawn through two squiggly circles.
 She squinted closer and saw that Jazell had tried to make the line some sort of sword but epically failed.

Not only was I devastated, I was a sucker and a fool to have helped him.
 After all of the agony during detox, he was back on this shit and nothing had changed.
 My love for him and our effort and commitment to him as his parents wasn’t as strong as his desire to ingest Oxy.
 Brandon’s addiction to this drug was more powerful than anything I could offer and all the love Lisa and I could show.
 My wife woke to my screaming and she was as shocked as I was when I showed her the test results.
 Brandon had to want to get better.
 As he packed his meager belongings, I grabbed the hand held video player and replayed the footage I had taped of him detoxing.
 He begged me to stop the video as he could hear himself on it screaming in agony as his body craved this drug.
 Brandon was crying uncontrollably as he tried to look away from the video that I continued to shove in front of his face.
 Lisa stood there pale and exhausted, frightened like the night of his intervention.

I was still reeling in surprise as we walked out to the parking lot and met up with the rest of the pack, or rather the rest of the pack minus Alec.
 He'd shown up several minutes later, looking very satisfied with himself, but obviously unwilling to answer any questions.
 As we caravanned home, I realized the collection of vehicles carrying us back to Alec's estate probably cost more than my house.
 Donovan had met us at the door and conducted us to the dining room, where Alec and his friends devoured a sizable meal.
 Even back when I'd had a more substantial appetite, I still couldn't have kept up with the wolves.
 Even the girls packed away more food than I would've believed possible for such slender frames.
 I mentally shrugged and added it to the list of shape shifter benefits.
 Able to eat like a complete pig and still slip into size zero jeans.
 Dominic spent a couple hours after dinner helping me with Spanish.
 She probably would've spent even longer with me, but Mom called, so Dominic slipped out to give me some privacy.

Rodregas was used to sparring with Doi’van and was surprised when his opponent went flying into the line of contestants and did not get back up.
 Rodregas waited a moment and then looked at the knight who stood outside the match.
 The knight did not look as surprised at the quickness of the match as Rodregas.
 He simply nodded toward Rodregas.
 Rodregas left the square and the knight sent the next two in.
 By mid morning Rodregas had cleared out his square without major effort.
 He noticed that all the other squares were still going on.
 His matches had ended faster than the others.
 His body’s balance of strength and speed were at full advantage in hand-to-hand fighting.
 He fought three others at the end of the afternoon; all three had won their group of matches.

Rodregas looked into Imeralda’s eyes.
 She had been watching him.
 There was no need for words, no argument.
 The decision was made, they only need direction.
 Any hope for success laid in playing to their strength.
 Rodregas said, ”Doi’van, you stay here and use the bow.
 You start from the middle of the caravan as soon as you feel comfortable, and focus on the slavers.
 If you get a free shot at an Immortal Guard, take it, but we need to reduce the numbers against us.” “Imeralda, you need to stay away from the close-in fighting.
 Get as far back as you can and still be able to see and shoot into the road.
 You will focus on the front of the caravan and also focus on the regular slavers.

Later, when I met him, I talked to him about this and he was, well, flattered, I guess, and he talked about how Guthrie and Leadbelly were like that for him.
 All these memories collide in my head to form a capharnaum around what I want to know more concretely: how did Bob Dylan become important to me?
 And the process must have been gradual, an accretion, Bob Dylan never became, for me, what James Joyce was for Richard Ellmann, or to use a less pretentious comparison, what hamburgers were for Wimpy.
 A centering object, a holy thing.
 But he became a dream-figure, a part of my unconscious, as I understand the term.
 Is Bob Dylan more than a man?
 Is he more than a man with an extraordinary gift?
 Is he really something holy?
 Of course not.
 He is just an exceptional artist, a poet, a singer of peculiar power and persuasion and grace.

At the same time, this incredible advance has been accompanied by events that have destabilized the political and economic systems of the entire region, led to the break-up of the USSR, war in Bosnia, the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the COMECON trade system, a massive brain drain and the threat of huge waves of economic refugees.
 These changes, too, have had implications for all nations within the region and beyond – severely affecting trade around the world, from the tea estates of Sri Lanka and India to the wheat fields of the United States, Australia and Argentina.
 So, too, the further course of this transition will have a profound impact on all nations, both developed and developing.
 The future of world peace, the world political system and the world economy hang in the balance.
 A successful rapid transition will open up new markets to stimulate a new round of growth for the sluggish economies of the West, much as the Mar shall Plan stimulated American prosperity in the 1950s.
 It will equally present economic opportunities for developing countries unable as yet to meet the quality requirements of highly competitive Western markets.
 Failure of the transition holds the danger of economic collapse and political instability within Eastern Europe, which could even lead to renewed political tensions and an other economically devastating arms race.
 Already ongoing wars are being fought in the Balkans, the Caucasus and several other regions of the former Soviet Union.
 Crime is on the rise.
 Ominous signs have appeared that the authoritarian past is not yet fully buried and could once again arise, if the forward momentum of the transition process does not quickly improve the lives of people within the region.

Her body was everything that he had thought it would be, both wonderfully hard and lush.
 To say she was the most beautiful woman he had ever enjoyed touching was a ridiculous understatement.
 Imeralda reached up to his neck and pulled herself up on top of his lap.
 She wrapped her legs around him and hoisted herself up like she was climbing the trunk of a tree.
 He had wanted to take his time and explore her with his hands and lips, but clearly she was in no mood for foreplay.
 Rodregas in turn was in no mood to stop her now that his own passion was building, and there was no reason to think that they would not be repeating this experience.
 There would be other times to explore her.
 Now was time to give in to their most primal needs.
 For one last moment he held her back, slowing her movements.
 He was a little worried that she would have trouble handling his size, but she literally started bouncing on his lap and his own groans joined hers and he stopped thinking and gave himself to the pleasure of the moment.

I wanna talk about that.
 I mean, I love performing, but I also gotta spend time just playing for me, just me and the guitar, so I learn the message, so I understand.
 CM:  	Let’s backtrack a little.
 I wanna talk about “Turntable Poison,” in particular some of the things that have been written about it.
 Some analysts of the record see things in it, which I’ve heard you deny, yet, there does seem to be something underneath the surface of these songs, something darker.
 Dave Marsh described it as “Mansonish deviltry mixed with Buffalo Springfield lyrics and Cream jams.”  It’s this Charlie Manson element that I’d like to hear you talk about, this school of thought that the record is some sort of coded message, a hint of what was to come, a gateway to the Apocalypse, according to Crawdaddy.
 BG:  	Is that a question?
 CM:  	It’s a whole area of question.
 It’s a school of thought—surely you’ve heard or read some of this.
 But I’ve never heard you talk about it.

 "No," she replied, intrigued.
 "What is it?"
 "It's like ice cream but better for you.

They did not move for the next five minutes.
 When both felt comfortable, Harruq shoved the third bar forward, giving them a nice clean entrance.
 The two brothers slipped under, the bigger half-orc having to press his arms together to squeeze through.
 They slunk across the lawn to the front door.
 “Hold,” Qurrah said softly.
 “I will take care of this.”
 Qurrah stood erect, his hands touching the sturdy oak.
 Words of magic slipped from his lips.
 The shadows that weaved about the door suddenly gained life, crawling and gliding until impenetrable darkness covered every bit of oak.
 “What’d that do?” Harruq asked.

 Qurrah crossed his arms.
 “Who is he?”

While our warriors are not as renown as some of the other races, we have several who are worthy of such armor and such gear is critical for our own survival.” Imeralda could see both men’s renewed rage at Jordaan’s words.
 She knew she should calm them down, but her first thought was how stupid men could be, men of all races.
 Sure it would have been great for them to get their better quality armor, but they were only alive because of her.
 She was the one who had to come back and shoot the final guards.
 She was the one who had to come back.
 She shot the final guards with the Black Yew bows.
 She was no warrior but had gone back with only a few arrows and rescued them.
 She had patched them up, rounded up the rescued slaves and sought a refuge.
 “Are you insane?” she asked them in a voice that was as cold as her anger.
 Imeralda, her voice dripping scorn, added, “It was only because one of the slaves had family at the local village that we were able to find this refuge.

 When he raised his head, she whimpered, wanting his mouth on hers again.
 But she gasped with pleasure as he began nibbling on her earlobe.

 He'd never held a woman so eager, so responsive to his slightest touch.
 But he had to stop.
 He had to stop now.
 He raised his head, straightening and pulling away.
 But Marie clung to him, rubbing her face against his neck.
 "Kiss me again, please," she murmured, raising her head to press her lips to his.

“No jest,” the guard said.
 “You two are leaving this city, now.”
 “My things,” Harruq said, his voice coming out as a weak croak.
 “I don’t see anything,” said the guard, scooping down and retrieving the scattered coins Harruq had dropped.
 “In the shed,” Qurrah said.
 “That where you two live?”
 “Yes.”
 “Fine,” the leader said.
 “Go and get whatever the abyss you can carry.”
 Harruq climbed into the shed, throwing Qurrah a worried look before he did.

It was a thin glass heart set inside a slightly larger heart.
 "I saw it when I was in Virginia last week for business and thought of you."
 "It's beautiful.
 You shouldn't have, but thank you."
 Alec slipped it around my neck and did the clasp, his fingers lingering a fraction of an inch from my skin but he pulled them back without ever actually touching me.
 It really was beautiful; I looked back up to thank him again when a wave of weakness slid through me.
 Alec caught me before I hit the ground.
 "Are you ok?"
 "I think so.
 I thought I was past all of this recovery stuff."

Henry Swift and his best friend Bingo, who lands in a nursing home after a car wreck.
 He can’t speak or do much of anything except wheel his chair in widening circles.
 Whenever Henry encounters a crisis or challenge, he goes to Bingo and bares his soul but never gets an answer.
 Maybe on account of being an only child, ever since I can remember, I have longed for a best friend to whom I could tell all the crazy stuff I think and feel.
 A best friend is what I hoped Karen Flagstad could be.
 I used to think, with someone who could know my secrets and also douse the fire in me and thereby keep me from all the nonsense men do on account of women, I could live content and free.
 I won’t argue the chicken and egg question, does our desire for intimacy rise out of our need for God, or is our belief in God the desperate attempt to satisfy that inborn desire for intimacy.
 But I’m placing my bets on the former, the need for God answer.
 Which is why, on this road trip, I find myself hopeful to the point of desperation that, taking a cue from Brother Lawrence, I can learn to adore God enough so that he will become my daily companion, whom I count on and trust with my failings and secrets.
 Suddenly, maybe invited by all the remembering, a whole other wave of thought takes hold of me.

 It wasn't the best lunch he could offer a guest from the 1920s, but it was the only thing he could think of to prepare in the microwave.

"I predict our house is soon going to be full of all kinds of knickknacks and gadgets."
 Smiling, she pulled him closer for another kiss.
 He was constantly thinking of her, buying her gifts and designing adventures for her.
 Sighing, she leaned into him as their kiss went on.
 Rick was lost.
 She held nothing back in her kiss, making him hungrier for more.
 He pinned her to the car, pressing his body full length against hers.
 Marie gasped, her fingernails digging into his shoulders.

 “Hey Aurry, I got something for you!”
 Harruq tramped into the clearing, his two swords sheathed.
 Aurelia waited there, her arms crossed.
 “A present from a half-orc,” she said.
 “Should I be worried?”
 “Nope.
 Just take it.” He held out a small brown box.

We hid our bikes in the trees and snuck up to their backyard.
 Jason and Seth appeared to be setting up some airplane that they built from scratch.
 They were muttering to each other and assembling a table they would use for a launch pad.
 I grabbed my water gun and Emily took out her trebuchet, with her balloons, and we snuck up on them.
 I held my hand up to stop Emily, waiting until Jason and Seth were grabbing the airplane out of a box and lowered my hand.
 “Revenge!” I yelled, and ran out from behind the trees, with Emily following.
 The looks on their faces were priceless.
 They spun around just in time as Emily launched a balloon right at Jason’s face.
 I aimed at Seth, who I soaked in minutes.
 Their faces looked like they had seen a dinosaur come back to life.

They looked defeated and unhealthy as the officers who escorted them cuffed each one to a chain that ran beneath the benches as they awaited their hearings or sentencing.
 I imagined my son in their place.
 I wished my son was here to see what could have been.
 The audience in the courtroom was a colorful mixture of society’s misfits and their families.
 Again I found myself hoping nobody would recognize me or my son’s name plastered for all to see on the hearings notice sheet attached to the courtroom door.
 These fatherly duties seemed minimal after what I had already done and I was happy to do this because he was getting the help he needed.
 I was still humiliated to be there and to see my last name on the court docket clipboard.
 Easter weekend, Lisa, Bryce and I drove over eight hours drive towards Temecula, California, then over a rural road through a desert valley to Werner Springs.
 There was no mistaking our destination when we spotted it.
 It looked like the recreation yard in the film One Flew Over the Coo Coo’s Nest, as people milled about, stopping and turning to look at us as we entered the parking lot.

Liz – Of course, I was sooooo jealous, my parents haven’t ever done that sort of thing for me…
 Jim - Well the party was paid for out of Johnny’s college savings account.
 He kind of made a nuisance of himself to get a party, so she made him spend his money to pay for it.
 Liz – That must have cost a fortune, did he have to pay for the gifts too?
 They must have cost $1000 alone.
 Jim – No, other people bought some of those…
 Liz – well that’s not so bad as I thought…
 Jim – She took the ones that we bought him back to the stores, and the rest she gave to the rest of it all to the Salvation Army.
 She told him “those things were too good for someone as worthless as him.”  He must have cried for a month afterwards.
 That was just one event.

 She laid her head on his shoulder again.

 CHAPTER EIGHT
 "How does the airplane get in the air?"
 They were on the plane waiting for takeoff.
 Marie was in a window seat, squeezing Rick's hand as she looked out the window.
 "The plane goes really fast down the runway until the air lifts it."
 "It's so big and has all these people in it.

If he didn't know better, he'd swear she was the most cunning seductress he'd ever known.
 Her innocence combined with her confession was a powerful aphrodisiac.
 She was so trusting and yet so passionate, her mouth as hungry as his, her hands caressing and clutching and clawing at his chest and shoulders and neck.
 Hadn't she understood a word he'd said?
 Rick let the embrace go on for as long as he could.
 Then he ended it abruptly, setting her on the sofa and holding himself away from her.
 "Rick," she gasped, reaching for him.
 "No.
 No, no, no," he groaned, refusing to let her put her arms around him or kiss him.
 "I want more, Rick.

A hint of motion told me that wasn't going to be the case.
 The passenger side window was sliding down with the smooth, even motion of power windows.
 "I've heard that some of you easterners have some really funny ideas.
 I guess seeing as how we don't have any mass transit out here you must've decided you needed to walk home.
 Don't you think it's a bit hot for that kind of environmental responsibility?"
 The voice was familiar, but my mind initially refused to place it with a face.
 It was too unbelievable to be real.
 I took a couple more steps, and then looked to my left and was rewarded as an infectious grin slowly appeared on Brandon's face.
 I wanted to say something witty, but the thoughts all just swirled around in my head without making it down to my mouth.
 Brandon's smile grew just a little bigger.

 She blushed.
 "Oh, we stare.”  He grinned, but then his face grew sober; being able to see from her perspective made him realize that, as much as he enjoyed looking at women on the beach, the changes in modesty reflected a decay in morals that would probably make her uncomfortable.
 "Morals are one of the things that have changed a lot in the last 84 years.

 “What did you learn this time?” Dieredon asked as Aurelia arrived at their designated spot in the forest.
 “Something is wrong,” she told him.
 “He’s kind-hearted, even goofy.
 He takes to his swordcraft with almost perfectionist precision.
 Everything else he does is for fun or survival.” Aurelia sighed and rubbed her hands across her face.
 “It could all be an act,” Dieredon ventured.
 “Or just a side of his personality.

Doi’van and Rodregas had to manhandle the wagon around a few corners which was easier to do than it should have been, but Celestial and Hellborn strength together made short work of it.
 Then, as they finally started to level out into the small little valley of the hollow, the hair all over Rodregas’ body suddenly stood up on end and his skin shivered.
 Rodregas was expecting it, but was a little shocked by the strength of his reaction.
 All those years ago he had had to struggle to feel it.
 Now he almost swayed in the currents of the magic stream of energy.
 The wagon halted as Doi’van stopped pushing it up the incline.
 He just stood there, his wild black unkempt hair seeming to blow in an invisible wind.
 Imeralda looked equally surprised and caught up.
 That was interesting.
 Clearly Imeralda would have the power to sense the stream of magic, but Doi’van had seemed equally effected.

 He quickly loaded the dishwasher, poured in the soap, and turned it on.

The airy, sunlit room we walked into was almost like being outside.
 There were a number of plants scattered about the space, some resting on the floor, others on a variety of slender stands.
 The effect was ethereal.
 It was hard to imagine that any of the spun-metal stands could support anything more substantial than a box of Kleenex.
 It wasn't until we were further inside that I realized there was an entire alcove off to one side, almost completely dominated by a black grand piano.
 The piano was so breathtaking it was several seconds before I realized there was someone sitting at it.
 "Alec.
 I'm so glad you're safe.
 Rachel was going on and on about some kind of problem with the pack.
 She's so excitable.

Our teammates were mostly the older sons of squatter families whose homes, made of scraps of tin, wood, and cardboard, balanced on narrow ridges along the walls of the Cañon del Sol, which ran down off the mesa to the border.
 Eddie Carmichael and Kenny were swift outfielders who would later play college ball.
 Bob Simmons would one day pitch for the Minnesota Twins.
 I was a good hitter.
 We helped the team place first and get invited to the Primera Fuerza for the next round.
 Now our games were on Friday nights.
 Since Kenny’s mom didn’t care to deliver us for night games, and since we weren’t yet eighteen, she helped us secure border-crossing passes, which we liberally abused.
 Tijuana was wild and ugly.
 We saw fevered children out in the cold, begging on street-corners after midnight.
 I tripped over a dead fellow.

Role of Government
 Agricultural subsidies and protection are subsets of a larger issue – the role of government in agricultural development.
 The experience of the past four decades strongly supports the view that government can play a vital role in stimulating agriculture up to the stage where the rural economy demonstrates the dynamism needed to take off on its own.
 Although the Green Revolution has been widely heralded as an achievement of modern technology, the hybrid seeds and chemical-based cultivation practices that formed the technological basis for the breakthrough in foodgrain production constitute only one part of a comprehensive, integrated development strategy in which government played a central and crucial role.
 This strategy included massive, country-wide demonstration programmes to introduce farmers to new technology, the establishment of new public sector agencies for rapid multiplication and distribution of seeds, assured markets and guaranteed floor prices for foodgrains to eliminate fear that higher production would result in crashing prices, construction of additional storage capacity to house the increased production, import or manufacture of fertilizers, and, most importantly, for transport, distribution and marketing of surplus grains in food deficit areas.
 Few developing countries – perhaps few countries at any stage of development – could have marshalled resources on such a massive scale and instituted such widespread changes so rapidly without heavy reliance on the government for both planning and execution.
 In the majority of developing countries, government is still the most organized and efficient agency and the only one capable of such significant initiative.
 In formulating strategies, it is essential to take fully into account both the stages and steps of the development process.
 At this stage in their development, it is highly unlikely that food-deficit African nations can make rapid progress toward food self-sufficiency without strong government support and investment to improve technology, training, techno-infrastructure and trade.
 Once the rural sector begins to exhibit its own dynamism, as in the majority of developing countries, there is strong justification for a shift in the role of government from that of prime mover, planner and controller of development to that of catalyst and pioneer.

6.Government regulation is essential for a free market: A free market does not mean an unregulated one.
 Quite understandably, decades of totalitarian government had generated such powerful resentment against strong government that by way of re action the society sought for solutions which did not require government to take a highly visible, leading role.
 The reform programme was based on the implicit assumption that the market is a self-regulating mechanism which can substitute for regulation by government.
 This notion is contradicted by the experience and practice of every major market economy in the world.
 Government plays a critically important role in defining and protecting property rights, ensuring competitive conditions, controlling monopolies, regulating foreign trade, establishing and enforcing quality standards, safeguarding the rights of investors and consumers, preserving the environment from over-exploitation and pollution, encouraging investment, and upholding the rights of employees to minimum wages, safe working conditions and social security in the case of lay-offs.
 The policies that have made possible the most successful recent development initiatives of nations around the world, especially in Japan and the newly industrialized nations of the Pacific Rim, do not support the argument for unregulated free market forces.
 These countries combined freedom for entrepreneurial initiative, private property and market prices with care fully crafted industrial policies and tightly controlled foreign trade and investment practices to nurture and protect nascent industries and restrict foreign investment.
 At the same time, they organized the importation of foreign technology on a massive scale.
 They utilized import tariffs, export incentives, tax relief and other mechanisms to guide development of their domestic economies.
 The reform programme involved the dismantling of most of the administrative mechanisms by which an economy can be monitored and controlled by government.

He glanced back at Aurelia and held back a curse.
 “Weapons,” he said again, his voice an angry whisper.
 “Nothing more.”
 “If that is your belief,” Qurrah said, settling down upon the grass.
 “But don’t forget the blood on your hands.
 You killed more than I, brother.
 Now leave me be.
 The night has been long, and I need to rest.”
 Harruq let Qurrah sleep in the flattened grass by the fireside.
 As for him, he sat between Aurelia and Qurrah, glancing back and forth between the two.

I pressed a hand to my temple, reciting, “Elfreda Georgiana Suzetta Glaforia.” They all drew in a deep breath.
 “What?” Chevelle’s sigh seemed to have let the air out of him.
 His fingers rested on the edge of the cloak beneath me.
 “Are you in pain?” “No.
 Not anymore.” He nodded.
 “What do you remember?” “I was—” I faltered.
 I didn’t know why, but I felt protective of this secret.
 I didn’t want to tell anyone I was in my horse’s mind.
 I started again, aware of my annoyed tone.
 “I don’t know.

“What?” Rodregas exclaimed.
 “You don’t see that door?” Doi’van and he shared a look of confusion.
 The three walked back to the door that Doi’van had found, and could clearly see.
 Rodregas waited as Doi’van touched the handle but stopped him before he opened it.
 “Do you see anything?” he asked.
 Imeralda eyes opened wide when Doi’van fully opened the doors and revealed the room.
 It was in style identical to the first room of the Celestial Beasts except instead of great beasts on pedestals, it held crouching daemons in pits.
 The previous vague smell of brimstone and hellfire wafted fully into the room.
 Doi’van and Rodregas stepped into the room but paused when Imeralda did not follow.
 He looked back and she looked confused, squinting as if the room was not fully illuminated by the glowing daemons in their pits.

If a shouting match could be conducted in whispers, it was being done by Jasmin and James, neither of who looked like they were happy about whatever was being discussed.
 Alec wasn't talking, but from the way he was scanning the room, he didn't want to be there anymore than the rest of them.
 I made it to Brandon's table, and was still pulling my meal replacement drink out of my bag when the loudspeaker clicked on with the obligatory burst of static.
 "This is Principal Gossil and I've got an exciting announcement.
 The school is sponsoring a trip to Las Vegas to see the production of Les Misérables that just started.
 Tickets are available at a discounted rate in the office for the next two days."
 It was like someone had rifled through my mind to pick out my biggest disappointment in recent days, pulled it out and rubbed salt on the wound before cramming it back inside me.
 Of course I'd go see how big of a discount the school had gotten the tickets at, but it was extremely unlikely my tiny check would end up being enough.
 It took me a moment to realize Mr. Gossil hadn't ended his announcement.
 "...those wishing to be entered into the drawing should stop by the office between today and noon tomorrow."

The footsteps neared.
 A clacking sound haunted his hearing.
 It rattled sporadically, and it was most certainly bone hitting bone.
 He imagined a loose jaw hanging by only one side, or perhaps a hand held by a thread of flesh banging against a rotted femur.
 It took all his will not to scream when a great weight pressed against his shoulder.
 The pain that exploded throughout his body was so great he blacked out as he lay there in the grass, a horde of undead searching for his wounded form.

Closer links should be established between research and development teams in the military and civilian sectors at the national level.
 7.A greater degree of regional cooperation is desirable between states which share natural resources and common environmental interests.
 This is of particular importance where regional peace and stability is at stake, as in the Middle East, over the question of access to water supplies.
 Where national environmental resources may lead to dispute and conflict, agreements should be drawn up between potential belligerents and the good offices of the UN's specialized agencies used to anticipate and avert future conflict.
 Peace and democracy can provide only the foundation for stable and productive social life, not its fulfilment.
 For that, political security has to be complemented by economic security and a blossoming of individual and cultural potentials.
 Yet here our optimism seems to flag.
 Our thoughts of the new millennium do evoke images of greater peace and stability internationally, more individual freedom and democratic rights, growing international co-operation, exciting new technologies, increasing cultural interaction.
 But they also evoke images of more people and less work – meaning fewer jobs!
 No sooner has the threat of nuclear annihilation receded, than the spectre of chronic unemployment and unrelenting poverty has risen to replace it, giving renewed justification to humanity’s deepest anxieties by transferring them to a new source of apprehension.

“And he doesn’t know how badly.”
 One by one, the skulls’ fire went out and they fell like morbid hail upon the city.
 “Limitless,” Qurrah said, his smile trembling.
 Blood ran from his nose, and his skin was so pale Harruq could see his veins.
 “The well is limitless.”
 His eyes rolled into his head.
 Without another word, he collapsed.
 He dreamt of fire poured into flesh and a man whose eyes were glass.

He finally shrugged and wrote his name on the scroll in front of him.
 Rodregas’ heart froze as the sorcerer stood and strode over to the table.
 He reached out and casually touched the shoulder of the Knight Captain.
 “Captain Intreg, do you mind asking a few questions to confirm his status?” The Knight seemed uncomfortable under the hand of the sorcerer but nodded and said to Rodregas, “What is the eighth law of Chivalry?” “Thou shalt never offer combat to someone who is not equal in strength, unless in defense of the honor of the Order, for Justice for the oppressed or in defense of the weak,” he answered.
 Captain Intreg nodded and then asked, “A question of law: two messenger couriers stop at a keep with priority messages and switch out horses.
 The local lord finds that both horses are lame and are no longer any good.
 One of the messengers is from a neighboring lord and one from the Guild of the Celestial Path.
 What rights does the lord have in this situation?” Rodregas noticed the sorcerer seemed to stiffen at the question.
 Rodregas’ mind swirled.
 The first questions had been easy, but it had been a very long time since he had studied law.

And she'd even admitted that she enjoyed it!
 How could she have acted that way?
 Rick set the pizza on the table and picked up some change to go get them some Cokes.
 He knew Marie would be embarrassed.
 Women of 1927 weren't supposed to be so forward with a man, even if they weren't, as she was, engaged to another.
 But her kiss and the way she'd touched him made him think that maybe he could win her love.
 Maybe he could convince her to stay in 2011 with him.
 He returned to the room with the Cokes and opened the box.
 "Mmm—it smells great."
 He put a slice on a plate and handed it to her.

 Lying in the grass next to Velixar was the dead body of an elf male.
 Qurrah glanced at it, and then looked to his master.

 “Of course not.
 Both of you must rest.

 The elves are more than wary of my presence now.

I have loved my wife and I have shown my children that I love them.
 The boys have witnessed firsthand what a healthy spousal relationship is and that was something I never saw in my childhood home.
 I always believed in teaching my children to respect all people in all walks of life.
 On the holidays I sent my boys out to give freshly baked cookies to the people who collected our garbage.
 I taught the boys how to care for our yard, mowing and edging, and they had household responsibilities and chores (and I never sprayed them with a hose nozzle, at least not to compel yard work).
 I believed they needed to learn good strong work ethics.
 But I never once hit them, and I never abused them, as I had learned “what not to do” as a father.
 I did everything I could think of to give them the best chance to succeed in life.
 I protected them from what I felt were bad influences, including, sadly, my brother, their Uncle Thomas, who had not been reformed in prison.
 He was an addict into horse racing.

She still didn't look very happy, but there was a trace more self-control to her face than a few minutes before.
 "Britney, despite spending at least an hour at the tutor lab each afternoon, the quality of your homework hasn't come up in the slightest, so I took the liberty of talking to your father yesterday."
 Britney's gasp had all the dramatic effect you'd expect out of someone who'd spent the last decade of her life getting away with pretty much whatever she wanted.
 She was obviously pretending to be sorry, all the while figuring her current trouble would blow over quickly enough if she just played her cards right.
 "Your father agrees with me that your studies should be your highest priority, so you'll be staying an extra hour starting today, and ending once your performance improves.
 Of course you can always continue to just waste your study time, but if you choose to do that I've been assured that additional penalties will follow quite rapidly starting with the loss of your car."
 The next gasp was less impressive, but tangibly more genuine.
 Even my being next couldn't stop a flash of satisfaction at the way Britney was finally having to face some of the consequences of her actions.
 Mrs. Campbell dismissed her with a wave, waiting until she'd left, shutting the door with a tad more force than strictly necessary.
 "While I can't for a moment understand why you've chosen to befriend Britney, I can't fault you on your willingness to help her despite her flaws."

"Home?
 We've only been to two shops."
 "I'm a little tired.
 I'd just like to go home."
 She felt a little anxious as she walked into her house.
 She wanted Rick to hold her, to caress her hair and kiss her temple and whisper that he loved her.
 But she'd never have that again.
 When she'd chosen to return home, she'd given him up forever.
 She managed to hold herself together until she was in her room.
 Then she burst into tears.

On the battle field such reflexes means life and death.” Rodregas nodded, his words held the ring of truth, but he was not looking forward to days of practices and days full of bruises.
 The pattern of their days changed.
 Now after prayer and meditation came first the practice of the Kata, and then the staff and then finally the books.
 The true change came in the evening, the nights were full of such pleasure and joy such as Rodregas had seldom known in his life.
 The rest of summer passed as the most joyful that he had known, as the three started to the Kata and the staff.
 After the staff they moved to the bow where Imeralda became the master.
 To use the magical Black Yew bows required learning a spell to merging with the bow.
 The spell was unlike anything Rodregas had learned.
 Imeralda said it was seldom taught to non-nymphs, though Ravenhurr had known the spell and taught a few of the guards with a touch of the talent.
 Using the bows was a matter of sending your innate power into the wood and singing with it.

All the annoying riddles but that's the way it's supposed to be.” Then the voice said stronger, “Look behind you.” I turned back around to see the inside of the cave.
 A girl was walking towards me, the same one I saw last time.
 She didn’t like it because I was staring at her, but I couldn't help it.
 She stopped in front of me.
 “You're not supposed to see me yet,” she said and sighed.
 “Oh well, I never was one to follow the rules.” “Who are you?” She shook her head.
 “I can't tell you yet.
 That's one rule I'm not going to break.” I opened my mouth but she shook her head.
 “Don't ask what my name is or why I'm talking to you, because I can't answer either of those questions.” “What can you tell me then?” “I can tell you that I'm not an enemy,” she said.
 “I can also tell you to be careful about Kojas; he's tricky and will use your emotions against you.

Is she okay?"
 The sub had finally pushed his way through the crowd, and looked like he was about two steps away from a total panic.
 Alec stood, and it wasn't until I went up at the same time that I realized he was carrying me.
 "I think she'll be fine, but maybe I should get her to the nurse.
 Just to be sure."
 Even as he was talking, Alec was moving towards the door.
 "There's really no need.
 I'm fine.
 I don't need to see the nurse."
 It was obvious he was going to ignore me.

He looked angry.
 Like maybe he was going to argue, but as he opened his mouth Rachel turned and glared at him.
 It seemed odd to see someone only a little smaller than Alec back away from someone even smaller than me.
 The image stuck with me so strongly that I considered it until Rachel came over and took my hand.
 "What's wrong?
 It's just the two of us now, you don't have to worry about James, and I won't tell anyone else.
 I swear."
 Rachel's promise somehow seemed like it belonged from another time.
 The sincerity pulled me further out of my safe, numb shelter.
 Something in me wanted to confide in her, was willing to risk the pain of facing reality, but I was too far gone to be able to put what I was feeling into words.

It took him a long time before he remembered the battle.
 With the memory came concern for Doi’van and Imeralda, and a surge of adrenaline that gave him the energy to try to wake up.
 Rodregas tried to sit up, but his body, which had been so strong since that day at Raven Keep, now only responded sluggishly.
 He was sleepy, but had the idea that he had been sleeping a very long time.
 Yet, his body still felt exhausted.
 Rodregas must have moved enough to get some attention because a man, or to be more accurate, an adult male Nymph, moved into his sight.
 Rodregas was always surprised by the amount of hair coming out of the ears of an adult Nymph.
 He was glad that was one trait that Imeralda did not seem to have.
 He knew the thought to be a silly one even as it crossed his mind.
 It was quickly replaced with concern.

Brandon shook his head and flashed another of his winning smiles, albeit one with an overtone of sympathy.
 "I'm sure it isn't as bad as that."
 I wanted to disagree, to go into detail about why my life had just taken a turn for the worse, but something about his manner was suddenly distant.
 I thought about calling him out on it, but with my life suddenly looking like I was all but friendless, that didn't seem like such a good idea.
 Without really meaning to I'd managed to alienate just about everyone at school.
 Brandon already had plenty of reasons not to be with me, it was the height of stupidity to give him any more.
 I could probably deal with not having a boyfriend, even assuming that was what we were right now.
 Going half a year without anyone to talk to because my mom was wrapped up with her art and everyone else in the town thought I was stuck-up would be more than I could take.
 The thought was enough to leave me speechless for the entire drive home.
 Brandon seemed content to leave me alone with my thoughts as he sped around the various turns at speeds that normally would've made me protest.

Nevertheless, death…‌death has a way of teaching us things.

 I need it.
 You must give it to me.”
 Harruq crossed his arms and stared into the corner.
 “People die every day here,” he said.
 “Shall I find their bodies and bring them to you?”
 “For now,” Qurrah said.
 “Yes.
 If the death is fresh, the power should still linger.”

Between 1960 and 1992, total employment in OECD countries rose by 110 million jobs or 44 per cent, including a 22 per cent increase in the participation of women in the workforce.
 During this same period, un employment rose by 23 million persons, representing a 259 per cent increase in the overall unemployment rate.
 More people are working than ever before, yet at the same time more people are unemployed, because a larger proportion of the population seek jobs.
 Growing anxiety about employment prospects in the West were aggravated by a sudden 50 per cent increase in unemployment after 1990, which displaced an additional 10 million workers in the OECD and was equalled only by the previous high of 1983.
 This increase is now showing signs of reversal.
 These average figures disguise significant differences in performance of countries within the OECD.
 Since 1950, Japan’s employment rate has risen from 43 per cent to around 50 per cent, while unemployment has remained in the 1 to 3 per cent range.
 The overall proportion of the population employed in the European Community has declined by 1 per cent since 1965 and is presently just under 41 per cent, but the percentage of the working age population employed has remained more or less constant over the past three decades, at 67 per cent, whereas in other OECD regions it has risen significantly – to exceed 75 per cent in North America, Scandinavia and Japan.
 Europe’s lower labour participation rate is attributable to a number of factors.
 A far higher percentage of the European workforce was engaged in agriculture 25 years ago and has since shifted to non-agricultural sectors, an adjustment that occurred in the United States during earlier decades.

I threw a wary glance over my shoulder, making sure Ruby was still at the window as I continued.
 The days we had spent coupling had done nothing to diminish his desire.
 If anything, they had enflamed it.
 And his obsession with marriage increased tenfold.
 I had not met his family, but one morning when I arrived at the patch of forest where we met, he proudly presented his mother’s wedding gown, a gift for me.
 He wanted me to wear it in our ceremony.
 I had never agreed to the union, but I avoided telling him it was not possible.
 It would be only valid in his mind.
 But then again, what would that hurt?
 I accepted the dress from him, looking it over.

Of course, drugs were part of the scene then.
 They were everywhere.
 In the back of every minibus, in the bathroom of every nightclub, at practice sessions, in the homes of every groupie.
 And Buddy had his groupies.
 The twins used to joke that Buddy played for scrimption and blow jobs.
 This has some truth to it—the money wasn’t great in those days, asking for more money seen as bourgeois or worse—but the women were wonderful.
 Buddy, though, let it be said, played for one pure reason in those halcyon days.
 He played for the rush, for the approach to the godhead.
 It was religion to Buddy.
 He sought the perfect note, the one that would bring about rapture.

“When can’t you use sarcasm?” I asked loudly.
 He didn’t reply to me because he had spotted Emily.
 She was slowly backing up with her palms out.
 Fire danced from her fingertips and twisted towards the troll and frost beast.
 The beast breathed and ice sprayed from its mouth.
 Emily moved her hand over and the ice evaporated into mist.
 She was holding up fine but I didn’t know how much longer.
 I strung my bow and released an arrow.
 It pierced the frost beast’s pelt and it fell to the ground.
 Emily turned to me with huge, confused eyes.

"Could we go there sometime?
 You and I?"
 He smiled down at her.
 "An island cruise would be much nicer, I'm sure.
 In fact, I think it would make a lovely honeymoon trip."
 If her heart did one more somersault today, it was going to fall right into her stomach.
 Marie and Davis spent the next day with her family, and he promised to take her out for dinner and dancing again next Saturday.
 She suspected that he might propose soon.
 "What do you think about a September wedding, Mother?"
 Marie asked as they had lunch alone together Friday.

My heart tripped at the sound of cracking tinder beneath boot across the clearing.
 The fire had burned out, but the ashes were plenty evidence I’d been here.
 I ducked under the cover of a large spruce and watched.
 Chevelle walked through the tree line and my jaw clenched tight against a silent curse.
 He was alone.
 He kept walking as he looked my direction, surveying the damage from the fire.
 I was convinced he would know it had been me, but he didn’t stop or even slow.
 It made no sense.
 Why hadn’t he investigated further?
 Was he not here looking for me?

Rodregas simply flourished his short swords and smiled and stated, “Let’s just say that it should be interesting.” The Hellborn nodded very thoughtfully at Rodregas reply.
 The half AElf had followed the conversation between them with obvious interest, and quickly followed Doi’van’s’ lead in swearing the oath to the All-Father.
 But with the two of them the oath seemed different, more easily said and with no need for threats.
 Rodregas was not sure why, but he decided it was something to think about when he had more time.
 The rest of the night passed quickly as Rodregas did his best to bandage his stomach wound.
 He did not think the knife had cut into anything too important; at least it was not bleeding too badly.
 He was surprised that he was not more tired; maybe his new body handled such things better and could make do with less sleep.
 He was usually a light sleeper and was very surprised that they had been able to get the drop on him.
 His guess was that the AElf maiden had cast some sort of spell on him to mask their approach, and he kept a close eye on her to make sure she did not repeat the effort.
 Of course she was also very nice to look at, so he did not need much of an excuse to enjoy the view.

“And why not?”
 He picked at some grass and said nothing.
 “Well?” she asked.
 “Well what?” He looked up, his face blank and his eyes wide as if he hadn’t a clue.
 “Why am I not a lady?” Aurelia asked.
 “I don’t know,” Harruq said.
 “Did you cast a spell on yourself or something?
 Look like one to me.”
 She stood and took up her staff.
 Instead of grabbing his swords, Harruq ducked behind a tree.

Tears streamed down my face and my body began to release from the dead weight.
 Chevelle had saved me from my mother’s fate.
 How long had he been my watcher?
 In the memory, he’d fought to keep me from seeing, tried to cover my eyes.
 And later, he’d pulled me from the water, dragged me away as we fled.
 I shook with sobs and a pair of arms wrapped around me, supporting me as my limbs became heavy, my body and mind spent from the stress or whatever trauma the spell had caused.
 I couldn’t say which, because I was pulled from consciousness into a black, dreamless sleep.
 Chevelle was still holding me when I woke in the late morning.
 I wondered if he’d slept at all.
 Cradled in his arms, I reached up to rub my bleary eyes.

In our more enlightened age, however, the only acceptable basis for a nation’s sovereignty is that it expresses the will of its own people, and this condition can only be met under a freely chosen form of government that enables people to express their own free will and determine their own destiny.
 Therefore, the decision of the UN to insist on the operation of democratic processes in member countries is an essential step toward resolving the dilemma of sovereignty.
 When the representative nature of a national government is in question, its claim to sovereignty over its own people under all circumstances is also questionable.
 Hitherto, it has not been possible to address this issue forth rightly, because the evolution of the international community had not yet come to accept in practice, as opposed to merely in principle, the fundamental human rights so frequently espoused in constitutions and ignored in actions.
 This situation has changed, especially after humanity’s bitter experiments with totalitarian regimes during this century.
 It is now recognized that the democratic principles of political freedom, social equality, self-determination and related human rights are inalienable and must be extended to all people everywhere.
 The second factor that naturally imposes limits on national sovereignty – the rights of other nations and their citizens – has also gained substantially wider acceptance, has been enshrined by international law, and has become accepted doctrine governing many facets of international relations.
 Common security against transnational threats and common prosperity for all humankind cannot be based on a 250-year-old concept of nation sovereignty.
 Over the last half century, national sovereignty has been maturing into international sovereignty.
 As the evolution of the international community proceeds towards the establishment of an effective system of world governance in one form or another, the collective rights of the international community of nations must inevitably come to be regarded as another inalienable truth, alongside individual human rights and the rights of each nation.

She gave half to Ashhur and half to Karak.
 The souls of the soldiers who fought and died alongside them were given to their masters.
 She cursed the elves who sided with Karak, branding them the ‘orcs,’ or ‘betrayers’ in her tongue.
 Once the brother gods were locked away from the world, and each other, Celestia issued her final decree.”
 “What was it?” asked Qurrah after Velixar remained quiet for a moment.
 “She ordered that Ashhur and Karak continue the fight they refused to end for all eternity.
 Many centuries have passed, Qurrah.
 I am the hilt of Karak’s sword, the greatest priest in the war against Ashhur, and I have not relinquished my position.”
 The man’s eyes grew so bright that the half-orc felt the urge to grovel.
 “Ashhur himself killed me.

They'd nearly triggered a full-scale blowup.
 Mom thought I just wanted new clothes.
 I knew we couldn't afford a new wardrobe just because I was temporarily skinny.
 I didn't mind wearing my old stuff, I just didn't want to wear Cin...wear her clothes.
 My near attack ended the conversation, albeit with my old clothes still packed away in some anonymous box.
 Mom's enthusiasm couldn't be damped for long though.
 It had fully returned by the time she turned my light off.
 "Have a good night, Adri...ana.
 You'll see, tomorrow will be like the start of a whole new life."
 I kept the tears back until the door was shut, and then they came in a hot rush that left me depleted and sore.

“Dress,” the necromancer ordered.
 Ahrqur growled some inane argument, but a glare from Velixar sent him cowering.
 “You must obey my every command, wretch, before you may return to the peaceful death you left.
 Fight me and you shall find your stay here lasting longer than your rotting body’s.”
 The undead Ahrqur whimpered.
 Qurrah watched the display, fighting against feelings of jealousy.
 He had commanded Ahrqur’s spirit to speak truthfully, but Velixar’s very glare sent him groveling to his knees.
 The elf stood and dressed, covering his white form in the red and black garb.
 Once dressed, Harruq gave him the ornate elven blade.
 “Your quest is a simple one,” he told his slave.

I opened my eyes and looked over to where I just had been or still was.
 My human body slightly glowed as it sat in meditation under the tree.
 It didn’t move.
 I could see the monster clearly now that I had stepped into its world.
 It was hunched over, occasionally touching the ground with one of its curled front paws.
 Dark saliva dripped out of its mouth.
 The beady black eyes made it no less scary.
 I knew exactly what it is.
 A thrasher!
 A shiver ran down my spine.

 But what did Kojas do?
 He whipped out his sword and slashed the arrow in half right before it hit him.

“Shouldn’t have left you alone,” he said quietly.
 There was a tinkling laugh in the front room and I groaned.
 She was here, too.
 The water helped.
 I was able to sit up with Chevelle’s assistance.
 Ruby swirled into the room, dressed in a red frock of sorts.
 The color hurt my eyes.
 “Here, a bath will help.
 Come with me, dear.” Her hair was tied halfway back with a scarf, the tattered ends mingling with crimson curls.
 I felt dizzy again.

"Sorry, I just don't like to see that kind of needless destruction.
 It makes everyone look bad and costs the town a lot of money."
 Brandon's smile was back, but it didn't have his trademark easy carelessness.
 "Now you sound like my mom."
 We rounded a corner before Brandon could say anything else and nearly ran into Britney.
 "Guys!
 Did you see the back door?"
 I could almost see the wheels turning in Britney's head.
 First she went red as she remembered she'd stranded me at school, then her eyes got a little wider as she realized it was still about five minutes too early for me to have arrived on the bus.
 Brandon's normal smile was back.

“Were they hurt?” “No.
 And our thanks to you for that as well.” I wasn’t exactly sure how that was due to me, but I smiled, glad they had found them and everyone was safe.
 They turned to leave and Grey entered with two spits of meat and wine.
 It almost seemed like a celebration.
 Almost.
 Their high spirits hadn’t quite returned from before.
 I wondered how long I had been out.
 I wondered where the councilmen who’d attacked us were now.
 The wine flowed.
 Steed took some food to Anvil, Grey and Ruby made their way to the front window, and I found myself sitting alone with Chevelle.

Rumors at the time suggested that her husband had transmitted a venereal disease to her."
 Rick was shocked.
 He had a hard time picturing the young woman in the picture as a victim.
 Of course, even today women stayed with men who abused them, and it would have been much harder for a woman in the 1920s to escape.
 But why had she married him?
 Had she not seen what type of man he was?
 He turned back to the picture.
 The article had said that she’d been vibrant and fun-loving in her youth, and he could see those qualities in her eyes.
 He would have liked to have known her.
 Well, before her marriage, anyway.

“Shall I find their bodies and bring them to you?”
 “For now,” Qurrah said.
 “Yes.
 If the death is fresh, the power should still linger.”
 Harruq reached out, grabbed his brother’s wrist, and clasped his hands in his.
 “I won’t like it,” he said.
 “But I’ll do it for you.”
 “We are better than them,” Qurrah said, standing so he could look through the cracks of the boards across the broken door.
 “Stronger.
 Life is for those who take it.

It was hard to believe this was the same person I'd had to rescue from Cassie so recently.
 I stopped Rachel just before she could put the impressive lungful of air she'd just taken in to whatever use she'd planned.
 "It's okay.
 I'm better.
 The lane's dusty and exercise would do me good."
 She hesitated, obviously torn, but my fumbling fingers finally found the unfamiliar door release and I made the decision for her.
 I swung the door open and slipped out of the car before she could respond.
 I waved goodbye with a cheery casualness I thought did a pretty good job of hiding my desire to break into tears.
 It was amazing how I'd let the numbness slip away for nothing.
 Rachel wasn't any more my friend than she'd been a few minutes before.

They passed closed homes containing people praying for safety and victory.
 Looming ahead of them was the southern gate.
 Hundreds of soldiers stacked against it, their shields braced and ready.
 All along the walls, archers released arrow after arrow into the darkness.
 “How are we to get closer?” Qurrah asked.
 “Ignore them,” Harruq said.
 “I know what I’m doing.”
 He led them into an alley in between several worn buildings made of stone.
 He stopped just before the next set of homes, for he heard talking.
 Holding Qurrah back, he peered around the corner to find a soldier dressed in finely polished armor raising his sword in salute.

The half- orc gripped Condemnation in both hands, snarling as the elf launched his own offensive series.
 The elven blade glided through the air, repeatedly feinting and looping wide so that Harruq’s sword danced about for phantom blows.
 Ahrqur let out a mocking laugh, gave him an obvious feint, and then kicked high.
 The foot smashed the bottom of Harruq’s chin, the same sore part Dieredon had hit.
 Harruq staggered back, his sword swinging wildly.
 The elf charged in, knowing he outmatched the half-orc in speed and skill.
 The kill would be his.
 “ _Hemorrhage._ ”
 A sudden purging of blood vessels exploded across Ahrqur’s side.
 The force smashed him into a decorative table.

It isn’t real?” He let out a harsh laugh and I jerked back.
 “Oh, I suppose it’s real.
 The service is real.
 Honestly, Freya, don’t you see?” “See what?” I cursed my bound brain.
 “Grand Council.” I drew a sharp breath at the words.
 “The calling is simply service to Grand Council.
 A hundred years of servitude under the guise of duty and honor.
 What is honorable about doing their bidding?” “So you don’t… answer the call?” I stumbled, searching for words.
 His laughter was a roar.

I had gone in through the servants’ quarters, desiring to keep a low profile.
 When they saw me, fear crossed their faces and they disappeared from sight.
 My heart sped.
 I wondered if something had gone wrong with Rune’s spell this time.
 I decided to go check on him.
 I realized I was running.
 As I rounded a corner heading to the practice rooms, I ran into something hard.
 The impact didn’t knock me down, but the shock almost did.
 It was one of Father’s guards… one of the guards he’d taken with him.
 He had me by the arm, dragging me along before I could think.

Even back then, before she reached forty, she wore nothing belted, only shapeless dresses and muumuus.
 She charged around the house with steps so tiny you might wonder if her feet had once gotten bound.
 A unique mother, or at least the opposite of most, she treated her son with great respect and the rest of us with very little.
 She didn’t baby Eric.
 Rather, from all I saw, he might’ve been the only human she considered her equal.
 But I rarely saw her with people.
 Now and then I would find her on the porch with a neighbor, gossiping about a different neighbor, but the only ones who got inside her dark little house were Eric and his friends, and Richard.
 He was a jazz pianist about ten years younger than Sylvia, and half a head shorter than either Eric or she.
 Just as Sylvia’s bluster made people wrongly suppose she was a drunk, Richard’s stupefied expression made me suspect he was a junkie.
 Sylvia had a piano, the only treasure in a living room full of hand-me-down furniture.

But at the same time they stimulate growth of employment in many different ways – increasing demand for the products thus manufactured by a factor of 10, 100 or even 1000 fold as in the case of automobiles, TVs, cell phones and computers; increasing the demand for research workers to support technological innovation and for teachers to meet the rising demand for education; and rising living standards, which increases consumption of other goods and services due to the falling prices made possible by rising productivity.
 Over the past two decades the US economy lost nearly 4 million manufacturing jobs but added a net 37 million jobs through expansion of the service sector, which now accounts for 84 per cent of total employment.
 It is time that we stop resisting or resenting this trend, but rather strive to adapt by shifting our focus toward those fields of employment which are most directly stimulated by technological innovation.
 Export of commercial services already accounts for 20 per cent of world trade.
 The shift from manufacturing to services is a positive and inevitable expression of the elevation of human activity from the physical to the mental level, which is the central reason for the phenomenal rise in global living standards over the past century.
 Rich nations have become rich through a shift of workers from the primary farm sector to value-added, non-farm secondary and tertiary sectors.
 Poverty and hunger persist so long as a majority of the population depend upon the routine operations of farming for their livelihood.
 This is also the cause of the growing feminization of poverty in developing countries.
 Today’s developed nations arrived at their present position by a long, slow migration from agriculture to manufacturing to service sector, but that does not mean developing countries must follow the same path.
 The growing demand for services in the developed world coupled with rapid strides in telecommunications has created the possibility of skipping steps to abridge the development process.

Today, I was fully prepared to acknowledge Britney as the spoiled, self-centered brat she was.
 The bell rang and then Mrs. Campbell's lecture was over in record time.
 I even finished my assignment a good ten minutes before class was scheduled to end.
 I was absently sketching what I expected the inside of the opera house to look like, when a tap on my shoulder pulled me out of my reverie.
 "I'm so sorry, Mrs. Campbell.
 I finished early, but I should have started on one of the catch-up assignments.
 I just didn't want to get into a whole new subject with only ten minutes left."
 Her smile was much more understanding than normal for a classroom situation.
 It took the sting out of the words that were probably just for the people close enough to overhear.
 "Don't you worry, Miss Paige, I'll let you know when I don't think you're keeping up.

“Go now,” Velixar said.
 “The night is young.
 Hide his body in your home and bring it to me tomorrow.
 And Qurrah, remember to bring his blade with you.”
 The two brothers bowed and then left to do as their master commanded.

 [section break](break.png)
 Dieredon watched the brothers travel back to Woodhaven.
 He had been waiting outside the town, and in the starlight the swathe of darkness rolling across the land had caught his eye.
 He had followed and from a distance observed the short meeting.

Jim – He said the same thing,  at least after he figured out who I was.
 But then he told me that I was just about 20 credits from graduating, and at the end of this semester I would only need 8 more.
 Liz – Did he say anything else?
 Jim – He also asked why I had taken the Mayan art class, and a few others.
 I explained and in the end he seemed to have been happy to see me getting ready to leave.
 Liz – You’re impossible.
 Jim – Yep, and its hard work too.
 Speaking of art, when did you want to do my nude portrait?
 Liz – How about this weekend some time?
 Jim – Sounds good to me.

Like maybe he was going to argue, but as he opened his mouth Rachel turned and glared at him.
 It seemed odd to see someone only a little smaller than Alec back away from someone even smaller than me.
 The image stuck with me so strongly that I considered it until Rachel came over and took my hand.
 "What's wrong?
 It's just the two of us now, you don't have to worry about James, and I won't tell anyone else.
 I swear."
 Rachel's promise somehow seemed like it belonged from another time.
 The sincerity pulled me further out of my safe, numb shelter.
 Something in me wanted to confide in her, was willing to risk the pain of facing reality, but I was too far gone to be able to put what I was feeling into words.
 I shook my head again, not sure if it was a refusal or something else entirely.

“I won’t let you all pay for my crimes.” Confusion passed over their faces, everyone except for Chevelle.
 “We aren’t.
 You don’t understand…” Something flickered in his eyes.
 “Besides, they are pursuing me.
 For choking the tracker.” Grey shook his head.
 “Because of me,” I argued.
 “And now you’ve killed one.” But I didn’t know who had killed him.
 Anvil had stood before the man, but any one of them could have snapped his spine.
 “Frey.” Chevelle’s tone was solemn.
 “You know what they did to your mother.” And I could hear what he didn’t say.

"Why, hello, you must be Adriana.
 Can I call you Adri?"
 I shook my head.
 "I prefer my full name, Mr..." "Wilkenson, Mayor Wilkenson.
 Is your mother home?"
 Suddenly struck by the fact that living in the country meant there wasn't anyone around to hear your screams, I almost lied, but for whatever reason I believed him.
 Maybe because he exuded the false, overabundant sincerity I'd come to associate with both the class presidents I'd known back in Minnesota.
 "She's out photographing one of the parks.
 Is there a message you'd like me to pass on?"
 He looked surprisingly uncertain, almost like he was used to working from a script, and didn't know what to do when things didn't go as planned.

It felt good being there, surrounded by my new companions, a fire and stories, laughter.
 This was more of a home than Fannie’s had ever been.
 But I was also under the influence of a fairy.
 “Better yet?” Ruby asked.
 I grimaced.
 Grey approached.
 “Ruby dear, won’t you allow us to partake?” “Speak for yourself,” Anvil cracked from across the fire, “last time I lost a bit of tongue.” I cringed and remembered my dream.
 I thought I could still smell burning flesh.
 Ruby laughed.
 “Ah, well, I suppose just this once.” Grey sat, rough brown boots resting among the stone, and she leaned over him as if for a kiss.

"Come sit down for a minute and have a Coke."
 He managed to keep her still for less than five minutes.
 They danced almost non-stop for the next hour and a half, and then Rick declared he'd fall asleep behind the wheel if they didn't leave.
 Marie could have gone on, but about five minutes after getting in the car, she was yawning.
 Rick opened her hotel room door for her and gave her the key.
 "I'm not going to have them wake us up.
 Just come knock on my door whenever you get up."
 "OK."  She smiled up at him dreamily.
 "This evening has been like a fairy tale.
 Even if we left tomorrow, I'd be happy."

But by themselves these steps will only mitigate the most pernicious threats to international security.
 They will not provide an effective system for ensuring the peace and security of all nations that is so vitally needed, and now so imminently possible, as a basis for accelerating the political, economic and social development of humankind.
 The end of the Cold War provides us with the opportunity, and pressing global issues provide the urgency, for more significant measures.
 These measures cannot be conceived within the perspective of international security that has dominated our thinking in the post-war period, or from a half-hearted desire to modestly improve what to some still appears an adequate and acceptable system.
 This is an occasion that demands visionary and courageous leadership to usher in a better world.
 The children of the next millennium will judge us by our response.
 Historically, all landmark changes in the international political and security system have been the result of armed conflicts, wars and revolutions.
 In each case the victors who emerged from the ashes of war sought to build on a static formula for enforcing peace in a dynamic world.
 In each case, the arrangements for conflict termination contained a dynamism that would produce the tensions, disputes and conflicts of the future.
 These in-built limitations and imbalances resist adjustment until a new round of fighting sweeps away the old frame work and replaces it with another, fashioned in much the same way.

Both men glared at Harruq as he stood, but while their mouths moved and their chests heaved neither produced a sound.
 The half-orc looked to the woman shrouded in the shadows cast by the fallen torch of the patrolmen.
 “I said move along,” she said.
 “I need to give these men a talking to.”
 “I’m going,” Harruq grumbled before staggering down the alley.
 He did not attempt either stealth or silence.
 Seething, he limped back to Qurrah and their home.
 Neither said a word as he discarded his armor, tossed his swords into a corner, and crashed onto their bed of straw.
 For a long moment, only the sound of Harruq’s heavy breathing filled the room.
 “I assume things didn’t go well?” Qurrah finally asked.

 Perry was his name.
 Always calling me names, trying to make me lose my balance while lifting and carrying things.
 Then he did something stupid, Aurelia.
 He did that in front of Qurrah.”
 Harruq thrust out his chin and squinted.
 “This was how that Perry guy looked.

Now that I had a chance to talk, I wasn't sure what to say.
 Nobody had ever wanted to hire me.
 Mrs. Campbell gave me a tired smile.
 "The tutor lab is still understaffed.
 Obviously you couldn't spend your whole afternoon tutoring, as that would negatively affect your efforts to catch up.
 I'm thinking just an hour or so per night.
 It would just be minimum wage, but I think you'll find you quite enjoy teaching."
 Still at a loss for words, I just nodded.
 I started towards the door as soon as I was dismissed, but stopped at the threshold.

The memories of his family’s murder.
 My mind writhed with anguish through the night.
 As I emerged from the shelter late the next morning, I was resigned.
 I would continue my journey with him and let him return me to the council without resistance.
 It was all I could do.
 I found him sitting near the shelter’s entrance, distress apparent in his features.
 “Thank you,” I said, indicating the shelter.
 He nodded, but his face didn’t quite return to the serene mask he usually wore.
 My stomach knotted; I hadn’t eaten since our ride the day before.
 “I’ll get you some food,” he said.

He stroked her hair as he gazed down at her.
 "We were all out of our minds with terror and grief.
 None of us could just sit still.

 Somewhere along the way Father and I worked out our differences."
 "That's wonderful!
 I'm so glad."
 She slid her arm around John and smiled at her parents.
 "There's nothing that could make me happier than being with my whole family."

I suddenly had a hard time breathing.
 The idea of lying alone in the dark, in the very room I'd just seen Brandon demolish, sent my heart into an erratic rhythm.
 If there'd been an EMT present they'd have already been charging up the defibrillator.
 Alec turned around while I was still trying to get my throat to work again.
 "You stopped breathing.
 What's wrong?"
 The tears his touch had dried up a few seconds before were back, and just seconds away from escaping the corners of my eyes by the time I finally pulled myself up onto my knees and managed to speak.
 "Please don't send me there.
 Not after my dream."
 There was just enough moonlight trickling into the room for me to see his expression change.

Strangely enough that didn't bother me as much as I thought it would.
 It was like walking down the lane managed to put things back in perspective for me.
 How could I be put out about something I hadn't ever actually believed was possible?
 I almost refused to believe my eyes when I came around the bend in our lane and saw a black Mustang parked on the side of the road.
 Brandon stood up from where he'd been leaning against the sports car and flashed me a blinding smile.
 He moved towards me with a casual grace that made little shivers run through me despite my earlier decision not to let his interest, or lack thereof, affect me.
 "I had a bet with myself that you weren't going to wait.
 Somehow the fact I just lost doesn't matter now."
 It didn't seem possible he was talking to me, that anyone so gorgeous could mean something like that about me.
 I opened my mouth, maybe to laugh the comment off, or otherwise hedge my bets against the humiliation and inevitable mocking laughter.

Eugene and Johnny – Sucker!

 (leave the stage laughing)
 Jim – Did I miss something?
 Liz – Well yes and no.
 Jim – That was the dumbest practical joke I’ve ever seen.
 Liz – Another thing Johnny and Gene have been doing since summer ended.
 Stupid practical jokes.
 Jim – Gene promised Art he would stay out of trouble.
 Liz – Well he hasn’t gotten into trouble yet.

She actually sighed as she passed the cake.
 The urge to giggle was so strong I uncapped my water bottle and turned slightly to the side in an attempt to disguise my amusement.
 It was one of those moments I'd try to reconstruct in my head again and again.
 I think I must have heard the cash register till close, or maybe Britney said something.
 Whatever the reason, I took a step in her direction while still looking away, my bottle half raised, and ran into the biggest junior I'd ever seen.
 My clumsiness would've been embarrassing enough all by itself.
 Unfortunately my mostly-full bottle of water splashed all over both of us.
 I felt my cheeks go hot.
 Britney gasped and giggled.
 I silently told myself things were as bad as they were going to get.

It had been his only shot at survival, and the young man had already been dead in all ways that mattered, but still it was an act of incredible repugnance to him.
 He thought, “Once again I have done what I needed to survive.” As Rodregas lay on the floor he looked up at the stars and the looming figure of the captain.
 He had to think quickly.
 It was instant death for anyone to interfere with an Immortalist Ascension ceremony.
 It was the most stringent rule enforced by the Guild of the Celestial Path, and therefore the most enforced rule in the Eastern Realm.
 “Ah, thank you Captain, I am fine,” Rodregas said.
 He instantly realized the captain would know that all was not well.
 Rodregas felt exposed without his armor and said the first thing that came to mind.
 “Please, if you can get me my clothes.”  Rodregas waved over to where the sorcerers robe was folded on a small table next to the stairway.
 As he looked over, Rodregas saw that Junnit and Dale had re-bound the AElf maiden with iron and replaced her gag so that she could not use magic on them.

Nobody else has ever stood up for me like that.
 At least not people that I didn't already know."
 Based on what I'd seen less than thirty hours ago, it didn't look like her friends stood up for her either.
 "No worries, it just seemed like the thing to do at the time.
 Why did she want to hurt you anyways?"
 Rachel looked down, but somehow it wasn't a gesture that conveyed guilt.
 "It's complicated."
 I'd spent too much time with emotions and thoughts floating around in my own head that I didn't want examined too closely.
 I wasn't about to pry if there was something she didn't want to tell me.
 "I guess that's fair.

Aurelia giggled at Harruq’s squirming.
 “He’s a loveable puppy dog, but I do not think he is smitten.
 Are you, Harruq?”
 “Um, course not,” the half-orc said.
 Aurelia and Qurrah shared a quick, knowing smile.
 The frail half-orc’s face lost much of its lifelessness, and a gentle caring filled his eyes.
 His seriousness quickly buried it, but Aurelia had seen enough.
 “I shall leave you two to your studies and sparring,” Qurrah said after a long pause to torture Harruq.
 “Although I doubt the wisdom of leaving him alone with such a beautiful teacher.”
 “Good thing you will not have to worry about that, considering I see no beautiful teachers around,” Aurelia replied.

Everyone in the club was Italian, except one fellow.
 He had a Polish name.
 They all were sharp dressers.
 To them, my traveling wardrobe marked me as a hick and slob.
 So when I arrived in my jeans and flannel shirt at a party to which they hadn’t invited girls yet they still dressed in alligator shoes and polished chino slacks, at least a few of them took offense.
 The Polish fellow began goading me, first about my clothes, then about the beard I had grown, then about what losers were all us from California.
 I attempted patience, since I was their guest and because I remembered Tony’s stories that placed him in the low range of this crowd’s toughness.
 But at last I mouthed a comeback.
 The Polish fellow threw a punch that landed square on my jaw.
 I staggered.

As the cold of the stone chilled his back Rodregas thought about his promise to the Celestial Gods that if he were able to kill Ravenhurr and live, then his new duty would be to fight the Immortalists.
 When all and everyone else had failed him over the years, only his duty had kept Rodregas alive.
 He no longer knew what to do without it.
 His back straightened and he pulled away from the wall that he had slumped against.
 Rodregas lived instead of the man whose body he now lived in.
 He had seen the tragedy of gifted person after gifted person be torn asunder by the Immortalists.
 He hated the Immortalists for their casual destruction and use of people.
 Could he now live in one of these stolen bodies, unless he had a reason?
 The Immortalists and their Guild were evil and needed to be opposed.
 The gods had given him a new duty.

Laura's Birthday
 First period Monday, I got called to Mrs. Bole’s office.
 I knocked, stepped in, and found her slumped over her desk.
 Though she was big and hearty, today she looked undone, like a visitor to Auschwitz.
 “Sit down, Kenneth.” “What’d I do?” “It’s about Eric.” Studying her mournful eyes, I eased myself into the chair.
 “Yeah?” “They crashed.” My heart stopped and I gave up breathing.
 “Eric?” I gasped.
 "El Cajon Valley Hospital.
 They don’t believe he’ll make it.” My brain catapulted through space, into a black hole.
 There I remembered the night my mom checked into the hospital and the doctor said she was probably a goner.

(laughs)  When she did swallow my come, with a big smile on her face, I was amazed, you know?
 I was like zombied.
 I had no idea that boys and girls did such things.
 I immediately went home and wrote her a song.
 CM: 	You remember it?
 BG:  	Ha.
 Well, yeah, some of it.
 “Cathy took me/out of the cold/Cathy took me/she was so bold.”  (laughs)  Shit.
 Ok, it was awful, but what other tribute could I give to such a fine gift?
 I wonder where she is now.

The organization of crafts, commerce, armies, governments – constructed from a fabric of customs, rules, systems and laws – each made use of the material resources for greater productivity, power and achievement.
 At each stage of this evolution, society discovered the power of knowledge to increase further the productivity of the material, technological and organizational resources at its disposal.
 A knowledge of weather patterns boosted productivity in agriculture.
 A knowledge of astronomy enabled sea-worthy vessels to travel across the oceans to distant lands.
 This led to the invention of systematic education as a method to pass on acquired knowledge and skills to the next generation and thereby continuously increase them.
 The Ultimate Resource
 These rich and varied discoveries came as the result of a careful observation and analysis of the external world around us, an infinite exploration and experimentation with things, an endless trial and error blending of minerals and plants to forge metals and produce medicines.
 As a result, for millennia we have tended to overlook or, at best, grossly underestimate the greatest of all resources and the true source of all the discoveries, inventions, creativity and productive power found in nature – the resource that has made minerals into ships that sail the skies, fashioned grains of sand into tiny electronic brains, released the energy of the sun from the atom, modified the genetic code of plants to increase their vigour and productivity – the ultimate resource, the human being.
 World Food Prize recipient and father of India’s milk revolution, Dr V. Kurien, has decried the tendency to credit external factors for the accomplishment of people.
 ‘It is the farmer that has produced this miracle, not the cow.’ And so it can be said of the Industrial Revolution and the Green Revolution.

I planned on playing that card for all it was worth.
 I was staying and that was it.
 Alec sighed, presumably in resignation, and then suddenly my legs were thrown up in front of me as he picked me up with inhuman speed.
 Only the steady pressure of Alec's arm around my waist kept me from screaming, and then I was back on my feet, and being carefully, but firmly shoved through a tangled knot of bodies.
 My shoes had never been intended to allow ankles to withstand that kind of punishment.
 Even just walking had been risky, so it wasn't a surprise when my right foot slipped, and a sharp knife of pain shot through that ankle as it collapsed under me.
 Dealing with blinding agony hadn't ever been my strong point.
 I opened my mouth to scream, only to find that no sound would come out.
 The world was still spinning, but I was oriented just enough to realize that Dominic had her hand over my mouth and nose.
 I pulled at her arm, but the effort was completely futile.

 Liz – Or I’ll tell everyone I know that I’ve seen you naked.

“Will you if you must?”
 The half-orc did not answer.
 Qurrah stepped around and stared into his brother’s eyes.
 “If we meet her on the field of battle, if we fight her, she might attack me instead of you.
 Her or me, brother.
 Who would you choose?
 Which of us will die?”
 The burly half-orc buried his gaze into Qurrah’s eyes.
 He did not flinch, and he did not lie, when he spoke.
 “She would die.

Gene turned Conservative Christian, it was kind of scary for several months.
 After about three or four months of taking bible lessons they decided to baptize him.
 Art – Three months without offending the entire group and getting him-self kicked out?
 I am indeed impressed by Gene’s willpower, I didn’t know he even possessed that much.
 He didn’t last much longer did he?
 Jim – (shaking his head) No.
 At his baptism.
 Well I thought he was going through with it, he had me convinced.
 I thought he was for real and for true going to join that church.
 Art – That boy could make a fantastic actor one day.

I slid down, barely standing on my feet.
 Someone was in front of me.
 Ruby.
 I threw my hands back to steady myself.
 It felt like a wall of stones behind me.
 I didn’t look back, though, because just as I’d regained my footing, I heard the howls.
 Before the next breath, a new sound—a closer sound—filled my ears.
 Shoosh, shoosh, shoosh.
 It took longer than it should have to realize they were arrows.
 My mind couldn’t seem to process the scene fast enough.

It was oddly silent except for a pinging sound, as if someone was dropping pennies in a pan.
 It was the sound of the puka shells from the necklace I was wearing landing on the tile floor beneath me.
 Ping, ping, puh dit dit, ping.
 More of the shells fell and bounced along the tile.
 I could not get a next breath.
 I tried to pry his fingers from my neck but I couldn’t get my fingers between his to loosen his grip.
 I finally got one of my hands wrapped around one of his fingers, but it wasn’t enough to free myself.
 I believed it was going to be over soon and I was going to die.
 I could see him clearly now that my eyes had adjusted to the darkness, and he looked like a madman just inches from my face as he continued to push me up against the door.
 He didn’t mutter a word from his gritted teeth.

 "I have no idea."
 After listening to the water in the machine for a few moments, she turned to Rick with a shy smile.
 "Can we watch a picture?"
 "What kind of picture?"
 "What kind are playing?
 I like romances more than anything."

It's just more dominance games."
 I nodded.
 It made sense, but it was all I could do to keep my eyes grounded despite the cold prickles running up and down my spine.
 Actual conversation was just too much, so I sat quietly with my head slightly bowed while the song ran its course.
 Alec's fingers gently pulled my chin up as the music ended.
 "Dance with me?"
 I mustered a brave smile as I nodded and let him lead me out onto the dance floor.
 It was a slow song this time, and Alec didn't protest when I abandoned all pretense of actual dancing, and just leaned into him hungrily.
 The reassurance I was seeking was weaker than normal.
 The solid feel of his body was just as permanent as always, but there was no tingle where our skin touched.

Once you piss one of them off though, you'd better hope you're in with the other one, because that's the only way you've got any kind of protection."
 It was starting to sound like organized crime or something.
 Of course they could make my life miserable socially, but it wasn't like they were going to really hurt me.
 I opened my mouth to try and calm Britney down, but she cut me off.
 "You don't understand how much influence they have.
 Three years ago someone tried to start a newspaper in Sanctuary.
 Things were going along just fine until he pissed off Alec's mother.
 The city condemned the building and refused to change the zoning laws so he could get another place.
 When he really pushed the issue, his house mysteriously caught on fire."
 My mouth was hanging open, but Britney seemed to think it was disbelief rather than amazement.

More than two hundred moving forms halted after that one pass, but a thousand more swayed in their sick, distracting dance.
 “One free pass,” Velixar said, observing the flight of elves as they swarmed overhead.
 They banked around, still in perfect formation, and then dove again.
 “Kill them now!” he ordered, his fingers crooking into strange shapes.
 “ _Hemorrhage!_ ” Qurrah hissed, pointing at the nearest horse.
 Blood ruptured from the beautiful creature’s neck.
 The rider steadied her best he could, knowing his doom approached.
 They crashed into the inky blackness, crushing bodies underneath before the swarming dead tore them to pieces.
 Velixar’s first attack was far more impressive.
 Bits of bone ripped out from his undead army; femurs, fingers, ribs, and teeth flew into the sky in a deadly assault.

I never saw that chick again, I can tell you.
 I mean, I got out of there fast and tried to restabilize my pride, and I just thought, well, fuck it, I don’t know what that was all about, I don’t pretend to understand what that was all about.
 So, anyway, that inspired this song—actually, Lor and I talking about that incident inspired that song.
 The line “she was going through her midtown period/there was blood in the air” is mostly Lor’s.
 CM:  	That’s quite a story.
 Ok, that leaves “Goodbye to the Shell,” maybe one of your most controversial songs, one that some folks back in Memphis didn’t take too kindly to, one that is perhaps misunderstood.
 Can you clear it up any?

 It’s about leaving Memphis, yeah, so what?

Her pendant hung there.
 It started to refract light, but there was only darkness around my vision of her.
 The wind picked up and her dark hair began to whip back and away from her face.
 She was smiling, glorious now, her arms outstretched.
 The pendant started to glow and the darkness cracked.
 The wind was howling.
 I could barely see.
 Or maybe something was covering my face.
 When I screamed the sound was lost.
 I tried again, but suddenly I was mute.

It was killing him, boring him silly.
 But, he came home every night with a grin on his face.
 Ate dinner with us, spot on 4:45, like you could set your fucking watch by it, and then, evenings when he played, he’d sheepishly pick up his little case, which usually sat in the back closet next to his shoe tree, and he would toss off a sad smile and go play till God knows what hour.
 And Mom would sit and stew.
 That was her métier.
 Stewing.
 Sad stuff, really.

_You’re an orc, aren’t you?_
 “Yes,” he said at last.
 “I’ve killed.”
 He eyed Aurelia, desperately wishing to know what she thought yet unable to figure out why he even cared.
 He thought he saw pity in her eyes, perhaps compassion.
 But there was a hardness there, a doubting that made him wonder just how much of him she truly knew.
 “Tell me of the first time,” she said.
 He shook his head.
 “Not today.
 Maybe some other session, if I feel I can.”

Turning around to return to the tutor room, I almost tripped over my own feet when I saw Britney standing just outside the closed door.
 "Are you crazy?
 First you side with Rachel against Brandon, firmly putting yourself in Alec's camp, and then you turn around and piss off Alec?"
 I really wasn't in the mood to argue with Britney, so I tried for nonchalance.
 "So now I'm not on anyone's side.
 They'll both leave me alone and I'll be fine."
 "Oh, yeah, because that's how things work."
 I'd only thought Britney was mad before.
 She was all but shaking with fury now.

So much for that plan.
 “Emily!” I yelled but my voice was drowned out.
 I saw a flash of fire off to the side.
 Emily was fine.
 I twisted around so that the troll charged past me.
 I turned and plunged my knife into its back before it could respond and it fell to the ground.
 I felt pain flare in my right foot and looked down to see a frost beast with its teeth in my leg.
 When I tried to pull away, in bit down harder.
 “Ow,” I yelped.
 “Ow,ow,ow, get the heck off me!” I slashed downward and the frost beast let go of my leg.

Not singing out loud, but making the power vibrate and move in a rhythm that matched the wood.
 When that magical rhythm was reached, the bow suddenly became almost fluid and moved nearly of its own volition.
 The arrows flew with incredible force and accuracy.
 The only problem was that the three could not practice freely as the arrows sometimes shattered on impact, as they flew with such force.
 Doi’van quickly mastered the spell and the use of the bow.
 Rodregas, on the other hand, struggled to learn the artistry of the spell.
 One afternoon, a few days after Doi’van had mastered the spell, Rodregas stood there with the bow trying hard to both find the rhythm of the spell and shoot the weapon.
 Imeralda stood next to him, her hand lightly touching the bow as she tried to figure out why he was still struggling with the mastery of the weapon.
 Rodregas reached down into himself, to that place that held his magic.
 Though Rodregas had never had much power, he had always enjoyed using his “itch” (as he had always called it) to do small things.

Such a system necessarily demands massive investments by each country in military capabilities.
 These investments are inevitably perceived by other nations as real or potential threats to their own security, thus fuelling compensatory escalation of military capabilities by other states.
 Calls for disarmament alone cannot and will not eliminate the problem.
 They must be complemented by concrete measures to establish an alternative mechanism to ensure the security of nations.
 This is one of the major reasons why expectations of a massive peace dividend have not been fulfilled.
 World military spending has not declined significantly because the competitive security paradigm remains intact.
 Steps being taken by the members of the European Union to build a truly cooperative security system indicate the right direction for the world as a whole.
 It is no wonder that the first such initiative comes in Europe, which has been the leader of thought for the past 500 years – from the birth of modern science and parliamentary democracy to nationalism, socialism and universal education – and which has been working for the past five decades to evolve a viable working model of fully democratic, voluntary supra-nationalism.
 Democratization of the UN: The phenomenal advance of Europe’s multi-dimensional unification is a clear indication that in future international institutions will play a more important role than national governments.
 But this can happen only to the extent that these institutions are living proponents of democratic functioning and individual freedom.

CM:  	“The Ballad of Buddy and Lor” was released as a single but never appeared on an LP, am I right?
 BG: 	 Partly.
 It appeared on an Atlantic LP of uncollected gems, along with some of Felix Cavaliere’s solo stuff, an Aretha demo, stuff like that.
 CM:  	What was it called?
 BG:  	Uncollected Gems.
 CM:  	Worth seeking out, for collectors, for completists.
 BG:  	If you say so.
 My song was a gift to Atlantic because Ahmet and I were friends.
 Much of what’s on there was crap.
 CM:  	Yet, you never recorded on Atlantic.

Then, supposing I knew as much about love as I ever would, I turned to reading mystery novels, since writing them had become my occupation.
 The Truth
 I mean to be hard on myself and dedicate these pages to honesty, even if it gets brutal.
 My beloved grandmother, Mary Garfield, often assured me that a liar was the worst of all people.
 No doubt she recognized how liars teach us not to trust.
 I believe it was Sylvia Curtis, when Eric and I talked to her about Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, who convinced me that Holden Caulfield was right to pour most of his wrath on phonies.
 When Olga Savitsky and I considered founding a church, we agreed that above the entrance would hang a sign, “No bullshit allowed.” After all, God is a matter of life and death.
 In Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Robert Pirsig argues that being stuck is the best place for a mechanic (or a problem solver of any sort) to find himself.
 When we’re stuck, we come to the problem free from any preconceptions.
 I mean to test his argument, because I’m stuck on the word “adore.” Here’s how it happened: in the midst of a period of personal, family, and professional turmoil, I picked up The Practice of the Presence of God, by Brother Lawrence, and discovered that simply reading about this fellow from long ago delivers some peace.

He glanced down, uncomfortable and saddened that Aurelia refused to look him in the eye.
 “Velixar is not who you think he is.
 He isn’t _what_ you think he is.
 He tried to kill me, Harruq.
 He enjoyed every second we fought.
 I saw many of my friends die at his hand.
 Do you know why he helps you?
 Why he claims to train you?”
 She gave no pause, no chance for him to answer.
 This was good, for he didn’t want to.

Nor does it mean that governments should try to spend their way out of unemployment by creating artificial jobs for all who seek them.
 But the high current costs of the unemployed certainly suggest that there are more constructive ways to spend available resources to solve the problem.
 Instead, a commitment to self-employment should lead the government to reexamine and where necessary alter the nature of its priorities and policies and the structure of its economic system in order to make achievement of this goal possible.
 The magnitude of the task and the prescription may vary, but the goal and determination can be shared by all.
 Employment Strategies for the Industrial Nations
 In the industrial countries, the phenomena of jobless growth coupled with persistently high rates of youth unemployment and of chronic unemployment among the poorer sections will not be eradicated by even the most optimistic rates of economic expansion or mere incremental adjustments within the context of present attitudes and policies.
 Although the problem has been aggravated by a variety of short- and medium-term factors whose effects will gradually dissipate over time – defence cuts, recession, East European economic crisis, German reunification, etc.
 – the present job crisis among Western nations is largely structural in nature.
 Although conditions vary from country to country, the crisis impacts most heavily on the unskilled, young people, urban poor, ethnic minorities and older workers.
 Specific programmes to effect structural changes will have to be introduced in order to ensure a fair opportunity to all, especially minority youth, to lead economically active lives.

“Um...” I said.
 “Why would we hide anything from you two?” Emily put her hands on her hips.
 “I don't know, but you two are acting like you are hiding something.” She stopped and gave me a wicked smile.
 “Unless you two were not talking-” “God no, Emily!” I interrupted her.
 “No way, we were just trying to get away from you two because I just woke up and you guys are really loud first thing in the morning.” She sighed.
 “Fine, don't bite my head off Jazell, I was just asking a question.” Then she turned and disappeared back in the cave.
 Seth let out a huge breath.
 “Wow, I'm glad she left.
 I had the feeling that she knew we were hiding something.” He hunched over me.
 “Because we are.” “Do you think we should tell them about my vision?” I asked.

I want to kiss you again, but I'll behave."
 "You like the painting then?"
 I nodded, and then shivered.
 It's amazing how a near complete loss of physical control can burn through your energy reserves.
 Alec frowned.
 "I'm sorry.
 I forget sometimes how much easier it is for you and Rachel to catch a chill.
 Let's get you inside where it's a bit more temperate."
 It seemed like such a waste, leaving the grotto after all the work that'd been put into transforming it, but Alec waved away my protests.
 He easily cradled me in one arm, while carefully picking up my painting with his free hand.

My head spun.
 Ruby caught my arm to steady me.
 Her smile was strained as she handed me a drink of water.
 Chevelle was near the entrance of the stone room with Anvil and Grey.
 They appeared to be preparing to leave.
 “What’s going on?” I asked.
 “Nothing to worry about,” Ruby assured me.
 “Just a hunting trip.” I was still muddled, but I knew it wouldn’t take three of them to hunt.
 And then I remembered the bits of conversation I’d heard when I woke.
 “Someone’s missing?” I took stock.

No doubt he could have told me the theme wasn’t much different from my dream of going off with Karen to a secluded cabin, or from my quitting the baseball team so I could spend afternoons alone smashing golf balls.
 But Eric rarely gave answers to questions we could solve on our own.
 In that, he was like God, who perhaps respects us more than we deserve.
 In The Brothers Karamazov, Fyodor Dostoyevski gives a story of Jesus coming to earth during the Spanish inquisition.
 He only heals a few of the suffering crowd before soldiers arrest and deliver him to the Grand Inquisitor.
 That old fellow commences to tell him where he went wrong.
 Jesus, says this astute theologian, attempted to give people freedom, when most of them want nothing to do with freedom.
 Their cravings are for food and other comforts, for easy answers to questions no matter how complex or perplexing, and for entertainment, to relieve them of the need to think.
 Eric, like Jesus, loved people too much to usurp their freedom by giving them what their lesser natures wanted.

Jasmin completely ignored me as she climbed into the car; Isaac gave me a polite, if somewhat cool nod.
 The Hispanic girl gave me an honest-to-goodness smile as she slipped behind the steering wheel and started the engine.
 In what was one of the most thoughtful things that'd happened all night, she turned the heater on full as she pulled out of the driveway.
 The drive into town, and then back out to my house was quiet, but luckily didn't take as long as normal.
 Apparently her timidness stopped well short of observing the speed limit.
 Alec, Isaac, and Jasmin all jumped out of the car as soon as my house was in sight.
 The car was still doing at least twenty miles per hour when they bailed.
 They faded into the darkened landscape about the time we rolled to a stop.
 I went to open the door, but a delicate brown hand stopped me.
 "I'm sorry you've had such a rough night.

I think I smell something like rotten eggs, but I can’t see well enough to go in.
 And I don’t know why, but I really don’t want to go in.” Doi’van and Rodregas shared another look and then nodding, stepped out of the chamber.
 The three of them stood silent for a minute.
 Finally, Doi’van spoke, “Maybe you need a connection to see the doors and the room?
 All of us worship the Celestials and we were all drawn to their sigils, especially Rodregas.
 I was drawn to the door here, which makes sense.
 This room, like the Celestial Chamber, seems to have similar beasts of the Infernal realm.
 Rodregas was also drawn to a lesser extent, which might indicate that we were right about Ravenhurr experimenting with Infernal power.
 If Ravenhurr had already included its magic in his own, then Rodregas would have it now.
 Imeralda though has no connection to the Infernal Realms and therefore is blind to it.” The three nodded slowly, caught up in the mystery of the hidden chambers.

“You share a minor sigil very freely for being in the great Cathedral itself,” her voice was but a whisper, her eyes more curious then challenging.
 “They would likely die without our aid,” said Imeralda.
 Doi’van nodded next to her.
 Rodregas thought that Doi’van was strangely silent.
 He guessed that the Hellborn was afraid to speak, even in a whisper.
 His voice was like granite breaking and traveled.
 “So you risk your life to save strangers?” the female squire asked.
 Her voice actually sounded curious.
 Rodregas said, “Yes, we do.
 You seem like an honorable squire, would you also like a minor Sigil of Healing?” He thought she was going to laugh at his question at first, but then she simply whispered, “That simple?” “Almost.” Rodregas said.

Art – Oh, a lawyer to be.
 Both smart and pretty.
 My name is Art by the way, Arthur Trelain.
 Karen – Pleased to meet you Arthur.
 If you don’t mind, why do you feel that you won’t be a good tour guide?
 Art – Well aside from the most important fact that I know next to nothing about art, I also tend to ramble on in strange directions when I make speeches.
 And unless you want to here me go off about how the tiles on the floor clash with the paintings, well you may just wish for better company.
 Karen – I don’t mind the rambling, at least if you let me get a word in edgewise to stop you.
 Art – Well, I’ll try.
 Where shall we start?

In contrast, the market is based on millions of decisions taken every day by millions of individuals in fields, factories and retail stores around the country.
 All these decision makers require timely access to re liable sources of information.
 Information is needed to make sound business decisions, such as the production of or demand for different commodities or variations in price by region or over time.
 Easy access, maximum dissemination, full disclosure, precise accuracy and credibility are imperative.
 Creating these conditions will require the establishment of new institutions and substantial investment in infra structure.
 In many of these countries, the press has freed itself from being solely an instrument of government, but television is still largely under state control.
 In the entire former USSR today there is no adequate agricultural extension service to transmit research findings from the laboratory to the field, especially to small private farmers.
 Poor communications systems are incapable of handling the large volume of telephone, fax, telex and computerized messages needed for commercial linkages with other countries.
 10.Catalytic initiatives can release social dynamism: Social change is facilitated and accelerated by initiatives to introduce or demonstrate new patterns of activity and behaviour appropriate to the goals of the transition.
 One of the most successful initiatives of the Russian government in recent years has been the distribution of millions of small private agricultural plots to urban and rural households.

“Emily, is he okay?” I yelled.
 She looked up and nodded to me.
 I turned back around to see Kojas slash Seth across the stomach.
 That’s when I screamed.
 Seth fell to his knees, holding his midsection.
 His sword fell out of his grip and to the ground.
 Kojas grinned in triumph and kicked Seth to the ground.
 I screamed again, when he didn’t move.
 “At last,” Kojas breathed.
 “Monster!” I cried.

For a long time, Harruq remained.
 He ran a hand through his hair and pondered what in the abyss was wrong with him.
 “Never get involved with elves,” he mumbled.
 “Never ever should have gotten myself screwed up like this.”
 But a part of him liked it, and that scared him even more.
 !
 [section break](break.png)
 Harruq arrived at the clearing the next morning at the same time as always.
 Aurelia stepped out from behind a tree, her cold, emotionless face so different from the previous day.
 “We have sparred our two weeks, Harruq,” she said.

I couldn’t have found my way back if I’d wanted to.
 I had no idea where I was.
 I stared at my palms, some spell-bought map carved into my skin, and was hit full force with the knowledge that I didn’t even know where I was going.
 I was about as low on options as I could get.
 If not for Chevelle’s desire to skip out on Council business for a few days, or whatever we were doing here, I’d already be imprisoned.
 I could hope that with the dreams, with the mountains, with wherever my family’s map was taking me, I could remember more, could break some part free.
 It was all I would have in my captivity.
 It was the mountains or nothing.
 I could see no other way.
 It was days before I spoke to Chevelle again, though he didn’t seem to mind the lack of conversation.

In fact, I heard that it smells very familiar to you.” Rodregas immediately felt ice in his belly; he knew his hint at such knowledge was enough to turn Van’dret fully against him.
 The Immortalist’s eyes blazed with fury and Rodregas had no problem thinking that the Infernal Realms were reflected in those cold eyes.
 Strangely, it was the one who looked the part of an Infernal Daemon that broke the tense moment.
 Doi’van casually stood up and said, “This is the best I can do with this shield and here is your lance.” The Hellborn promptly handed Rodregas the items.
 As Rodregas sat on his horse juggling the gear Doi’van finished with, “Now stop teasing the nice Ambassador and go win a pretty ribbon.” His voice managed to be light and teasing even though it was deep enough to vibrate rock.
 Rodregas realized his best move was to go quickly, before the angry looking sorcerer could act, and he moved Doom Hoof around and into line.
 The judges seemed to pair up the contestants depending on the quality of the armor, either that or Doi’van got lucky.
 His first opponent’s armor was not much better than his own.
 As Doom Hoof plodded forward Rodregas was able to land a solid strike on his opponent’s shield.
 It was probably no less than the strike that he received in return.

We sat side by side on her bed near the window, and I played with the fridge on the edge of one of her pillows.
 I looked down at Emily’s pajamas, which were covered in sun-tanning penguins.
 Typical Emily.
 “Nice PJs Emily.” I chuckled.
 She stuck her tongue out, “What do you have against sun-tanning penguins?” “Nothing!” I smiled to myself.
 I shouldn’t be talking; I was wearing pajamas covered in little pigs.
 Emily leaned back to turn off her desk light.
 It clicked off and I gazed outside one more time before turning around to go to bed.
 “Night Emily.” I yawned.
 Emily didn’t reply because her face was pushed up against the window.

She was notably upset and actually confronted me on my “promise” to sell them to her.
 I pointed out that I waited in a parking lot for her for over an hour and she was the one who flaked.
 I described how easy it was to sell the one hundred Oxys to the other guy and that he met me exactly where I wanted and when I wanted, gave me the cash and it was a breeze!
 She asked me if I had any more and I told her I had a few but not enough to trouble with.
 I then told her that I had a refill available for ninety Oxys that was good to fill next Tuesday.
 I swear I am making this dialogue up as I go along, just to fit all the necessary criteria and to put her off until next Tuesday.
 The new prescription combined with what I already had would meet the quantity of one hundred Oxys that they wanted.
 I also wanted a solid clarification that I was only going to meet on my terms, just as I had in my fictitious deal.
 Did I mention I am in sales?
 Telling her I sold the drugs to someone else is the classic “take-away” which creates an urgency and desire to comply.

 “Nothing.

 “Indeed.

 Your hair is cut.
 You come back every morning bruised.
 What is it that you hide from me?”
 Harruq lowered his eyes in shame.

Part of me hadn't wanted to.
 It had felt like I was abandoning Cindi by doing so, but just seeing Cindi's half of the twin pendants we'd received two years before had been enough to send me into a tailspin.
 A detached part of me noted that it was just like Mom to have lied about having lost Cindi's.
 She'd known I couldn't handle the reminder of what we'd lost, but she'd been unwilling to give up that link to the past.
 The thought slipped away like sunlight skipping across water a split second before the storm arrived.
 The attack was a bad one.
 I lost more time.
 I must have slept at some point, but the next time I surfaced it was Saturday morning and I was sitting in front of an empty bowl with an unopened box of cereal and a gallon of milk waiting in the wings.
 At some point I realized I wasn't hungry.
 I put everything back away and went upstairs for a shower.

 BG: 	We were together about a year, I think.
 It lasted about a year.
 She was there when we recorded some of our first songs, I remember that.
 She loved, uh, “Hayley Mill’s Underpants.”  For some reason, she thought that was her song.
 Maybe because Carol was a young woman who loved lingerie.
 And, as a young man, who appreciated a young woman who loved lingerie, well, we had some fiery times.
 Hot as monkeys.
 She had these little white things…I don’t know where she got ‘em.

 “I’m not like the others.”
 “That so?” Alvrik’s face hadn’t changed in the slightest.
 “Tell me why.”

More like wacky.
 Still, if don't write and share these loco thoughts of mine, not as many people will get to know about Eric, and Olga.
 No doubt Don will read my vision of Eric’s death as sacrifice and consider it a symptom of a narcissistic belief that the world revolves around me.
 The problem I find with such an explanation is, it wouldn’t answer a single question about why Eric knew all he did.
 So I’ll risk having friends like Don intervene to get me committed.
 Because, even if I only saw a long shot chance that Eric died to rescue me, from death, from perdition, from a wasted life, or from a danger I can’t imagine, consider what a cold-blooded wretch I would have to be if I failed to give him his due.
 And Olga was so beautiful, I won't allow her to be forgotten.
 My Girl
 At home after the trip’s longest drive, the whole length of California including the purgatorial L.A. freeways, when Zoë’s grandma leaves I think about waking my girl.

My one little bottle of water wasn't going to last me five miles in this oven, but I was tired of always having to be sensible about everything.
 I was going to walk, and that was it.
 Maybe if I passed out on the side of the road and ended up in the hospital Britney would finally realize what a wench she was.
 I was barely out of sight of the school, still vividly imagining Alec and Britney's faces when they found out that they'd put me in the hospital, when I heard a car approaching from behind me.
 Only it wasn't zipping by, it was slowing down.
 Every scary story I'd ever heard about rapists, kidnappers and murderers suddenly flowed through my mind like frayed ropes catching at my insides as they went, pulling out all of the other thoughts and feelings until there was nothing left but a hollow, fear-filled shell.
 I found myself praying for the first time since the accident, pleading with whatever might be out there listening to protect me and get me safely home.
 My heart was pounding so hard it almost drowned out the crunch of gravel as the car pulled even with me.
 I didn't recognize the vehicle, which was a bad sign.
 It was a light-eating black, and emitted the throaty roar of a sports car.

The Iran–Iraq War, the war in Afghanistan and the Gulf War involved the use of ballistic missiles against civilian centres.
 In all, over 5,000 surface-to-surface missiles have targeted population centres during the last five decades.
 The devastating effect of even conventional weapons on economic activity and society in general is so great that today no developed nation can afford the costs of military confrontation, either at home or overseas.
 No longer can non-combatants sit quietly on the sidelines or work productively undisturbed.
 War both between and within states has come to involve and affect all of society.
 Infrastructure and production facilities have become a principal target of military action.
 Food supplies are frequently the first major casualty and most lethal weapon.
 A single explosion can paralyze a major metropolis or contaminate an entire region with toxic material, dwarfing the devastation caused by the industrial accidents at Chernobyl and Bhopal.
 The disruption of trade resulting even from regional conflicts such as the Gulf War or the war in Bosnia, impacts not only on the economies of the belligerents, but also on neighbours, trading partners and global economic performance.
 Neither the victor nor the victim can any longer afford to resolve conflicts violently.

This was even better since the goal was to get him and she was ancillary.
 I picked up the phone, which was still connected to the recording device, and she introduced herself and said she was calling from her boyfriend’s phone because hers was broken.
 The call went better than expected as you could hear Steve coaching her in the background.
 Ashley fell nicely into all of the comments the police wanted to record.
 I was told by Officer White to tell her I could meet her in a couple of days as I was out of town.
 I told her I would call her when I returned and after work hours.
 She agreed and the call ended.
 At the time, I didn’t understand why we didn’t just go do the deal right away, but the cops needed to get a crew together and do all this planning for the bust.
 Once this part of the deal was confirmed, the officer left the room and returned with a stack of documents for me to sign.
 I didn’t read much of it because it didn’t really matter what it said.

“You will impress him, Harruq, do not worry about that.”
 Qurrah left his brother to rest.
 !
 [section break](break.png)
 “Grab my wrist,” Qurrah said as the dark cloud arrived that night.
 Harruq did so, and together they stepped inside.
 He felt an unseen hand grab his chest, and then they were running blind.
 The minutes crawled, their frantic breathing the only audible sound.
 Qurrah lagged further and further behind, unable to keep the pace.
 Harruq tightened his grip on his wrist and pulled him along.

Harruq sat nearby.
 The spidery, intangible lessons in spellcasting had little to do with him, but he politely remained silent and respected their usefulness
 “Harruq Tun,” Velixar said suddenly, jolting him from his drifting thoughts.
 “Yes, master?” he asked, rising and straightening his back.
 He could feel the eyes of his brother on him and did not wish to disappoint.
 “Qurrah has told me of the troubles in your heart.
 I must see them.”
 “He did?” Harruq asked, glancing at his brother.
 His stomach dropped, and his heart quickened as Velixar approached.
 He felt like a truant servant caught by his master…‌which perhaps he was.

“There you are, my Fredora!” She was always trying out new nicknames for me.
 It was no secret I despised my given name: Elfreda Georgiana Suzetta Glaforia.
 I decided, not for the first time, my father must have been a drunken imp.
 Not that I could remember him, but I could definitely blame him because the father was always responsible for naming the firstborn.
 It wasn’t as if you could get more unoriginal than using the ancient word meaning “elf”, but he certainly hadn’t needed to follow it with a string of ridiculous, flowery—I stopped mid-thought, realizing my tutor was watching me.
 “Hey, Junnie,” I said, forcing a smile.
 “What’s on the schedule for today?” She smiled in return, straightening the deep blue sash that tied her tunic.
 “How do you feel about studying the lineages?” She knew I hated trying to memorize endless pages of names and dates, and didn’t seem surprised by my groan of complaint.
 “Well, let’s get to it then,” she said, leading me through the tiny living area toward the back room.
 She didn’t have or need a great deal of space.

Jason was limping over with a grim expression on his face.
 “What I don’t get a hug too?” he asked.
 “I jumped down a deep hole for you.” “Uh…” I said, feeling awkward.
 Seth walked over and patted Jason on his back.
 “Tell you what, when we defeat Kojas, I’ll give you a hug.” “Uh, fine dude,” Jason said and whispered in Seth’s ear.
 Seth’s eyes widened and he smacked Jason on the head.
 “Dude, you’re crazy,” he said as Jason rubbed and smoothed his hair back down.
 I shook my head and said, “Anyway, Emily how come you two didn’t destroy each other?” “Hey you’re right,” she replied and her brow furrowed.
 “I really don’t know.” “Jazell, we better move or we’ll lose them,” Seth reminded me and started to walk up the hill.
 Emily raised an eyebrow.

Doi’van must have seen him coming from his position and he dropped his bow and pulled his great sword.
 The guard must have been thinking “Forest Nymph” due to the nature of the archery attack from the forest because he was unprepared for the strength of the blow.
 Like the one Rodregas had hit, the sword failed to cut armor.
 The guard, with the speed of his sigil, blocked it.
 But he blocked it sword to sword instead of using the momentum and speed to simply guide the sword away from his body.
 The resulting blow had an unpleasant sound and cut right through Doi’van’s sword.
 Unfortunately for the guard, Doi’van stepped forward as he swung and jammed the lower half of the sword into his opponent’s chest.
 The guard flew into the bushes with a sickening crunching sound.
 Rodregas next heard the sound of another of the enemy and spun into the sound using all his speed and strength, hoping to take a guard with either advantage.
 His target proved to be a slaver.

“Kojas will destroy you, half-ling.” “That is it, I’m sick of your riddles!
 Give me a darn straight answer or I’ll shoot every single one of you,” I spat angrily, leveling my bow.
 “Kill all you like half-ling, but that won’t help you in the end.
 You will pay heavily in a terrible death worth all the loyal lives you’ve slayed,” the dwarf proclaimed, and his friends bellowed out an agreement.
 “I don’t care what the heck you say about dying because nothing will stop me from killing all of you!
 You’re making no apparent sense at all, and I don’t care what stupid message you’re trying to send me!” I hissed so bad I think that I spit.
 Gross.
 “Oh but you will care, half-ling.” The dwarf was now whispering and all the others had fallen silent so they could hear.
 “You will care because in the end, he will destroy you once he’s done using you.” My arms were still tense and my muscles whined in protest as I held my arrow back in full draw.
 “Use me to do what?” I spoke, using the same tone as him.

Doi’van guessed that it had been the chain of the large overweight slaver that he had killed.
 While the equipment was all of average quality, Rodregas was smiling because clearly there were three sets of everything plus a pack horse for equipment.
 Imeralda was clearly planning on joining them.
 While that is what his heart hoped for he was not sure if it was the smartest move.
 When they were working on the tack for the horses, he went ahead and asked.
 “Imeralda, I want to make sure you want to continue with us.
 I mean I love to travel with you, but while Doi’van and I are warriors, when you joined us it was only as a travel companion.
 If you want to stay with the village or stay with Jordaan I will understand.
 You know that by now they will be hunting us, if not because of Ravenhurr’s death, than because of the missing Immortal Guards.” “You know that I probably killed more slavers with the Black Yew bow than either you or Doi’van right?” asked Imeralda with a snort.
 “Your abilities are not of question,” Rodregas responded.

Emily jumped out from behind the trees and lifted a flame.
 She twirled it around with the movement of her hands and shot it at the nearest dwarf.
 That started what seemed like a war.
 All the dwarfs scrambled towards us and I simply shot them and Emily fried them.
 Then Jason and Seth dissolved from the shadows and entered the clearing.
 “What are you two doing here?” I yelled across to them, annoyed that they hadn’t made their presence known earlier.
 Seth fought his way over to me, “Why do you need to know?” “Because you just randomly appeared and I would like to know what you’re doing in Emily’s backyard in the middle of the night.” I pointed out and took down the last dwarf.
 We gathered around the barely burning embers, after we had re-entered our own world.
 Emily and I quickly summed up what we had learned from the dwarfs.
 Jason listened and didn’t speak, like usual, and for once Seth didn’t interrupt.

Ahrqur let out a mocking laugh, gave him an obvious feint, and then kicked high.
 The foot smashed the bottom of Harruq’s chin, the same sore part Dieredon had hit.
 Harruq staggered back, his sword swinging wildly.
 The elf charged in, knowing he outmatched the half-orc in speed and skill.
 The kill would be his.
 “ _Hemorrhage._ ”
 A sudden purging of blood vessels exploded across Ahrqur’s side.
 The force smashed him into a decorative table.
 He rolled off the broken thing and glanced down at the blood soaking his robe.
 Despite the wound, no cut or hole was visible in the cloth.

Hardly sounds like an orcish thing to do.”
 One would not have thought gray skin could turn so red, but it did.
 “Well, I still want to repay you.” Harruq held out a small bag containing copper coins.
 “It’s all I have.
 Please, take it.”
 Aurelia glanced at the bag.
 “No,” she said.
 “But why?”
 The elf shook her head.
 “Your swords.

“Why do we fight?” she asked again, desperately trying to block every swing.
 Blood covered her arms, and another swing cut through her dress, slicing into the beautiful flesh of her leg.
 “Why, Harruq?
 Why!”
 “I don’t know!” he cried.
 Strength surged into him, dark and unholy.
 In the blink of an eye, he twirled both swords, knocked Aurelia’s staff from her hand, and then looped his right arm all the way around to bury Condemnation deep into her stomach.
 Everything, all fighting, all arguing, all bleeding, living and dying halted at that moment.
 For Harruq, there was only the sight of Aurelia doubled over, her eyes filled with sadness.
 His arm yanked the blade out of her, without any thought on his part.

Democracy, Peace and Development
 The first is a revolutionary movement from authoritarianism to democracy that has travelled around the world during the past decade.
 The initial wave swept through Latin America in the early 1980s, replacing military regimes in Peru, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Paraguay and Bolivia.
 In 1979, 12 out of 19 Latin American countries had authoritarian governments.
 By 1993, every country except Cuba and Haiti had a democratically elected government.
 Glasnost and perestroika in the USSR initiated a second and more powerful tide of freedom that expanded rapidly through Eastern Europe and then to other continents, in the same way that India’s attainment of freedom from colonial rule gave birth to a host of freedom movements and new nations after the Second World War.
 The number of single-party or military states and people under autocratic rule has fallen dramatically since 1980, and the trend continues.
 This shift to multi-party democracy, when coupled with a free press and an independent judiciary, vastly reduces the threat of large-scale wars similar to those that have twice shaken the world in this century.
 Three factors are at play in most conflict situations: the absence of developed democratic institutions, the absence or abuse of fundamental human rights, and the inability to make those choices in the management of public policy on which good governance depends.
 Authoritarian governments find justification for their existence in the presence of external threats to national security, in times of war and during periods of imperialist expansionism.

“Sir Rodregas, you look good for having just completed the tournament this day,” said Gorin.
 “I would not expect you to be moving around much yet.” Rodregas nodded.
 He could not explain that he already had a minor sigil of healing.
 He simply smiled and said, “I am too excited to lie down and groan in pain!
 My mind races with the possibilities.
 Now that I am officially a knight, I want to bring my sworn men into the chamber and figure out what sigils I will choose.” At his words the men’s faces tightened and they looked at his supposed servants.
 Rodregas nodded his understanding.
 He also knew from his own ‘illustrious’ career as a guard that the others would follow the rules.
 They were not officers to be making judgments.
 “I know you don’t like my servants being a Hellborn and a Nymph,” he said keeping his voice light.

Not with everything hanging over our heads."
 It felt funny to smile.
 The gesture belonged with perfect times, not ones in which people other than me were having nervous breakdowns.
 Then again, a bad night with Alec still somehow managed to beat most other good nights.
 "Everything was almost perfect.
 If there was anything less than ideal, it wasn't your fault."
 "Still, I'd like to make it up to you."
 He looked down at my ankle and then smiled with a hint of mischievousness.
 "I suppose dancing is out, but I think I've got something that'll do just about as well."
 Alec carefully picked me up before I could respond.

 Unless you’re the person being named Eugene or Wesley, then it’s scary.

And they might help save Neal Cassady.
 Shanghai
 While going through my boxes of Eric’s treasures, I find myself hoping that somehow God, in eternity, will bless Sylvia in spite of her meanness.
 I loved her, though in a guarded way.
 I tried to help her, and she gave me plenty in return, most of it dark, but nevertheless worth pondering.
 Each time we got together, we talked about books and ideas.
 Here is the conclusion of her favorite poem, "The Night They Burned Shanghai":
 Tonight Shanghai is burning, And we are dying too.
 What bomb more surely mortal Than death inside of you?
 For some men die by shrapnel, And some go down in flames, But most men perish inch by inch, In play at little games.

 "I don't know.

 She smiled.

Doctor – (really into drawing on one of the papers on the clipboard and not really paying attention)  (speaks periodically throughout Character 1’s monologue without looking up) Zat is very interesting!
 Fascinating!
 Character 1- Well and then there was father…I never met him personally, but mother said that he was hard at work at his job of making license plates for the state, and from time to time she would point one out and say ‘kids, your father might have made that one’ or some other such thing, it wasn’t until I was sixteen that I found out that dad was in prison as a serial jay-walker and general public nuisance.
 (notices the doctors obsession with the drawing)  Um what are you doing?
 Doctor – (startled) I am writing notes on your fascinating case, it’s a thing that we doctors do you know.
 Ya, we doctors write notes all the time, in fact I am writing them now.
 Character 1- (reaches for the clipboard) May I see the notes?
 Doctor – (slaps the incoming hand, and clutches the clip-board to his chest) Nein!
 These are confidential, and, uhhhh, it would violate the doctor-patient relationship if I allowed you or anyone to see them.
 Character 1- Oh, sorry about that, well shall I take up where I left off?

Harruq gave her no answer.
 Instead, he stabbed with Salvation, a higher thrust of Condemnation trailing behind it.
 Aurelia turned her staff horizontal and pushed upward.
 Both swords stabbed high above her head.
 A quick turn and one end of her staff rammed the half-orc in the gut.
 The blow knocked the wind out of Harruq.
 “For what reason do we fight?” she asked.
 “For what reason do you harbor this hatred?”
 He glared.
 “I told you.

Gracella almost physically jumped at the suggestion and could not help herself from a quick glance around the hall before responding.
 “I don’t think Taiga has any interest in becoming Guild Master, or he would be Guild Master.
 I am just concerned about Master Oreintvenir.” She said.
 “I think the Guild Master can take care of himself just fine, for all we know he quietly ascended and is in the Celestial Heavens laughing at us now.” Gracella nodded, but Van’dret knew her thoughts were the same as any Immortalist at the conversation of Ascension to the Celestial Realm.
 If you succeeded people would know a new God walked the Heavens.
 If you failed the ceremony the only sign would be silence.
 “So what did he want?” she asked.
 Van’dret hesitated for a moment, not sure if he should respond.
 But, Gracella was an impressive Immortalist and a rising star in the Guild.
 She had been Oreintvenir own Adapt when she was young, and as a favored member of the Guild, her friendship could prove important some day.

Alec sighed, presumably in resignation, and then suddenly my legs were thrown up in front of me as he picked me up with inhuman speed.
 Only the steady pressure of Alec's arm around my waist kept me from screaming, and then I was back on my feet, and being carefully, but firmly shoved through a tangled knot of bodies.
 My shoes had never been intended to allow ankles to withstand that kind of punishment.
 Even just walking had been risky, so it wasn't a surprise when my right foot slipped, and a sharp knife of pain shot through that ankle as it collapsed under me.
 Dealing with blinding agony hadn't ever been my strong point.
 I opened my mouth to scream, only to find that no sound would come out.
 The world was still spinning, but I was oriented just enough to realize that Dominic had her hand over my mouth and nose.
 I pulled at her arm, but the effort was completely futile.
 Rising panic over not being able to breathe made me hammer at the iron bar pressing me against her, but she never looked away from whatever had captured her concentration.
 Rachel suddenly appeared off to my right, and she put her finger to her lips, and then sank all ten fingernails into Dominic's arm.

The man in black put a hand on either side of Qurrah’s face and drew him close.
 “Become a god among men,” he whispered.
 “Remain faithful to me, and to Karak, and I shall see it come to pass.”
 Qurrah nodded but said nothing.
 Instead, he turned and joined his brother.
 “Let’s go home,” he said.
 “I’m thinking that’s a great idea,” Harruq said.
 The two stepped around the bodies of the slain as they headed east, leaving Velixar alone in the emptiness of Cornrows.
 “Incredible,” Velixar said when they were gone.
 “Never would I have guessed they had such power.” He paused, listening to the words of his master.

More people are working than ever before, yet at the same time more people are unemployed, because a larger proportion of the population seek jobs.
 Growing anxiety about employment prospects in the West were aggravated by a sudden 50 per cent increase in unemployment after 1990, which displaced an additional 10 million workers in the OECD and was equalled only by the previous high of 1983.
 This increase is now showing signs of reversal.
 These average figures disguise significant differences in performance of countries within the OECD.
 Since 1950, Japan’s employment rate has risen from 43 per cent to around 50 per cent, while unemployment has remained in the 1 to 3 per cent range.
 The overall proportion of the population employed in the European Community has declined by 1 per cent since 1965 and is presently just under 41 per cent, but the percentage of the working age population employed has remained more or less constant over the past three decades, at 67 per cent, whereas in other OECD regions it has risen significantly – to exceed 75 per cent in North America, Scandinavia and Japan.
 Europe’s lower labour participation rate is attributable to a number of factors.
 A far higher percentage of the European workforce was engaged in agriculture 25 years ago and has since shifted to non-agricultural sectors, an adjustment that occurred in the United States during earlier decades.
 During the 1980s Europe chose a high-wage path to growth, passing on the benefits to the existing workforce but creating relatively few new jobs; whereas the United States, with a similar economic growth rate over the decade, showed lower income growth per worker, but a steadily rising employment rate.
 Europe is now confronted with the need for structural adjustment to compensate.

“One free pass,” Velixar said, observing the flight of elves as they swarmed overhead.
 They banked around, still in perfect formation, and then dove again.
 “Kill them now!” he ordered, his fingers crooking into strange shapes.
 “ _Hemorrhage!_ ” Qurrah hissed, pointing at the nearest horse.
 Blood ruptured from the beautiful creature’s neck.
 The rider steadied her best he could, knowing his doom approached.
 They crashed into the inky blackness, crushing bodies underneath before the swarming dead tore them to pieces.
 Velixar’s first attack was far more impressive.
 Bits of bone ripped out from his undead army; femurs, fingers, ribs, and teeth flew into the sky in a deadly assault.
 The elves broke formation as the barrage approached.

He comes from a small town, and everyone knew what happened.
 I think he married a girl from Russia, one of those mail-order brides.
 I think that she was desperate to get out of Russia.
 The terrible poverty and such just made her desperate to get out of the country.
 Art – Well as long as she’s pretty.
 Other wise, well I can’t imagine that he has much self-confidence left.
 Karen – I’ve seen a couple of pictures, she isn’t.
 Art – Stay in Russia and have no foreseeable future, or come to the United States and marry a stranger who just happens to turn out to be a contributor to the growth of the lesbian community.
 I wonder what would happen to the poor man if she decided to go back to Russia as a lesbian.
 Karen – I don’t know, I hope it never happens to him, my family would make his life hell if they ever found out.

Aurelia summoned a magical shield about her body.
 The fireballs thudded three feet from her body and detonated.
 The two nearest buildings crumpled, their walls and roofs blown back by the power.
 The elf winced, nearly knocked to her knees by the force.
 “What madness gives you such a desire?” she asked, sending forth the strongest spells she knew.
 Several lances of ice flew down the street, followed by a ball of magma.
 The ball rolled behind the lances, covering the ground in flame.
 Velixar laughed.
 A wave of his hand created a similar shield as Aurelia’s, but instead of keeping it close to his body, he shoved it forward.
 The lances shattered into shards when slammed against it.

Though I didn’t understand at the time, I was asking if they felt the darkness in their nature, the affinity for sin.
 Somewhere, I read, "All sin is the result of the failure to love."
 Over lots of years, I have noted voluminous evidence for that idea, and not a shred against it.
 My last summer in Chico, I was sorely depressed, living too far from my family and confused about most everything.
 And I discovered the best I could do to relieve depression was turn my thoughts and concerns from myself to others.
 Even the feeling like a rock in my belly went away.
 Love heals.
 Along with The Practice of the Presence of God and some mysteries, I have been reading about Feodor Dostoyevski's philosophical positions, because the issues he tackled a century and a half ago are still remarkably current.
 In Dostoyevski the Thinker, I discovered a passage written following the death of his first wife.
 Since I have the book with me, I pull into a turnout overlooking the Pacific, find the passage and reread it.

His sister.
 Traveling with us.
 An asset.
 I leaned forward, resting my head on my knees.
 “Are you ill?” Chevelle said from beside me.
 I hadn’t even heard him come in.
 He was sitting forward on the bench next to me and when I jerked up in surprise, it put us too close.
 I tottered and he steadied me, but didn’t move away.
 He leaned closer.
 “You smell… like morning.” I bit my lip, heat rising up my neck, but he lingered, breathing in the scent.

It wasn't until I'd returned Mrs. Alexander's reference book to its shelf and sat down at my desk that I remembered I'd had to do the entire 'group' project by myself.
 Alec hadn't even bothered to come to Physics since the assignment had been given.
 My entire life I'd had people try and sponge off of my work, and I was way beyond sick and tired of it.
 By the time Alec strode into class looking like the inspiration for every romance novel ever written, I was really mad.
 I hardly waited for him to sit down before I pulled my desk a little closer and hissed at him.
 "So very nice of you to come to class on the day our stupid assignment is due."
 Alec's expression was remarkable in that I'd never seen anyone look so full of life while simultaneously failing to betray even the slightest hint of emotion.
 He didn't even open his mouth as he reached into his bag and pulled out a bundle of densely-packed typewritten pages.
 The arrogance of it all.
 He hadn't even bothered to consult with me before typing up an answer that was probably completely off base.

His voice seemed mesmerizing as he continued, “Her mother was a fairy from the West.
 Fiery one, her.” I wrapped my arms around my legs, holding my knees tight, and placed my chin there to rest my head.
 “Tell me more.” It was all I could do to pay attention to his words, but I was fascinated by their sound.
 “Her father was a dark elf.
 When her mother died during childbirth, he left her here in the village.
 I suppose it was for the best, really, since she can’t fly.
 The fairies would have tormented her.
 She’s still a bit of an outcast though.” He was still talking as I struggled to catch up in my head.
 I interrupted him, unable to stop myself.
 “My mother died.” I had no idea why I was speaking.

I found myself wanting Steed to win and leaned with his strikes, tensing as if they were my own.
 Grey bounded through the air once more, showing off, confident in his evident lead, and then a small rock rose at chest height in front of Steed.
 I was trying to figure out who had lifted it when Grey flashed back into view, hesitating only a moment as he considered the rock.
 At once, his face changed; he knew he’d been beaten.
 As he’d paused to study the floating rock, Steed had immobilized him and, just like that, the match was over.
 Ruby leaned into me, voice soft.
 “Steed is stronger than Grey.
 He only needed to catch him.” Grey conceded, his walk slower, movements no longer jerky as he made his way out of the makeshift ring.
 Steed threw me a quick wink.
 Anvil approached next, stepping into the same starting position Grey had used, and Steed shifted several paces back before he readied himself and nodded toward his new opponent.

A large bed topped with decorated pillows and colorful blankets centered the opposite wall, twice the size of the one I’d been using.
 A tall rack in the corner was draped with materials—deep violet and emerald-green silks, dark wools, and a rainbow of patterned scarves.
 Shelves alongside were filled full with curiosities and a few books lay on the bedside table near a lantern.
 I stepped into the tub, sinking down as lavender-scented steam rose to dampen my face and hair.
 I breathed deep.
 It seemed to be helping, so I closed my eyes and relaxed.
 The water started to chill several times, but I was hesitant to get out.
 At the risk of boiling myself, I eased the magic I’d been using to reheat the bath.
 Finally, I felt well enough to stand.
 I picked up one of the soaps and washed quickly, then pulled the water from the tub to rinse the suds away.

 Qurrah did not know what to say or do as he watched his master die.
 His entire world had just come crashing down in the darkness.
 Above him were more than fifty elves, each one eager to bury an arrow in his back.
 “Harruq,” he said, crawling amid the bodies.
 He desperately hoped none would spot him.
 He reached a large stinking corpse lying on its back with a golden arrow in its forehead.
 Qurrah shoved the cadaver onto its side, curled underneath, and then let it fall atop him.
 The weight crushed his fragile body and the smell was awful, but it was his only cover.
 Miserable, he hid there, quietly whispering.

“Everyone think!” “How can I think,” I screeched back, “when the ground is rushed towards me at full speed?” “I don’t know Jazell, just think if you want to live,” she said quickly.
 I let out another scream as my body tipped towards the edge of the dragon.
 I felt someone wrap their arm around me and I gave a grunt as I was pulled upright.
 Seth held me, his arm stiff and somewhat uncomfortable.
 I was frozen in fear, realizing that I hated falling.
 This was worse than my fear of rollercoasters.
 “Calm down,” Seth said to me.
 “You’re not going to fall-” “What do you mean, Seth?” I said in a panicked voice.
 “We’re freaking falling right now!” Emily looked at us and she tried to hide the fear in her face.
 “The dragon is going to pull its wings around us to protect us from falling but it’s going to make us fall faster.

It depends on the understanding and will of people.
 The evolution of larger, heterogeneous national units functioning under principles of equality is an outstanding product of civilization that should not and cannot be reversed without great damage to the general welfare of humanity.
 The only solution is to work constantly to educate the public in all countries to understand the benefits of national integration and international cooperation.
 The implications of this view will be endorsed by some and opposed by others.
 Acceptance must be fostered through education and discussion rather than unilateral forced initiative.
 Preventive Diplomacy, Peace Making and Peace Building
 The answers to the questions regarding national sovereignty and international responsibility will determine the scope of UN preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace building in years to come.
 They must be addressed with a view to evolving valid principles of international law, rather than remaining subject to frequent reversals of public policy by member states based on the short-term impact of the media on current public opinion.
 Granted that a consensus is reached regarding these larger issues of principle, there still will remain immense problems relating to implementation, as illustrated by the recent failure of international intervention in Somalia.
 Whatever may be the limits placed on the UN’s mandate for action, it is clear that it cannot carry out that mandate effectively under the current constraints imposed on it by member states through indecisiveness, narrowly defined interests and lack of political commitment.

A drunken homecoming queen could fall into your lap and coo about how much cuter you are than her boyfriend who has gone to puke in the alley.
 We chose one of the quieter nightclubs.
 Still, it was crowded, so we shared a table with two friendly Marines.
 In a few months, Cliff would get drafted.
 Neither of us were anxious to shoot anybody or die as heroes.
 But Cliff’s dad fought in Korea and wasted no respect on anybody who let other boys go to war while he attended college.
 Even before our tequila arrived, the Marines were telling us about a training film.
 It showed photos of camouflaged pits where guys fell onto sharpened and poisoned poles, and tunnels through which soldiers had to crawl chasing invisible warriors.
 Maybe the thoughts of death by poison or stabs in the dark made my stomach roil.
 Or maybe the cause was the sight of a dancer on the stage beside the bar.

 but for that reason, she wanted to make love with him.
 But how could she do that and then leave him forever?
 How could she give herself to him so completely and then walk away from him?
 With effort, she made herself roll off him, but she couldn't resist cuddling up against him.
 "I wish I could say yes.
 I love you, Rick."
 He didn't respond for a few moments, needing to let his desire ebb.
 "If I hadn't asked you, if I'd just gone on kissing you and touching you, we would have made love.

With a sigh of resignation I found my place on the page again, and started sorting out another set of variables.
 Forty-five minutes later I'd nearly completed another two sections, and was more than ready for a breather.
 Sometime while I'd been studying, most of the kids had left.
 I hadn't expected all of them to stay until my shift started, but I'd expected more than the two or three I usually had.
 Only it didn't look like that was going to be the case.
 Apparently most of them hadn't been serious about learning the material--they'd just wanted to come to the lab, make a half-hearted attempt, and then leave secure in the knowledge that if they failed the test they could whine to their parents about how hard they'd worked.
 But Mom, I even went to the lab.
 It sort of made sense though.
 If they'd been serious about acing the test, they'd have been here every night for the last two weeks instead of trying to cram a few more morsels of knowledge into their heads at the last minute.
 Mentally shrugging at the stupidity of it all, I pulled out my Spanish and studied my vocab for a few more minutes until Mrs. Campbell came by to wish me goodbye.

The armor was braided leather with steel scales attached; he quickly tried it on and found it to be a perfect fit.
 It was probably custom made and was solid, if unspectacular, quality armor.
 The braided, lacquered leather reinforced with the steel scales provided decent protection for most fights.
 This style of armor was vulnerable to a highly skilled swordsman.
 But for someone wanting some protection from the dangers of the road, it was better than most civilian armor.
 There were matching pants and even boots.
 He quickly dressed and felt much better once armored.
 He had spent most of his adult life in armor; he just could not relax when he wore only clothes.
 Rodregas then looked around; the keep armory was pretty basic with casks of arrows and spears, and some of the older used short swords and bows on the wall.
 There were only two truly powerful weapons like those used by a member of the Immortal Guards – the soldiers that enforced the rule of the Immortalist Guild of the Celestial Path who ruled all the Eastern Kingdoms and neither of these weapons were kept in the armory.

Well, she'd have to put on her thinnest cotton dress.
 She'd like to just keep Rick's t-shirt on.
 No, she thought, stripping it off.
 She didn't want to get her own perspiration on it.
 She shouldn't wear it.
 She should get a big doll or stuffed animal and put the shirt on it.
 Then she could sleep with it in her arms.
 The evening out with her family was wonderful, but when she awoke the next morning, it was with the same confused mixture of happiness and panic that she'd felt when she'd thought about leaving Rick and coming home.
 Her breathing shallow, she sat up and tried to calm herself.
 She and her mother were going shopping today, and it would be an exciting day.

The opportunity is not only further to reduce the threat of war by reducing the capacity for waging war, but also to redirect and utilize for other purposes the resources now dedicated to war making and prevention.
 The challenge is to do so at a time when rising unemployment and economic stagnation in many countries make further cuts in the size of the military unpopular domestically.
 Since 1990, the total number of military personnel worldwide has declined by two million or about six per cent.
 By 1998, a further decrease of at least two million is anticipated.
 A large proportion of these demobilized people have already joined, or will soon join, the forces of the unemployed.
 Some may be tempted to market their military skills elsewhere.
 Just as the present efforts of the UN to make and keep the peace are severely constrained by the lack of a standing professional military force under its own direction, so also the prodigious efforts of the UN’s development agencies to accelerate development among member countries is hampered by a lack of well-trained, disciplined and highly organized personnel for implementation, especially in those countries with the greatest need of assistance.
 The Commission recommends that, as a complement to the establishment of an International Force for Peace, an International Force for Development be constituted, comprised of former military personnel who, after appropriate training, will work to accelerate economic development to provide food, health, literacy and jobs for all.
 A UN Peace Force and UN Development Force, functioning under a democratically restructured UN, can make a lasting contribution to achieving the major goals of the UN system.

All you gotta do is take it out a coupla miles, pick up some items, bring’em in.
 You’re game, right?” After considering the looks worn by the midget, Johnny, and even the babe, we said, “Right.
 You bet.” Johnny drove us to a row of affordable motels, parked at the curb and pointed to one of them.
 “I’ll come for you tomorrow.
 Say 6:30.
 You’ll be waiting out front.
 Right?” “Right.” We stopped at the door to the lobby, looked back and saw Johnny’s convertible turn the corner.
 Then we hoisted our suitcases and double-timed up the road.
 We stayed at the cheapest motel, about a half-mile north.
 In the morning we hitchhiked to Fort Lauderdale.

 Liz – No, it involves painting in a dark room.

He slipped away, and then we'd entered a brightly-lit room filled with the rest of the pack.
 Alec had picked me up and carried me out to a massive SUV that I'd never seen before.
 Everyone piled in, and despite the seriousness of rapidly approaching events, I fell back asleep somewhere en route to our destination.
 Apparently you couldn't drive all the way though, because we were walking again, or at least some of us were.
 I could just make out Isaac off a little ways into the darkness.
 He was in hybrid form and moving with a ground-devouring gait that was deceptively smooth.
 Flashes of movement off to either side of us, lower to the ground, made me sure the girls were all following along on four legs.
 Alec shifted me around as he realized I was awake.
 "We've still got nearly half an hour, you should get some more sleep if you can."
 I tried to argue but couldn't find the strength.

My voice caught, and it took a couple of tries to get actual words out.
 "She'll come after me."
 Brandon shook his head.
 "I won't let her.
 That's part of why I wanted to talk to you.
 I won't let anyone do anything to you.
 Think of it as repayment."
 The words weren't anything special, but there was something about the way he said them that made me absolutely sure he'd deliver on his promise, that he was somehow completely in control of his surroundings.
 The intensity in his stare was too much, and I found myself looking away, trying to buy some time to collect myself.
 Luckily I wasn't so far gone as to not recognize where we were.

Emily raised an eyebrow.
 “Loose who?” “We’ll explain later!” I said and ran after Seth.
 “Right now we have to move!” We dashed up the hill in the direction the monsters were going.
 When we reached the top, Seth stopped and stared down.
 Emily and Jason looked confused but joined us.
 We looked down at the ground and I gasped as I saw all the monsters gather around in a semi-circle, waiting.
 “What are they waiting for?” Emily asked in a hushed voice.
 Seth squinted down.
 “I don’t want to know.” “Do you think it could…?” I asked.
 “Let’s hope not,” Seth interrupted me.

I couldn’t find my body; I wanted to bring my hands to my head, cover my ears.
 But I couldn’t feel anything aside from the pain in my mind.
 I focused all of my energy on finding some feeling somewhere and finally, though the terror was unrelenting, I felt my body again, knew it was there.
 It still didn’t respond, but I knew I hadn’t fallen with the horse.
 Something had caught me.
 Not the ground, not a rock.
 Someone was carrying me.
 The horror must have stretched time, making the few seconds seem like minutes.
 I struggled to bring myself back.
 I could hear nothing but a piercing squall.

Harruq closed his eyes, his fingers shaking.
 Deep within his chest, he felt a rage steadily growing.
 When Velixar had first given the strength to him, he’d felt an overwhelming desire to use it.
 Anger swelled inside, and when he looked to Aurelia he felt an enormous desire to attack.
 She was questioning his master, his brother, questioning what it meant to be him.
 When he opened his eyes, Aurelia stood, shocked by the red light wafting like smoke from Harruq’s eyes.
 “You could never know what I am,” he said.
 “I’ve seen what you can be,” she said.
 “Is that not enough?”
 The words stung him.

If properly administered, these programme have proved successful in reducing costs, imparting new skills and identifying false welfare claims.
 Redirect welfare expenses for creating jobs, rather than encouraging idleness, by paying welfare recipients to carry out public service activities in return for welfare payments.
 This requires the identification of employment-intensive programmes that provide clear benefit to the community without interfering with existing business, such as the US Civilian Conservation Corps that built the US National Parks system in the 1930s.
 Expanding or upgrading the educational system would be a priority area.
 16.Make income distribution more equitable: The number of jobs available is directly related to patterns of income distribution.
 In Japan and other dynamic Asian economies, the ratio between the bottom and top pay is as much as 5 or 10 times lower than in the United States.
 A highly skewed income distribution results in lower levels of overall demand, growth and job creation.
 Lopsided income distribution fuels speculative investment, more and more of which goes overseas.
 The average wages for production workers in the United States are the lowest they have been since 1967, with 18 per cent of full-time workers not earning enough to keep a family of four out of poverty, up from 12 per cent in 1979.
 Income redistribution in the industrialized countries requires structural adjustments similar to those which the West has advocated for developing countries.

Each syllable was slow torture, garbled in blood and born of pain most horrid.
 Thankfully, the spell was not complicated, and the words were few.
 He finished the spell mere seconds before his mind succumbed to the sleep that crawled at his eyes.
 Even though he was dead, life energy still swirled inside the elf’s body.
 Normally this energy would be consumed by the earth in burial, but Qurrah had other plans.
 His spell took in this life energy through his hand, filling his body with it, healing his wounds and clearing his mind.
 The darkness fighting for control in his head subsided, a shred of strength returning to his limbs.
 There was still the slight problem of the arrow lodged in his throat.
 Qurrah had a solution but it was far from pleasant.
 Most likely he would die, but he had to try.

Knew you’d be missing me.” I tried to smile, but the thought of trackers had taken the thrill off the unexpected visit.
 The vision of flames was threatening again and I swallowed hard.
 Chevelle threw on his cloak, hood up.
 “Stay here,” he ordered me.
 He gestured toward Steed, who turned to follow him outside.
 I wasn’t sure how long they’d be gone; I went to one of the narrow windows on the front wall and peered cautiously out.
 They were nowhere to be seen, but the sights of the village distracted me quickly enough.
 It was so unlike home.
 Night gave the gray stones an even darker appearance, the firelight glinting off their ragged edges like polished onyx.
 Torches lit each walkway and building.

The elves of Woodhaven have ignored this edict, ignored the laws of the great kingdom in which they live.
 This will not be tolerated any longer.
 All elves must leave the city, which being outside the forest of Erze, falls inside our borders.
 Those who do not immediately leave will be forced out at the edge of a sword.
 These are the words of our great King Vaelor, and may they be never forgotten.”
 Antonil rolled up the scroll in silence.
 Only coughs and the shifting sounds of uncomfortable armor filled the air.
 Seconds passed, slow and crawling.
 “If one may speak for the elves of the city, please let him come forth,” the guard captain shouted.
 “I seek the answer of the elven kind.

He lingered there, unable to resist touching the broken skin of my lips, even if it were only feather light, the barest brush of skin.
 He drew away slowly, feeling my shock, or seeing it in my eyes, and realizing his mistake.
 His expression fell, but he didn’t take his hands away.
 He swallowed hard, waiting for my confirmation.
 But I wasn’t the other Elfreda, not the long list of binding words that had been my identity for so long.
 I couldn’t seem to reconcile the two lives.
 “I… I think I’m just Frey.” Chevelle’s hands slid to my shoulders, tension in his grip.
 “That’s okay,” Ruby assured me.
 “We will find the others,” Chevelle promised, his jaw tight.
 I couldn’t tell if the pledge was meant for me or himself.

I haven’t seen much of my family in years, those people are nuts.
 They’re bizarre on the odd days as well as the even.
 That and a rift opened between us about my wife.
 I found that I preferred her company over that of my family.
 Karen – And then she left you.
 Art – Yep, and she called evil-incarnate.
 Ignoring my family was one of the reasons she sited.
 If it hadn’t of happened to me, then the irony would have had me rolling on the floor laughing my ass off.
 Karen – Embarrassing things are so much funnier when they happen to strangers.
 It always hurts when they happen to you, and some other jerk finds it funny.

Jim – I’m thinking that two nothings is nothing.
 Art – Sit back and listen to your old man, you’ll learn something, hopefully.
 Jim – What if I don’t end up learning anything?
 Art – Then I’ll finally have proof that you were dropped on your head as a baby.
 Jim – You mean you need more proof than my miss-shapen head?
 Art – That would most likely be genetic.
 Both your mother and I are reasonably smart individuals, as were our parents.
 If you’re dumb, well then your head must have been tampered with after you were removed from the packaging.
 Jim – Always possible, though I think if anything is wrong it’s because of designer flaws.
 Well, shall we get going ‘O’ he who understands women?

My love for him and our effort and commitment to him as his parents wasn’t as strong as his desire to ingest Oxy.
 Brandon’s addiction to this drug was more powerful than anything I could offer and all the love Lisa and I could show.
 My wife woke to my screaming and she was as shocked as I was when I showed her the test results.
 Brandon had to want to get better.
 As he packed his meager belongings, I grabbed the hand held video player and replayed the footage I had taped of him detoxing.
 He begged me to stop the video as he could hear himself on it screaming in agony as his body craved this drug.
 Brandon was crying uncontrollably as he tried to look away from the video that I continued to shove in front of his face.
 Lisa stood there pale and exhausted, frightened like the night of his intervention.
 As I remember it, she resembled my mother, so many years before, when we visited Thomas in prison.
 Lisa could not add even a word.

Marie would wear her mother's wedding gown, which had been carefully stored away for the last 28 years.
 Marie's grandmother had worn it as well, and when Marie took it off after her own wedding, it would go into storage for her daughter.
 Davis chose the next day to approach her father.
 "Come in, my boy," Jefferson Tranton told him, waving the young man into a large, comfortable chair opposite his own in his den.
 "You seemed rather anxious when you telephoned last night."
 "I have to confess that I was.
 Still am."
 He offered his employer a slight smile.
 "You and I have discussed this before, but never officially.
 I would like to do so now.

Not like I miss him."
 For a second I thought he was going to argue with her.
 His tired smile had the feel of resignation, of something that'd been well argued over the years.
 "Will you play something for us, Mother?
 Adriana hasn't had the pleasure of listening to your songs."
 I'd rarely seen anyone change moods so quickly.
 "No.

 Yes, you can bring Rachel, but I can't let anyone listen to it before it's ready."

With a quick twist of the key he removed her iron shackles but grabbed her arm hard so she could not run.
 “This way,” Rodregas said to her.
 As he separated her from the male prisoner he whispered to her, “If you want to live, don’t do anything until your circle starts to burn, then I will throw the club at the other guard.
 Run and make sure you get out of the circle.” She jerked towards him as he spoke and Rodregas was struck once again by the beauty of her amazing eyes, but he forced her forward hoping that she could think on her feet.
 Rodregas carefully led her over the outer white circle and into a yellow circle that was across from the Celestial Lion.
 Captain Poir led the man into the pale green circle that was the closest to being in the exact middle and was most strongly interconnected to the other circles.
 As Rodregas crossed into the main circle, the sense of power almost made him stumble.
 He knew his own power was minimal, not much above average, but his few years of training as a boy had opened him up to magic more than the other three guards on the tower roof.
 Rodregas knew that if Ravenhurr had ever thought he had more than basic magic training he would long have been reassigned to a duty far from the ceremony.
 The very air seemed to strum like a stringed instrument with the gathered magical power.

All four legs of the desk broke beneath the impact of my body.
 I lay there stunned on my back.
 As Dino walked towards me I could see the crowd of guests rushing in behind him.
 He straddled me and I gathered my legs towards my chest with my arms crossed in front of my face to protect myself.
 He looked like a killer standing over me, his eyes big, his teeth gritted and his right fist well above his head poised to pound me again.
 I straightened my right leg out as a kick upward directly into his crotch as hard and fast as I could.
 His body folded around my foot.
 He fell backwards on the ground exposing the crowd of onlookers who stood behind him.
 I stood up and walked by him, looking down at him curled and rolling in obvious agony.
 I walked through the crowd, which parted as I approached.

 Others talk about the size and welcoming essence of Lorelei’s breasts.
 Buddy was mothered; he fed there like a suckling, like a child.
 It wasn’t love but it was something between the sacred and the profane.
 Some say Lorelei was responsible for the beginning of the slide downward for Buddy, filling his head with ideas of stardom, of leaving the backwash of Memphis and making it in a real town like L.A. or Boston.
 Buddy listened to Lorelei, we know that, for better or worse.

Steed chirped a whistle and they walked forward, the slim, muscular one moving to stand beside Chevelle as a mammoth crossed in front of me and knelt.
 I drew in a startled breath at the sheer size and nearness of it.
 Steed shot me a mischievous wink.
 “Well?” I was speechless, mouth agape.
 The thing seemed as large and black as a starless night.
 Steed was pleased with my reaction, but Chevelle’s eyes rolled heavenward.
 He didn’t comment, though, simply holding out a hand to help me mount before swinging onto his own.
 “I will ride with you as far north as Naraguah and then make my way east to trade with the imps at Bray,” Steed told Chevelle.
 I swung a shocked look at my watcher, who simply nodded.
 Steed saw my confusion and gave a disapproving glance in Chevelle’s direction.

But I know we humans can talk ourselves into or out of most anything.
 Books
 One reason I decided to arrange a book signing in Seattle was so I could visit Jaime and Mark Baird and meet their one-year-old Gavin.
 Not long ago, Mark did a tour as an Army psychologist in Iraq.
 Jaime recently earned a Master of Arts degree from Perelandra College, which Pam and I founded about eight years ago, and which I essentially run.
 The college is one of the occupations that keeps me rushing around, the condition that originally clued me I should read Brother Lawrence.
 Pam and I believed God was asking us to found the college to make a place for people in general and Christians in particular who wanted to become writers to discover what they honestly believe, and to write with courage from their unique visions.
 Thinking of Jaime, I can’t begin to lament the virtually endless hurdles we've been called upon to jump in order to earn and maintain the college’s licensing, accreditation and the rest.
 Jaime's thesis is superb.
 A novella about a young woman whose Christian parents, when their daughter finds herself in extreme trouble, appear more concerned with remaining in accord with their church than with helping or even trying to understand their daughter.

 had opened.
 He'd been thinking about Marie's life in 1927--just as he had been when she'd walked into his garden and his life.

 Rick squeezed his eyes shut, thinking about television and microwaves and airplanes.
 When he opened them, most of the fog had evaporated.
 Everything seemed normal.
 The water was gurgling from the frog's mouth.

The world would be better for his absence.
 I could hear the other pack now, panting with exertion, our friends hot on their heels.
 Vincent overreached in his effort to claim the kill, and I sunk my teeth into the muscled flesh of his shoulder as I finally made it around behind him.
 My claws sank into his arms and legs as I repositioned to snap his neck, and then a hammer blow of weight struck me across the shoulders.
 Knocked loose from Vincent, I spun around in time to tear Simon from the air as he leaped at me again.
 It was the perfect opportunity to end a life nearly as evil as Vincent's, but one of the recent arrivals had bowled Jasmin over.
 Leveraging a frame that was more than capable of picking up a small car, I threw Simon into the whirling ball of flesh and fangs.
 He didn't hit hard enough to snap his neck, but he knocked the other wolf off of Jasmin, and then Vincent was back on his feet.
 The rest of the rival pack, save for Brandon their leader, came streaming past, but they didn't help their fellows swarm Jasmin and me over.
 None of them even slowed.

I didn't really want to unpack, but it was long past needing to be done and I knew if I left it to Mom that we'd never really get moved in.
 If I'd had anything even remotely better to do with my Friday night, I would have done it.
 I didn't, so I started with the stuff that we'd piled in the living room because it was marginally cooler downstairs.
 I got into a decent rhythm, opening boxes, pulling out the stuff that I could easily put away, and then consolidating what was left into fewer boxes.
 I was on my fourth box when it happened.
 Mom's jewelry box had somehow got packed into a box labeled 'old photography gear'.
 As I pulled it out to set it to one side, it slipped from my hands.
 The glittering deluge of chains and bracelets that went sliding across the floor would have made me feel bad enough all by themselves, but there was a proverbial scorpion nestled in the midst of all that shininess.
 I'd thrown mine out shortly after the accident.
 Part of me hadn't wanted to.

Hundreds of us lost souls crowded in front of the portable stage somewhere around the goal line.
 I suspected the others, like me, wanted to get near Billy Graham and his giant companions, for comfort and to borrow some of their power.
 The singing giant led a few thousand folks in a hymn.
 “Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling, calling oh sinner come home, come home, come home, ye who are weary come home…” I mumbled the surrender words I heard someone else say, and waited.
 Cliff had stayed beside me.
 I believe he mumbled too.
 I looked for the girl with auburn hair, and wondered if she had bolted, too proud or afraid to surrender.
 Then a kid tapped me on the shoulder.
 I tapped Cliff and we followed the kid.
 He looked about sixteen.

Between one heartbeat and the next he disappeared into the darkness, letting the door slam shut with enough force that the glass in the ceiling should have come down in a rain of razor-edged shards.
 The flowers closest to me swayed slightly from the force of the vibrations, pulling my gaze towards them.
 I felt my heart skip a couple of times and tears start to flood my eyes as I took in beautiful white petals edged in an amazing shade of purple.
 Lagrimas del Angel.
 The whole greenhouse was filled with them, and suddenly I couldn't ignore the significance of the circular signature on the paintings anymore.
 I hurried outside, looked desperately from side to side for some hint of which way he'd gone, and then headed off to the right towards the sound of shattering pottery.
 Just before I was about to give up hope of finding him, I heard another crash and turned into a small grotto.
 The sight of rock walls nearly covered by a swath of greenery caused me to pull up with a suddenness that only barely saved me from tumbling into the small reflecting pool off to one side.
 Alec froze at my appearance, a large planter that easily weighed as much as I did dangling from one hand.
 The shards of pottery strewn about the grotto answered any questions I might have had regarding its imminent fate.

Although conditions vary from country to country, the crisis impacts most heavily on the unskilled, young people, urban poor, ethnic minorities and older workers.
 Specific programmes to effect structural changes will have to be introduced in order to ensure a fair opportunity to all, especially minority youth, to lead economically active lives.
 It is in this context that the European Union, the United States and other Western governments have been considering ambitious proposals for addressing this issue.
 The Australian government has unveiled a $4.6 billion jobs package to reduce unemployment from 10 per cent to 5 per cent by the end of the decade by encouraging training for the young, the unskilled and the long-term unemployed.
 Recently the OECD has presented the main planks of an employment strategy to stimulate economic growth in the industrial nations, make labour markets more flexible, increase productivity, and revamp employment and unemployment security provisions.
 The relative success of the US economy in creating jobs during the past decade has prompted other countries to emphasize the importance of policies to increase the flexibility of wage rates and bring down the price of labour by reductions in the statutory minimum wage.
 The main effect of this policy is likely to be a movement of jobs between nations, however, not a significant increase in the total number of jobs available.
 In fact, measures which reduce wage incomes could have the perverse effect of reducing aggregate purchasing power and employment.
 Economic growth is recognized as an essential, though not sufficient, condition for higher rates of job growth – but fears of inflation constrain industrial countries from trying to stimulate faster expansion of their economies.
 The primary impact of moderate levels of inflation would be to encourage an outflow of investment to more stable currencies.

But to have a relationship with Jesus and fail to adore him seems all wrong.
 Evil, maybe.
 After all, I adored Eric Curtis.
 A Trip
 I drive a lot, across the desert to visit my kids and grandson in Tucson, and all over the West and sometimes farther on vacations and book promotion tours.
 One reason I drive rather than fly is, I come closest to adoring God while on the road.
 Between cities, I plug in my I-pod.
 What goes in comes out.
 If I listen to a love song, these days I’ll probably wish for a loving companion.
 If I turn on a radio talk show, I usually want to argue.

But as I gazed at the woman in my reflection, I could not reconcile the two.
 The dark silhouette, her figure emphasized by fitted clothes, black cape draped behind her—this woman was breathtaking.
 I moved closer to examine her, nearly reaching out to touch the windblown sable hair.
 Her eyes—my eyes—were dark.
 That muddy fog was gone now and under my black lashes waited deep emerald jewels, flecked with the darkest of browns.
 Chevelle had been right, this did suit me.
 The image in the mirror was stunning.
 It felt odd to marvel over my own reflection, but I couldn’t pretend I didn’t like it.
 The changes were still unnerving though, and I tried to remember what I looked like in my oldest memories, to see before, to see my mother’s face.
 The door opened behind me.

This was not a normal lion such as those found in the nearby forest, but a giant beast.
 Ravenhurr had been lucky indeed.
 He had been able to buy several Dire Cats from the Immortalist Guild dealer Taiga.
 With magic, he caused them to go into heat.
 It was known to be very difficult to affect Dire beasts with magic, and his success had shown his power and accomplishment as a mage.
 Rodregas had regretted not being on duty when the Dire Cats were staked out on the roof.
 Rodregas had heard from the other guards that the cats were in heat, and as Ravenhurr had hoped, a Celestial Lion had sensed their presence while the lion was out during the full moon with the Wilde Hunt, and the great lion had spent the last few nights doing his best to impregnate both of the female beasts.
 The whole keep could hear the wild rutting going on.
 Ravenhurr then had goats released on the roof and the Celestial Lion had gorged himself on them when he had finished rutting.
 The well-satisfied beast lay limp, sleeping, confident in his celestial power, and oblivious to his surroundings.

 She jumped up to kiss his cheek again.
 Marie couldn't sleep that night.
 She was going to Hollywood!
 She wouldn't be able to see Mary Pickford or Douglas Fairbanks, but maybe she'd see some of her new favorites, like Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts.
 She managed to doze a little but was wide awake before dawn.
 Deciding to do an aerobics tape until it was light enough to walk in the garden, she put on her workout clothes and went downstairs.
 She didn't know how she was going to be able to wait two entire days.
 She was so excited that she felt like she could run all the way to Hollywood.

The guard captain glanced at the edict from the king he carried in his hand.
 A rash impulse filled him, an insane desire to tear the paper to shreds and return to his liege bearing a lie on his lips.
 Under normal circumstances the king would know no difference.
 His advisors, however, were many, and every one of them would betray Antonil for the chance to gain esteem in the eyes of the king.
 No, he would have to deliver the message, regardless of his desires.
 He sighed one final time, turned toward his army, and began the march.

She shook her head, still unable to understand how having her finger in his mouth could make her entire body throb and burn.
 Needing to push the feeling away, she rose and started to clear the table.
 "Don't."

 "We're not going to spend our last hours together doing dishes."
 She swallowed, running her hands over his t-shirt.
 "I wish I had something from 1927 to give you."
 He stroked her hair.
 "You could leave your dress and go back in your bathing suit."
 She smiled.

Every new technology that automates a process or increases worker productivity has been perceived as a threat to the future of work.
 The reality has proved to be quite different.
 Technological development propels a spiral of economic development that creates many more jobs than it destroys.
 The most striking testimony to this fact is the history of employment in USA, arguably the country that has most readily and fully adopted new technologies over the past century.
 Employment in manufacturing and mining grew to a peak of about 40 per cent of the workforce after World War II before beginning its downward spiral to 15 per cent by 2000, about the same proportion as in 1850.
 Yet, during this same period total employment in America has expanded phenomenally, from a mere 13 million workers in 1870 to 68 million in 1955 and more than 136 million in 2002.
 In spite of all the automation and all the export of jobs to lower wage economies, the percentage of the American population employed has continued to rise over time.
 Several factors are responsible for this result, among which population growth and technological development are most prominent.
 Rising levels of technological sophistication certainly displace workers in most fields of manufacturing.
 But at the same time they stimulate growth of employment in many different ways – increasing demand for the products thus manufactured by a factor of 10, 100 or even 1000 fold as in the case of automobiles, TVs, cell phones and computers; increasing the demand for research workers to support technological innovation and for teachers to meet the rising demand for education; and rising living standards, which increases consumption of other goods and services due to the falling prices made possible by rising productivity.

 She did, marveling at the beauty of perfectly clear blue skies above and white powder puffs below.
 The clouds looked so soft and fluffy that she wished she could bounce on them.
 The trip was exciting.
 The flight attendant brought them peanuts and Coke, and Rick bought them headphones so that they could watch a movie.
 And then she brought them dinner!

 At the airport they got their luggage and rented a car.

It tasted like mushrooms and ginger ale.
 And its musk stayed on me for days, like it had gone subcutaneous, like it had replaced my own body odor.” Perhaps this was her hex: Ruthah: The perfume of Immortality.
 Others talk about the size and welcoming essence of Lorelei’s breasts.
 Buddy was mothered; he fed there like a suckling, like a child.
 It wasn’t love but it was something between the sacred and the profane.
 Some say Lorelei was responsible for the beginning of the slide downward for Buddy, filling his head with ideas of stardom, of leaving the backwash of Memphis and making it in a real town like L.A. or Boston.
 Buddy listened to Lorelei, we know that, for better or worse.
 Let’s hearken back to a happier image.
 A small recording studio.
 A three-piece band, occasionally four when Jim Dickinson stops by and plays a little keyboards.

“Velixar,” Harruq said, clutching Aurelia’s hands and sighing with a mixture of relief and terror.
 “He’s dead.
 I’m free.”
 Aurelia kissed his forehead as the half-orc drifted back to sleep, still overcome with his exhaustion.
 To her eyes, it seemed he slept far better than he had before.

 Qurrah did not know what to say or do as he watched his master die.
 His entire world had just come crashing down in the darkness.
 Above him were more than fifty elves, each one eager to bury an arrow in his back.

The thought made me flush.
 I was staring into someone’s eyes.
 But as quickly as I had come upon him, he was gone.
 He turned from me without a word and disappeared in a few long strides.
 I watched him go.
 Short dark hair, dark eyes, and a large, strong build.
 He certainly wasn’t from this clan.
 Junnie cleared her throat.
 “Freya?” I hadn’t realized she was watching me from the open door.
 I flushed again.

I can tell it in your voice."
 His shrug would've been imperceptible except for the fact his arms were still wrapped around me.
 "I do.
 I don't really remember him, but I've read through his journals dozens of times.
 It seems crazy to miss what you never knew, but there are days when I really wish he were still around to give me advice.
 I think that's what I missed the most.
 That and his stories."
 I smiled.
 "That sounds nice.
 We never got stories at my house.

Isaac's smile somehow completed his face.
 Funny how I'd never thought there was anything wrong with it before, but after finally being rewarded with something more than his normal, serious countenance, I had the first hint why he was one of Rachel's favorites among the pack.
 "It's likely I'll be exceedingly sore for the next few days, and my ego, such as it is, will likely take quite the beating, but our Kir'shan, our Alpha as you would say, isn't a bad sort."
 That was a relief.
 It also meant I knew exactly what I was going to do when I saw Alec next.
 Half an hour later, I was following him down the hall towards Physics and wishing I'd had more time to prepare.
 Alec slowed as we finally arrived outside the door to Mrs. Alexander's classroom.
 I carefully craned my head around him, half expecting to see Brandon's entire pack waiting to ambush us.
 Instead the pause seemed to have been caused by the fact Mrs. Alexander had been replaced by a sub.
 "Do you mind if we don't go to Physics today?"

BG:  	That’s caca, isn’t it?
 I mean, c’mon.
 Have you read “The Waste Land?”  Jesus.
 You know, I love “Day in the Life.”  Shit.
 It doesn’t get much better than that, pop music-wise.
 “I read the news today oh boy” is just about the finest first line I’ve ever heard.
 I’d kill to have written that one line.
 But, does it compare to “April is the cruelest month?” Or “Turning and turning in the widening gyre?”  Or even, “Something there is that does not love a wall?”  No, of course not.
 And John would tell you the same thing.
 I’m not putting down The Beatles, hell, McCartney and Lennon are the greatest songwriting team of all time.

I pushed the book into my pack and finally slept.
 When I woke, I felt better.
 Stronger.
 I was hopeful this applied to my magic as well.
 Chevelle sat against the dark stone wall, watching me.
 He seemed to recognize the change in my mood.
 “Feeling well?” I nodded.
 “I think I’d like to train again.” “That is probably a good idea.
 We’ll be leaving soon.” I didn’t know if I was that much better.
 “Don’t worry.

Rachel was shaking, and the blonde looked like someone about to pull the wings off a butterfly.
 I could feel my heartbeat climbing, slamming away at my ribs with all the energy of a full-blown panic attack, but I wasn't dizzy, just scared.
 The cafeteria workers had all turned around so their backs were facing us, a sight which kindled the first spark of anger, an emotion that burned brighter because of the fear still coursing through me.
 There was a gasp as Cassie shoved Rachel, a misleadingly casual motion that sent the smaller girl stumbling back into Alec's chest hard enough to leave bruises.
 The typical catcalls were still absent, it was as if nobody viewed this as a normal fight, like there was somehow more at stake.
 I'd been waiting for someone to intervene on Rachel's behalf.
 It was obvious she knew nothing about fighting.
 Cassie wasn't the kind of girl to fight just to prove a point and then forget about the incident afterwards.
 Just looking at her, I knew she'd remember any slight for as long as she lived, and she had enough influence in the school to make just about anyone's life miserable.
 She probably got away with things just because nobody was willing to cross her.

She hugged her knees, tears flowing down her cheeks.
 She knew without a doubt now that she would have.
 If she could have said good-bye to her family, let them know that she was safe and happy, she would have stayed with Rick.

He simply focused on the rightness of Doi’van’s words.
 Trying to attack an armed keep probably had far worse odds, and for what?
 So that they could steal horses; so that they could better their odds to escape a future fight?
 Here, if they succeeded, the three would not be stealing horses, they would be freeing people from slavery.
 Rodregas looked into Doi’van’s eyes.
 He was resolute.
 Rodregas felt humbled at the man’s bravery, at his passion, at his strength.
 Rodregas knew there was no such thing as a hero,  simply people that sometimes choose to do the right thing when it was a hard choice.
 There was no question for Doi’van, he simply stood quiet and ready.
 He knew what the right thing was, and he therefore took the right action.

Sorry I missed you last night.
 Found a really promising spot.
 Left early--looked like it might work if I was there at sunrise.
 --Mom I wasn't sure what to think.
 In theory she might be working on stuff for the brochure, but somehow I knew she was busy chasing her dreams once again.
 Good luck, I'll see you later.
 --A.
 My backpack creaked and groaned as I picked it up.
 Luckily most of my classes weren't moving as fast as I'd expected.
 I was far enough ahead I could start picking a few subjects and working on them every night instead of bringing home my entire locker every day.

Her name was Kris.
 She would go with me, she said, if not for a babysitting job she had that night.
 After she left, I drank more beer.
 Then I drove to a Jack in the Box on the coast road and found Kris there, in a Ford, hanging onto my cousin Jill’s boyfriend, Jimmy Dixon.
 Jimmy was one tough fellow.
 According to rumor, while fighting in the Golden Glove tournament, he had knocked another light-heavyweight into a coma.
 An equally tough surfer, Butch Van Artsdalen, rode shotgun.
 I strode to their car, jammed my head through rolled-down shotgun side window and stared at Kris.
 “You babysitting these guys?” “It didn’t work out,” she said.
 Butch grabbed the door handle, but Jimmy told him to be cool, and he motioned me around to his side of the car.

But I did know she had it.
 Maybe I’ll be able to steal it… Lost in thought, I began to fall behind the group.
 The higher we rose up the mountain, the more treacherous the jagged rock became.
 I felt every step, holding tight as the horse’s hooves slipped and jumped.
 The haze thickened, keeping the view both ahead and behind close.
 It gathered in my hair, leaving it a matted mess with the single braid—Ruby’s handiwork—dripping condensation over the shoulder of my cloak.
 I decided to practice as we rode, closing my eyes to sink partially into my horse, still alert to my own self and the outside world.
 It was there, leading my horse and seeing through his eyes, that the pain struck.
 It came on instantaneously, hitting me like a blade, cutting, shearing.
 It was accompanied by sharpness of sound as well.

I would probably be extremely stiff and sore tomorrow morning, but I was used to that feeling.
 We began to walk back towards the park when Jason stopped us.
 “Hey can Seth and I catch you guys later?
 We have something to do.” Jason grabbed Seth and they took off.
 Emily raised an eyebrow, “Should we be concerned?” “Nah they’re boys, let them do what they have to do,” I said with a quick sigh.
 While we were walking the boys appeared in front of us, holding something behind their backs.
 They seemed to be fighting giggles which usually meant they were hiding something.
 Or they were about to do something that fell under their category of “funny”.
 “Hi guys,” Seth said still fighting a smirk.
 “Hi,” I replied cautiously.

"Boys.
 You're all the same.
 Okay.
 Assuming my mom takes off for the night, I'll go, but only on the condition that you behave."
 I managed to make it to the door without my knees knocking together, but it was a close thing.
 I'd been scared sick when he'd been about to kiss me, but it had at least been something I'd been dreaming about off and on for years.
 I wasn't sure I was ready for the other things he was starting to imply.
 Chapter 20 There were a couple of times between Monday and the end of the week where I didn't think I was going to survive having to worry about whether or not I'd be able to sneak out to Brandon's party.
 My dreams had taken a decidedly odd turn.
 I'd had the lucid, vivid dreams every single night, but my guilty conscience seemed to be working overtime.

Typically, youth comprise 65 to 75 per cent of the total unemployed.
 With the region’s population still growing at 3 per cent annually, these countries need to create 100 million new jobs in the coming decade just to maintain their present levels of unemployment.
 High population growth and a severe economic slowdown have generated high rates of unemployment in the Arab countries, estimated to exceed 25 per cent during the early 1990s, in spite of the very low labour participation rates among women in this region.
 In the aftermath of the Gulf crisis, labour-supplying countries such as Jordan, Lebanon, the Sudan and Syria have suffered the most.
 Returnees swelled Jordan’s population by 8.4 per cent and caused unemployment levels to rise above 20 per cent.
 Unemployment levels among Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank are among the highest in the world.
 A dramatic exception to this gloomy trend comes from the countries of Asia and the Pacific, which have made great strides in job generation during the 1980s and are poised to continue expanding rapidly.
 The Newly Industrializing Economies (NIEs) – Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan-China – are all facing severe labour shortages, with Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia also moving in that direction.
 But other Asian countries continue to face major challenges in creating sufficient jobs for all.
 China has created a phenomenal 100 million new jobs since 1985 and continues to grow rapidly, but the country still has a pool of 130 million surplus rural workers.

Only I don't understand, Mr. Peters told me I had the job."
 I'd pretty much forgotten about the tourism brochure for the city.
 It'd sounded like the perfect job for Mom, albeit a short term one.
 Now it was sounding like it'd been too good to be true.
 The move had been something I'd opposed and then ignored when my opposition hadn't made any difference.
 I didn't know anything about grown-up things like mortgages.
 I'd been too self-absorbed to learn.
 For the first time I felt guilty about making things harder for Mom.
 Surely there was something I could have done to help out, even considering the attacks.

“Kill me, if you will, but do not bore me with your chatter.
 I have suffered beyond anything you can do to me.”
 A firestorm of anger overwhelmed the elf’s features.
 He stepped back and drew an arrow.
 Qurrah lashed his whip, but his speed was not enough.
 An arrow tore right through his hand.
 The whip fell, the fire vanishing the second it left contact with Qurrah’s skin.
 A second arrow followed.
 The half-orc rocked backward, his brown eyes wide in shock, as the tip pierced deep into his throat.
 The healing potion fell from his hands and broke against a rock.

 And all those small bodies he left for his brother to mutilate?

 Every action, every kill, seemed to confirm the words of his brother.
 He was a killer and nothing more.
 His legacy would be one of death and emptiness.
 The ghosts of the village clung to his back and neck.
 His choice was made.
 When he looked to the stars, he saw Aurelia’s face among them.

Whatever she was about to say was preempted as we were both thrown forward in our seats.
 James slid the car through a one-eighty turn that left us facing the direction we'd just come from, only a couple of feet from the start of our lane.
 "You're not making her walk!"
 It was obvious that whatever magical ability had allowed Rachel to face down the larger boy wasn't working anymore.
 He looked like he was set for a monster fight.
 "I'm not washing my car again."
 I expected Rachel to back down as soon as she realized he was spoiling for a fight, but if anything she looked more determined.
 It was hard to believe this was the same person I'd had to rescue from Cassie so recently.
 I stopped Rachel just before she could put the impressive lungful of air she'd just taken in to whatever use she'd planned.

 Every single person here will vouch for Brandon."
 A couple of people flinched a little at that, like they weren't completely comfortable lying, but Cassie stared them down.
 Nobody would meet my gaze.
 I opened my mouth to protest, and Cassie grabbed me by the front of my jacket and dragged me the better part of twenty feet.
 My head was still spinning as she leaned down and hissed into my ear.
 "Get out of here.
 Don't wait around, don't ask anyone for a ride.

The little girl clutched a doll in her hands.
 Harruq paused, and deep in his heart, some piece of him shrieked in protest.
 “I’m sorry,” he said.
 Salvation and Condemnation quivered in his hands.
 “There’s no room for compassion.
 Not here.
 Not tonight.”
 He left the house, blood covering his blades.
 He let out a primal cry to the stars, whether of anguish or elation, he did not know.

He looked like a god among men, and the way the soldiers fell at his feet made him think he might have been one.
 This red-dream self looked straight at him and spoke, but Harruq could not understand the words.
 The sound of his own voice chilled him, though, for it was dark, it was dangerous, and it was exactly like Velixar’s.
 _A god among men,_ said a second voice, one he had never heard before.
 It was darker than any shade that haunted his nightmares.
 There was only one it could be, and it was no mortal.
 _Protect your brother, and I will grant you a kingdom.
 Live as you have always lived, and I will reward you with eternity.
 Kill, as I desire you to kill, and you will find a peace unknown to the mortal realm.
 The time for questioning is over.

I wondered what Igneeria would be like.
 Maybe the place would be pretty decent… “Jazell?” Emily’s voice scattered my thoughts and I opened my eyes to see her walking briskly towards me.
 She too had an empty bag slung over her shoulder.
 She dropped her bag next to mine and leaned against the statue.
 Nobody spoke for awhile.
 Finally Emily opened her mouth and said, “What are you thinking about?” “What?” The question had caught me by complete surprise.
 “What are you thinking about?” she repeated.
 “Surely you must be thinking something; we’re going to some ‘other world’!” I closed my eyes.
 “I was just wondering what it would be like in Igneeria.
 What about you?” “Well,” she said thoughtfully, “I was thinking about Kojas-” “Emily don’t say his name, I don’t feel like being yelled at again.” I interrupted her.

“Don’t try to understand or you’ll get lost in the complicated labyrinths that are their brains.” “I think this is the most thinking the two have ever done,” Emily said with a sigh and shook her head, making her pink curls dance.
 “It’s just sad.” I was about to say something else when the dwarf gave a loud cough.
 Jason and Seth fell silent, outlined by the eerie glow of the arch.
 “You must know a few things before you enter,” the dwarf said, pacing back and forth.
 He reminded me of a teacher instructing a class.
 “First of all, once you enter, there is a chance that you won’t be able to leave for a while.” My heart fell at this.
 “Second, Igneeria is wild and offers little protection.
 Especially at a time like this.” He gave us a hard stare.
 “You might get seriously injured, or you might almost die.
 You must be ready for this.” I felt my stomach do sick flip-flops.

Eric in his way, Olga in hers.
 Jesus in his.
 That I can’t see my best friends as clearly anymore tends to sadden me.
 But even the sadness contains beauty.
 Because as I lose them, my adoration turns toward what I have come to see better, which is Jesus.
 Who is God.
 Revising
 While I’m writing all this from notes and memory, I decide to pick up my old hardback of Big Sur.
 I still get moved by Jack Kerouac’s honesty and his pictures of the raw and terrifying beauty of people and things.
 After reading about a drive from Big Sur into Monterrey, I go online and look up pictures of the two real people (to whom the book gives other names) on that drive, Kerouac and Neal Cassady.

 Her tears began coming faster.
 He tried to draw her closer, but she stiffened and then stood up.
 “Where-where are those books about time travel?” she asked, wiping her eyes.
 “In my office.” “I want to look at them again to see if I can find something that we missed.” “OK—I’ll help you.” “No.”  She shook her head, glancing at him but unable to meet his gaze.
 “I-I need to do it alone, OK?” “OK.” He watched her go, his heart heavy.
 He couldn’t stand to see her so unhappy, but he didn’t want her to leave.

As long as there isn't any kind of public fight with massive amounts of bloodshed, I probably wouldn't know that everyone is at each other's throats, but Donovan seems happy.
 He's always pleasant."
 The expression on Mallory's face tugged on my heartstrings.
 The open vulnerability there made me cast about for additional tidbits to tell her.
 "He's one of my favorites.
 Rachel and I were already friends, so it made sense that she'd be nice to me, and Dominic at least knew who I was, but Donovan was nice to me right from the start.
 It's almost like he approves of me where some of the others aren't so sure Alec's dating me is a very good idea."
 Mallory's expression was far away as she spoke.
 "Yes, he would approve of the two of you.
 He's the consummate man servant, so very professional that you probably wouldn't ever know it if he didn't like you, but I'm sure he does.

“Seth, look!” I said and pointed to it.
 He came over and bent down, tracing the sign with his finger.
 I waited and finally said, “Well, do you know what it is?” Seth dropped his finger.
 “It means, 'slayer of worlds'.
 Does that ring a bell?” “How do you know that?” I asked.
 He shrugged.
 “I don't know how, I just do.
 Maybe that's my power.” “Well, I want to go this way,” I said and pointed to the entrance.
 “If something like that is on the entrance, I want to know where this goes.” “I agree but aren't we supposed to be trying to find Emily and Jason?” “I have an idea,” I said and pulled my bow off my back.
 I removed one of my arrows and put my bow on the ground.

Emily and I sat on the floor, eating pizza and doodling nonsense in her notebook.
 The time ticked by to one o’clock in the morning.
 We sat side by side on her bed near the window, and I played with the fridge on the edge of one of her pillows.
 I looked down at Emily’s pajamas, which were covered in sun-tanning penguins.
 Typical Emily.
 “Nice PJs Emily.” I chuckled.
 She stuck her tongue out, “What do you have against sun-tanning penguins?” “Nothing!” I smiled to myself.
 I shouldn’t be talking; I was wearing pajamas covered in little pigs.
 Emily leaned back to turn off her desk light.
 It clicked off and I gazed outside one more time before turning around to go to bed.

Maybe it was a dream.
 Or a premonition.
 Or, for all I know, I might have briefly died.
 The spell broke and left me sprawled in the Desert Inn.
 I lay still a while, sore all over, with a throbbing skull, wishing to go back to heaven.
 Then I got up, swallowed a few aspirin, and roused Eric to tell him about my adventure.
 “I was on one side of a bottomless gorge, looking across at this forest of evergreens and fruit trees, with all the colors so bright they looked lighted from inside.
 The forest was on an endless slope.
 There wasn’t any horizon.
 And the music, each note contained all kinds of harmonies, all at once.

Art – Well, I must say I love that painting of Jesus and Elvis shaking hands, and the one next to it of them fighting the Ninjas.
 It looks so lifelike, and it is extremely unique in concept.
 For the rest, I’m not art-minded enough to tell you anything special.
 Liz – That doesn’t matter, just tell me what appeals to you.
 Art – I haven’t seen it all yet.
 The other piece that really sticks out in my mind is that one about Gene.
 Wonderful imagery, and you got his hair perfect.
 Maybe I can give you more after I get a better look at it all.
 But first I need to speak with my son.
 Important issues involving the family, some not for your ears though as close you may be.

Jason spun around and began to stab them as I suggested.
 He ducked and I say their number start to drop because of his quick reflexes.
 The swarm's size was reduced to half.
 The syphons were starting to look uneasy, hesitating before they flung themselves at us.
 It didn't matter to me.
 “Retreat!” one of the voices yelled.
 “Fall back!” They gave one more angry hiss at us and disappeared into the woods.
 The bushes and trees rattled and then the woods were silent.
 I could hear everyone's heavy breaths as we turned to face each other.
 Well, actually everyone turned to me.

Nobody we'd known back in Minnesota could've strong-armed both the president of a bank and the mayor.
 Especially not from all the way back there.
 It had to be someone local, and they had to be either rich, powerful, or both.
 The answer was so obvious I felt like an idiot for not realizing who it was from the start.
 Who had I been told, almost from my first day here, were the two most influential families in Sanctuary?
 The Worthingfields and the Graveses.
 Both of which had at least one member of the family my age, one of whom seemed to hate me profoundly.
 What was it the mayor had said?
 "I can't promise he'll even read it."
 It was a he who'd intervened on our behalf, and Rachel and Alec's father had died years ago, while Brandon's father...actually I knew next to nothing about Brandon's parents.

Nothing.
 I reached out to move a rock from the floor.
 It didn’t budge.
 I concentrated on a pebble beside me.
 It didn’t shift in the least.
 “Ruby?
 It doesn’t work.” I held my hands in front of me, helpless.
 Panic was taking me when she laid a hand on my shoulder and leaned forward.
 I expected her to calm me, explain it would come back, it would all be okay.
 Glitter was in the air before I could stop her.

It'd seemed impossible, but as Mrs. Alexander had gently herded me onto the bus, there'd still been no sign of her.
 "Maybe she's driving instead of taking the bus down.
 I seem to remember someone saying her brother had purchased a ticket.
 He isn't here, so possibly they're going down together."
 It'd been a fairly slender thread upon which to hang my hopes.
 Somehow my dream of seeing Les Misérables had morphed into a dream of seeing Les Misérables with Rachel.
 We still didn't get to spend much time together, but she was rapidly becoming the only person I could confide in besides Brandon.
 A boyfriend, or near-boyfriend, was nice, but some things just needed to be shared with another female.
 I couldn't tell my mom about my feelings for Brandon or she'd absolutely freak.
 After spending so much time lying to her about the origin of the almost four dozen roses, I couldn't afford any kind of slip in that regard.

 BG:  	No, the TV evangelist.
 Of course, the bluesman.
 The bluesman’s bluesman.
 Never recorded one single song, never traveled outside the Mid-South, yet his influence is everywhere, is legendary.

Steve was tasked with introducing undercover officers into the inner circle that would eventually lead to a bust that appeared to be far removed from the original contact with Steve.
 The only problem with Steve is that he was double-crossing the narcotics officers and they had come to discover his deception.
 Steve and his girlfriend, Ashley were highly addicted to Oxy and their combined drug habit made it necessary for him to continue to deal Oxy to the bigger buyers while tossing a few small fish to the officers to appease them and satisfy his deal.
 The officers knew too that Steve was beating his girlfriend and forcing her to perform “happy ending massages” and sexual favors to support her personal addiction to Oxy.
 Brandon was one of the small fish that Steve provided information on.
 Brandon had become so addicted that he could no longer supply the drug in quantity because he and Tiffanie consumed over $1000 a day by snorting or smoking it.
 Brandon had gone from a large dealer to a junkie who would do anything, say anything and sell anything to get his next fix.
 Brandon had become dispensable to Steve and the other large dealers, as he was now an Oxy addicted con man in constant search of his next dose of this potent drug.
 Brandon could trade prison for setting up the double-crosser Steve.
 Officer White was insistent that the time frame for this deal was short.

Art – All people need is love and happiness.
 That’s it.
 Some happiness you can find on your own, without love.
 Some of the best kind of happiness comes from love.
 Not the distant love of a remote God, but a personal love.
 Love of other people, or love of life.
 How ever you find Love doesn’t matter, because happiness comes with it.
 You don’t need faith in God to find either.
 Ned – What a sad life you live, I hope you one day overcome your confusion, and you finally see the light.
 I will pray for your soul.

Things weren't ideal; I'd never met a group with so many inside jokes.
 Half the time I felt like there was an entire conversation being carried on over my head, but sitting next to Brandon left me with such a tingly feeling all along my right side that I didn't really mind.
 Not even the presence of a pop quiz in History managed to faze me.
 Almost before I knew it I was sitting down in Physics.
 As usual, Alec slipped into class a half second before the bell.
 I was so happy I forgot how arrogant he was, and I smiled at him as he sat down.
 It was like he was looking at something that wasn't even human.
 My insides seemed to freeze and shrink.
 I couldn't even muster up my normal blush of embarrassment.
 I'd had plenty of people hate me since I'd arrived in Sanctuary, but he was the first person I'd met who I was convinced wouldn't have thrown me a life preserver if I was drowning.

Emily made a face at him.
 “Wow, thanks so much for the support, Jason.
 That speech was incredible.” Jason stuck his tongue out.
 “You're welcome.” “One day,” she mumbled.
 “One darn day...” “Emily, are you okay?” I asked.
 Her head shot up and she gave me a big smile.
 “Yup, never better.
 I'm just having a minute to myself.” “Okay...” I trailed off.
 Seth walked over to join us.
 “We should get moving and find somewhere else to stay.

I suffered through the last hour of school and then hurried to my locker.
 I didn't really want to meet up with Britney, but I also didn't want to alienate her any more than I already had.
 I shouldn't have even bothered.
 I waited around for a full fifteen minutes before finally heading over to the tutoring lab.
 Britney was watching the door when I arrived.
 She didn't even bother trying to mask the flash of satisfaction that crossed her face when I walked in late, obviously having spent the last little while waiting for her.
 I wanted to scream, or maybe cry.
 It was amazing how quickly a perfect day could go down the tubes.
 I turned towards my normal table, and Rachel caught my eye.
 Sitting in a pool of light from one of the overhead skylights, she looked like Britney's antithesis.

"Don't worry about it.
 I'm just glad it was that easy.
 I've been worried all day someone would stump me on something right out of the gate on my first day."
 Rachel looked up at me through dark lashes as I stood.
 "I've wanted to say thanks for a while.
 I really appreciate you making Cassie back down yesterday.
 Nobody else has ever stood up for me like that.
 At least not people that I didn't already know."
 Based on what I'd seen less than thirty hours ago, it didn't look like her friends stood up for her either.
 "No worries, it just seemed like the thing to do at the time.

“Dear Celestials in the heavens, we open our hearts to you and we accept our duties as your warriors here in the world.
 Let your courage fill our hearts and your strength fill our arms.
 May we know the guidance of your twin children, Honor and Justice.” He then knelt down and pulled one of the two short swords from his weapon harness; he crossed his arms and laid the blade across his own upper arms.
 It was possible, only with great concentration to do this without dropping the sword or cutting himself.
 His instructor had taught the squires this simple prayer.
 It guaranteed that the squires stayed focused during meditation.
 Doi’van and Imeralda looked at him as he knelt in the grass with the sword naked on his bare arms.
 Rodregas spoke carefully so as not to tip the sword and said, “It is called sword meditation.
 My instructor would start us out with the prayer and then we would meditative on our duty.” “For how long?” asked Imeralda.
 “Until you are sure of what your duty is,” Rodregas replied, hearing the voice of his old drill Knight Captain.

Ruby laughed and it made my hair stand on end.
 No, I’d stay.
 She might be our host now but I’d get my chance.
 I’d fix her.
 She shifted and the markings on her leg caught my attention.
 A thin painted vine trailed up to her thigh.
 She noticed me looking.
 “Well, Frey, I feel like I know so much about you.” She smiled slyly at Chevelle.
 “But you know so little of me.
 Let me tell you a few things, since we will be traveling together.” I felt my head jerk to find Chevelle, not believing what I had just heard.

The half-orc shrugged, drew his swords, and began walking.
 A sleek staircase led to the upper floor, while through the hallway they could see a room with an iron stove and shelves for storing food.
 “Which way do we go?” Harruq asked.
 “Up,” Qurrah said.
 “And quiet, before you wake him.”
 “Too late,” said a voice from the stairs.
 Both turned to see Ahrqur standing at the top step, his arms crossed.
 He was dressed in a long green robe.
 Silver swirls marked the sleeves and front.
 Brown hair fell far past his shoulders.

In truth he did not know how good or bad their odds were.
 He knew they were not good, but his mind did not spin with the odds.
 He simply focused on the rightness of Doi’van’s words.
 Trying to attack an armed keep probably had far worse odds, and for what?
 So that they could steal horses; so that they could better their odds to escape a future fight?
 Here, if they succeeded, the three would not be stealing horses, they would be freeing people from slavery.
 Rodregas looked into Doi’van’s eyes.
 He was resolute.
 Rodregas felt humbled at the man’s bravery, at his passion, at his strength.
 Rodregas knew there was no such thing as a hero,  simply people that sometimes choose to do the right thing when it was a hard choice.

“Thank you, my master,” whispered the half-orc.
 “I have never felt more honored.”
 Velixar placed a hand atop Qurrah’s head and accepted the tears he knew the half-orc tried to hide.
 He had long thought the weaker emotions fled from his soul, but that night he felt an overwhelming sense of pride.
 “Harruq,” Velixar said, his normally unshakable voice faltering.
 “Escort your brother home.
 Protect him, even unto death.
 He will usher in a new age to this world.
 Of this I have no doubt.” He shouted an order to Qurrah’s undead.
 The eight obeyed, marching out of town to join the rest of Velixar’s army.

"Your paintings.
 That explains them.
 You were superimposing what you see over top of what someone like me would see.
 Only how would you know what things look like to us?"
 Alec's chuckle held more than a little resignation in its timbre.
 "You are amazing.
 Anyone else waking up in a strange place would've run away as soon as they regained consciousness.
 At the very least, you should have started screaming.
 Instead you wander around, take in some rather feeble attempts at art, and then sneak out without saying a word."
 Secure in the knowledge he could see me, I stuck my tongue out at him.

There is no need for you to use deceptions or exaggerations.
 You die today either way, so speak the truth and it will be a less interesting death.” Rodregas was furious at himself to be this close to gaining a greater sigil and having achieved knighthood, and then to be caught in a hallway this close to the chamber.
 That, of course, was life.
 There were no simple victories.
 “What do you want to know?” Rodregas asked.
 “An Immortalist sorcerer died recently and then this summer someone ambushed a caravan with fresh stock for the Menagerie.
 I believe these two events are connected, and I even think you might be the connection,” Van’dret said.
 His words gaining an edge of anger at the end.
 Rodregas glanced at the other two.
 Doi’van met his inquiring look, but did not respond.

Brandon was smoking these pills at a heavy clip.
 He had started his habit by taking the pills orally, then snorting them; finally he had escalated to burning them on foil while inhaling the fumes through a stem pipe.
 Although the next step was slamming or injecting in his veins, he hadn’t gone that far.
 He was up to about thirty Oxy pills a day and couldn’t sell enough to supply his habit.
 While he had been living on less since his home lock-down, he was really never clean during this detox.
 How was Brandon going to achieve what these cops wanted in his condition and with his new reputation as a snitch?
 I am the father, with all that that means.
 I am the man of the family, and I would do anything to protect my family but I was in unchartered territory here once again.

“Or half-orc, whatever you are.
 I can only keep them like this for a little while.”
 Both men glared at Harruq as he stood, but while their mouths moved and their chests heaved neither produced a sound.
 The half-orc looked to the woman shrouded in the shadows cast by the fallen torch of the patrolmen.
 “I said move along,” she said.
 “I need to give these men a talking to.”
 “I’m going,” Harruq grumbled before staggering down the alley.
 He did not attempt either stealth or silence.
 Seething, he limped back to Qurrah and their home.
 Neither said a word as he discarded his armor, tossed his swords into a corner, and crashed onto their bed of straw.

What did they want?
 I made a mental note to tell Emily about this.
 That is, if all of us didn’t die first.
 They screeched in anger and I felt their eyes on me.
 Every single one was full of burning hatred.
 But I ignored the feeling and focused on Seth.
 His eyes locked on mine as he wheezed and he sent me a clear message, Help.
 Not that I needed his permission anyway, it's just Seth never asked for help.
 I, again, suddenly knew the syphon's weakness but I didn't know why or how.
 I could sense some dark black area on the neck just like a target dot.

Though I have never met the buyer, I have been assured by his girlfriend that he will have the money and the deal will take only a few minutes.
 I also know that Ashley is seriously addicted to Oxy.
 After we first met—at her apartment—she called me several times just to get a few pills to hold her over until we could meet for this drug deal.
 I have refused her every time as I have told her that we will meet just the one time and exchange all the drugs for the money at once.
 She has tried to entice me with her young body in exchange for a couple Oxy, but I have resisted the temptation.
 The first time Ashley and I met I had the pleasure of seeing her naked body, but my goal is not to see it again, my goal is to do this drug deal.
 Her actions highlight that she is seriously addicted and that is not comforting when I am taking her word that Steve is a trustworthy drug dealer, as if there is such a thing.
 Another car approaches and it is white, but I cannot tell the make of the vehicle.
 As it passes, I check it out and see that it is a woman with two small children.
 She is handing a baby bottle towards a car seat in the back.

Then whoever hands him his plate will take that place.
 Jim – I don’t think it will even last that long.
 Karen – Dinner is only a few minutes away.
 Jim – I know.
 I know.
 But it is Eugene.
 Karen – His attention span can’t be that short.
 Liz – It’s gotten better over the last few months.
 (Cleo approaches Eugene)
 Cleo – My my Eugene you are looking quite handsome today.

I waited through the morning and finally—around midday—I gave up and relaxed onto the ground, staring up at the sky.
 The earth beneath me was warm, the sun shining bright.
 I watched as a bird flew high overhead.
 It was gliding, slow and steady on the wind.
 As I shielded my eyes with a hand, I noticed the ink on my wrist and smiled.
 I suddenly knew the soaring creature above was a hawk.
 I closed my eyes and relaxed my arm at my side, imagining flying.
 I breathed deep and conjured the image it would see, looking down on us.
 The picture was sharp, even at this distance, but the colors weren’t as clear, and the outlying shapes not as defined.
 I laughed at myself for adding that detail to my daydream, imagining a bird seeing differently.

The officer and his sergeant left the room for about ten minutes before returning to tell me that it would.
 “We are not condoning or encouraging this in any way,” Officer White insisted.
 That was all I needed.
 Now Brandon and I would need to work out the rest.
 Chapter 17: A Father’s Devotion Brandon became my coach: In order to convincingly portray a drug supplier, I had to know the lingo.
 I had to know the system.
 I was miles from toot and half an ocean from weed.
 I would need Brandon to assist me with current drug terms.

More than 39 million house holds, representing 56 per cent of all urban households, have acquired them in the last fifteen years.
 Similarly, between 1981 and 1990 India’s production of televisions rose more than ten-fold from 450,000 per year to 4.8 million.
 Exposure to lifestyles elsewhere through the media, cinema and travel has created greater awareness of possibilities and generated higher hopes.
 The enormous recent achievements of East Asian countries, which are quickly closing the economic gap that separates them from the wealthiest nations, act as a constant reminder and goad to those who have achieved less.
 In the new atmosphere of peace and greater freedom brought about by the end of the Cold War, all these factors combine to add urgency and intensity to the aspirations of the lower and middle classes everywhere.
 Not long ago most people expected to end their lives in the same place and largely in the same position as they and their predecessors began.
 Growth was confined to the advancement of a small number of individuals, mostly within existing levels of the established social order.
 Development was a slow, haphazard and largely unconscious result of countless individual efforts.
 Today, people in most developing countries are motivated by an expectation, an urge, a feverish drive for rapid advancement that has acquired the characteristics of a social revolution.
 The search for greater comfort, convenience, security and enjoyment motivates entire societies to embrace progress as their primary goal and collectively dedicate themselves to achieve it.

I'm afraid mostly all I see is the flaws.

 "But not all?"
 "No, not all of them."
 It was getting harder and harder to string thoughts together in a comprehensible manner.
 "Sounds fulfilling.
 Busy, but fulfilling."
 Alec waited so long to respond that I nearly drifted off.
 "It's always seemed fulfilling.
 At least until recently."

 The smile was back, gentle and teasing.
 "Minds no, scents yes.
 The human body is quite marvelous in how many different systems it recruits to match its mood."
 The way Brandon had always known exactly the right thing to say at any given time suddenly made sense.
 Alec let me process his latest little tidbit of information, and then continued.

 The two half-orcs heard the sounding of the horn but did not know its purpose.
 So far from any human soldiers, they could only guess.
 “Maybe they’re rallying at the horn,” Harruq ventured.
 Qurrah shrugged, glancing down the vacant street in search of victims.
 “Perhaps, or perhaps the elves are retreating, or even the humans.
 Either way, our time is running short.
 We must find our master.
 So far no resident of Woodhaven has seen us and lived, but I do not wish to press such luck.”
 “Looks like we have no choice,” Harruq said, crossing his swords in an ‘X’ before his chest.

Not only that, I couldn't ever come up with anything good to say when someone teased me.
 Brandon seemed to sense my unease, and flashed another gentle smile.
 "I just wanted to find out if you had a way home tonight after you finished up with your math stuff."
 Britney was almost jumping up and down.
 "Oh, don't worry, Brandon, I'll give Adri a ride home.
 The poor thing lives all the way out in the Anderson home.
 I've been giving her a ride into school and home almost every day since she moved."
 Brandon was still smiling, but I got the feeling that it was a little more forced.
 "Perfect.
 I'm going to go take care of some stuff then, but I'll see you both tomorrow."

 “Of course,” Aurelia said, picking up her staff.

 Hours later, they finished and said their goodbyes.
 “See you tomorrow,” Harruq called, sheathing his blades.
 The elf did not reply as she vanished behind the trees.
 He stared after her for a bit, then turned toward home.
 Before he could take two steps, a sudden weight crashed into his side.
 He tumbled best he could, his shoulder absorbing much of the impact.

He’s about as evil as Mr. Rogers.
 And he spends way too much time in the Land of Make Believe talking to little hand puppets.
 Jim – Well, there was that one time where he threw those water balloons at Mr. Svinvali down the street.
 Liz – he didn’t get within 10 feet of the old man, and he was off and running before the single water balloon that he actually threw was halfway too his target.
 He’s a wimp, and a poor shot.
 He always runs out of courage before he achieves his goal of becoming ‘evil’.
 Jim – It was pretty funny when Mr Svinvali caught up with him.
 It’s a good thing that he didn’t tell Eugene’s father though, that was a relief, especially after the last time Gene’s dad found about one of his little adventures.
 Ah shit…
 Liz – …so that’s why Eugene was in the hospital for that entire week.

Maybe even better considering that he took the time to review some of the underlying theory we'd been taught in class.
 I'd just jumped right into the answer.
 "You're right.
 You never even came to class, and you got the right answer.
 Did you cheat?
 Is the answer to this problem out there somewhere on the Internet?"
 Alec's face tightened with something I was willing to bet was anger.
 "No, I didn't cheat.
 I did the research to find the answer, presumably just like you did.
 Next time you feel like insulting me, please suppress the urge."

Qurrah’s smile broadened as the man collapsed and died while still within his grasp.
 When he let go, the icy flesh hit the dirt hard enough to crack the arm at the shoulder.
 Blood poured out from the body but not the arm.
 “A marvelous spell,” the half-orc gasped, fighting away a momentary wave of dizziness.
 He closed his eyes and attuned his mind to the village.
 A stench of fear trailed west.
 Women and children, all of them panicked and confused.
 “Harruq, they flee west,” Qurrah whispered, magically enhancing his voice using a spell Velixar had taught him.
 His quiet words flooded the town, audible by all yet still sounding like a whisper.
 The fleeing residents of the town heard and were terrified.

It was time to test the spells his master had taught him.
 An elderly man came around the corner, a torch his only weapon.
 He glared at Qurrah with unabashed hatred.
 “ _Weakness_ ,” the necromancer hissed in the wispy tongue of magic.
 The old man dropped his torch and wobbled on his legs.
 His elderly arms, already shriveled, shrunk even more.
 Skin tightened against his frame, and in seconds it was if the man had become a living skeleton decorated with flesh, hair, and clothes.
 The man took a staggered step forward, still determined to fight Qurrah even as his arms struggled to bear their own weight.
 He let out a moan of unintelligible loathing.
 “You are not worth my time,” Qurrah told him.

The very highest social priority should be given to six educational goals in both developing and developed countries.
 First, there must be a massive effort to achieve UNESCO’s goal of eradicating illiteracy worldwide by the year 2000.
 The problem can only be banished by an all-out commitment of every national government to eliminate the huge backlog of illiteracy, while at the same time insuring that every child is taught to read and write.
 National youth service corps and military personnel can be utilized to help provide the necessary manpower.
 Second, every possible step must be taken to provide education for female children, an essential requirement for social equity and quality of life improvement.
 Nearly two-thirds of the world’s illiterate are women.
 In the poorest developing countries, literacy rates among females are 40 per cent below rates for males and the average number of years of schooling for females is 60 per cent lower.
 But perceptible progress has been made.
 Between 1980 and 1990, female primary school enrolment rose from 44 per cent to 47 per cent of total enrolment, although it actually declined in the Arab states and remained virtually unchanged in South Asia.
 Uneducated females represent a huge reservoir of untapped human potential that must be given every opportunity and full assistance to develop their innate capacities.

Nordien hit with such force that his arms and legs flew like a small doll’s.
 Rodregas fell on top of the armored form, grabbed the bottom of the helmet, and ripped it off.
 Unfortunately, it was firmly secured.
 When Rodregas ripped it off he took a good section of jaw with the helm.
 Rodregas then threw the helm aside and punched the man in the face, full strength, several times.
 His first hit smashed the front of Nordien’s face.
 The second blow shattered it.
 The third blow smashed the head to pulp.
 Rodregas probably should have picked up Nordien’s mace and shield, but he also knew that without plate armor, he could not afford a long drawn out series of pounding matches.
 Rodregas would fight like a lion instead.

I told her this because I needed to set some restrictive boundaries; I knew I would need to work within the confines of the narcotics officers, and this would allow me to put her off, buy some time, if I needed it.
 She talked with me and continued to massage my chest as she straddled my naked body.
 She reached for my hands and placed them on her young firm breasts.
 It was an unexpected treat for “an old guy with a script”.
 I’ll let you use your imagination from there, but she finished her massage and then we both got dressed.
 The fish was in the net.
 The girl, Ashley, had taken the bait, and I felt confident that I had the deal working.
 Now I would need to go home and hope my wife’s level of understanding would allow me to be completely honest with her about what I was doing, and what I had just done.
 I knew Lisa wanted to help Brandon and we both knew my involvement would require a venture into unchartered territory but I needed her to know everything.
 Lisa and I had been married for twenty-four years and we knew what lay ahead would be a bigger test of our commitment than what I had just done.

"I demand satisfaction on behalf of my pack for the two of our number that you brutally murdered.
 This is within my rights under the laws that bind us.
 I demand two lives for the two lives robbed me."
 Brandon's expression was confident and a little smug, and I somehow didn't doubt in the slightest that he'd expected Alec to calmly hand over two people to be executed.
 Alec hadn't even flinched at the demand.
 "Your wolves were lawbreakers who were executed before they could break further laws.
 The protection of the people, of the secrets that guard our nature from the dayborn, represents a law that supersedes any question of territory or dominance."
 The energy suddenly rolling off of the gathered shape shifters nearly drove me to my knees as Alec continued.
 "By their actions Adriana Paige learned of our nature, and it was only by the grace of the Maker that I was able to stop them from killing her.
 Their deaths were an unavoidable price to save an innocent."

A large tent is up over the gravesite and rows of chairs for the service.
 The massive flower arrangements, which have somehow followed us from every location, are front and center next to a podium where people will once again speak to what a wonderful father, son, brother, (criminal), blah blah blah Dino was.
 Everyone is seated and the service is ready to begin.
 Once the sermon begins, though, guess what is back?
 Yep, we can hear the helicopter, but we can’t see it through trees and tent.
 The noise gets louder and louder and it suddenly drops down behind the podium.
 The wind from the swirling blades intensifies and the flower displays that sit on tripods start to fall forward and the tent begins to rattle and shake, the wind starts to uproot the tent from the stakes which anchor it.
 The helicopter is facing us and begins to slowly maneuver to expose its side.
 The tent is ripped from the ground and tumbles away leaving a clear view of the black helicopter that is lowering itself closer to the ground.
 The helicopter is about thirty feet above the ground, and now just behind the podium, over the limos.

Sure, celebrities and other billionaires father kids when they’re ancient, but they can afford nannies who take screaming babies for walks in the park, and they can ship the kids off to boarding schools when as teenagers they metamorphose into demons.
 My big kids are great, and I mean great in the most literal sense.
 Darcy, the artist who could draw better at three years old than I could when she was three and I was thirty three, majored in painting and photography in college and graduated then worked as a newspaper designer but soon turned to teaching.
 She teaches fifth grade kids so underprivileged that not one in her last year’s class of twenty-seven had ever participated in an organized sport.
 She loves the kids, so she’s always developing some new method, like creating a bi-weekly newspaper and having them write columns on their favorite subjects or assigning them to design their dream house and using the assignment to teach basic geometry.
 In summer, at the Boy’s and Girl’s Club, she teaches art to teenagers, most of them troubled or in trouble.
 Darcy’s great because her giant’s heart is open and she uses her brains and imagination in generous ways.
 And Cody’s one of those most-rare people who have all the tools.
 He’s strong, smart, industrious, and even handsomer than his dad.
 He’ll graduate with a B.A.

"Probably not, but that doesn't change the fact that this is what I want to do."
 His sigh was ample evidence he didn't believe me.
 It probably didn't help that I'd moved in closer as I finished speaking, but I was already worrying about something else he'd said.
 "Alec, everyone keeps talking as though this fight is soon, but I've never heard an actual date."
 He finally wrapped his arms back around me, but it was a subconscious move, as if he was trying to protect me from what he was going to have to say next.
 "It's after the dance.
 The night of the new moon, an hour or two after the Ashure Day celebration ends."
 I was suddenly even more grateful we were going to the dance together.
 If I only had a couple of weeks to live, then I wanted to spend every possible second with him.
 Chapter 27 I groaned as Alec circled two of my biology essays and handed them back to me.

“Perhaps I can get close enough to cast a spell on one or two.
 They are on flat ground, so I see no way to ambush them.”
 “Then why don’t we just walk over, say hello, and then whack ’em?” Harruq asked.
 “My dear brother,” Qurrah said, “that is a very good question.”
 Brazenly, they approached the campfire.
 They kept their weapons sheathed and hidden.
 The closer they got before the men panicked the better.
 “Halt, who goes there?” one of the guards shouted to them as they neared.
 They wore polished chainmail shining red in the firelight.
 The crest of Neldar adorned their tabards.

He said that last with his heart stopping blue eyes gazing directly into mine and I nearly stopped breathing.
 Somehow he hadn't realized yet that when he looked at me like that there wasn't anything I could deny him.
 "Ok, you can get me a present, something small and relatively inexpensive."
 Alec smiled and reached over to the backpack as he sat up.
 I let him pull me up and then felt my face freeze as he pulled out one of the largest velvet boxes I'd ever seen.
 "Alec, no."
 "It wasn't that expensive and you've already told me I could."
 "I didn't think you'd have something already ready and waiting to ambush me with.
 I thought I'd at least have a few days to prepare myself."
 He smiled again and I gingerly held my hand out.

Rodregas was very glad that he had insisted that she learn the fundamentals of blade work.
 “So what now?” he asked.
 “Now we go see if we can get some greater sigils,” said Doi’van.
 “We?” Rodregas asked.
 “And have you decided to take a greater sigil even it if cost you most of your magic?” Doi’van nodded and said, “Yes, I like to learn magic, but we are on a mission, one that is very important.
 The Immortalists, especially Taiga, must be stopped.
 If we are going to do that I will be of most use as a warrior.
 We have a powerful magic user,” he said with a smile.
 Imeralda smiled back at the complement and the three got back and continued their walk to the Chamber of Sigils.

But all I need is to recognize the long shot possibility that the dearest person I have known gave his life for me and, despite the sorrow, my heart leaps with adoration.
 For a moment on Highway 101 in Pismo Beach, I feel sure that Eric was Jesus.
 Not in full, as in a Second Coming.
 But in a way so that Jesus entered him and took possession.
 While this thought grips me, both Eric and Jesus become so precious the word adore feels timid and weak.
 Cliff and Toni
 A semi cuts in front of me while we climb Cuesta grade, just north of San Luis Obispo.
 Surrounded by semis, I decide I had better return to the mundane world.
 The last dozen miles to Cliff’s home in Atascadero I spend wondering if I could possibly write something that might introduce Cliff, Billy, and Bob to God.
 I suppose I’m an evangelical but I don’t like to confront people.

"Vincent!"
 I was disoriented for a second.
 The yell had come from behind me, and had torn the two apart faster than I'd believed possible.
 The crowd, packed so tightly that I'd been worried someone was going to get pushed over the railing, separated as Alec flowed down the stairs.
 I'd only thought Isaac and Vincent were graceful.
 Alec made them look like drunken frat boys.
 Vincent spun around so fast it almost looked like he was going to fall down and then backed away from both of them like a cornered animal.
 It was hard to decide whether my excitement at seeing the biggest jerk I'd ever met humbled outweighed my dislike for Alec, who'd pretty much locked up the honor of being the second biggest jerk.
 A surge of dread washed through me as Vincent backed closer to the wall in an effort to maintain his distance from Alec.
 I half expected for the incredible tension I'd been feeling before to disappear, but instead it morphed slightly.

 “I wouldn’t mind going back home,” Harruq said.
 “Sound good to you, Qurrah?”
 “Wherever you two go, I will follow,” he answered.
 “Settled then,” Aurelia said.
 “You two are going to have to play along when we get there, though.” She glanced at the sky, which was still speckled with stars even though dawn fast approached.
 “We’ll wait until morning.

After all, you can't really expect to do everything by yourself.
 Occasionally a helping hand is exactly what's called for."
 The words reached inside me, pulling on something that was already bleeding, tearing it further.
 The classroom rocked back and forth at the same time my legs lost the ability to support my weight.
 Alec lunged toward me, moving incredibly quickly as my mind spun away back to our kitchen table.
 I was fourteen and trying to understand geometry proofs.
 Mom had given up trying to help me with homework about the time I turned twelve, so she kept telling me to just read the book and figure out what they were doing in the examples.
 By the time Dad got home from work tears were streaming down my face and I couldn't even see the diagrams anymore.
 "I can't do it, Dad.
 Missy Jeffrys already did the entire assignment before we even got out of class, and I can't even figure out one problem.

She tried to yell at me and it came out, “Thut uhp!

 I kept reading, enthralled.
 It seemed to be a journal, written by a girl, but I had no idea who.
 Chevelle’s family?
 Why would he have a young girl’s diary?
 It was filled with pointless stories as far as I could tell, but after a few pages the writing matured and it seemed to jump several years.
 I wished it was dated.
 I tire so easily of the formalities here.
 The only thing I have to look forward to are the few breaks I get to go out on my own, into the pines.

 “This city has long been treated neutral, even though it resides within Neldar’s border.
 The elves will not take kindly to removal from a home many have lived in since before our dear king’s grandparents were alive.”
 “I eagerly await the bloodshed,” Qurrah said.
 He bowed to his master.
 “Go.
 The night is young.
 Taint the dreams of the slumbering.”
 Qurrah left Velixar to sit alone before the fire.

 They went downstairs hand in hand.
 "Do you want some breakfast before .

 before you go?"
 "No, thank you.
 I'm not hungry."
 Rick hesitated at the kitchen door, glancing at Marie.
 He wanted to beg her to stay with him, to get down on his knees if he had to, cry, plead.

"You said that this was very modest."
 "It is."
 "Then why are you looking at me like that?"
 He swallowed.
 "I've never seen anyone who looks as good as you in one."
 She smiled then, reaching for his hand.
 "Come on--let's go."
 "Wait.

It took several minutes to gather my thoughts enough to know where I was.
 In bed… at Ruby’s.
 Ruby, the half-breed.
 I was drenched in sweat.
 My head throbbed.
 Something had happened to me.
 Fairy dust, Steed had said.
 Steed.
 Yes, he had shown up last night.
 Voices echoed through the open door.

 Dieredon gave a one-shoulder shrug.
 “Very well.

 “War is coming.

“Captain Intreg, do you mind asking a few questions to confirm his status?” The Knight seemed uncomfortable under the hand of the sorcerer but nodded and said to Rodregas, “What is the eighth law of Chivalry?” “Thou shalt never offer combat to someone who is not equal in strength, unless in defense of the honor of the Order, for Justice for the oppressed or in defense of the weak,” he answered.
 Captain Intreg nodded and then asked, “A question of law: two messenger couriers stop at a keep with priority messages and switch out horses.
 The local lord finds that both horses are lame and are no longer any good.
 One of the messengers is from a neighboring lord and one from the Guild of the Celestial Path.
 What rights does the lord have in this situation?” Rodregas noticed the sorcerer seemed to stiffen at the question.
 Rodregas’ mind swirled.
 The first questions had been easy, but it had been a very long time since he had studied law.
 The sorcerer’s body language, though, directed his memory to the answer.
 Rodregas said, “The local lord is responsible for replacing the other lord messenger’s lame horse.
 There is nothing to be done for the Immortalist messenger’s horse.

I rolled over and pulled the note out from its hiding place in my dresser.
 I had the words memorized already; the symbol was what I wanted now.
 The note was proof of the existence of our benefactor, but the sigil on the bottom of the page was a clue to his identity.
 It was incredibly intricate and completely different than anything I'd ever seen.
 Once again I traced the sharp edges and smooth swirls with my eyes, marveling at the way it hinted at further complexity lurking just out of sight.
 With a sigh of resignation I hid the note once again and pulled myself out of bed.
 Convinced as I was that Brandon was our benefactor, I no longer felt any qualms about trusting him to come pick me up.
 I waited in the living room until I saw him pull up, and then skipped out to meet him with a smile.
 He reached over and opened my door, but some of the usual casualness was missing from his smile.
 "Something wrong?"

When it became his turn, Rodregas stood there silently.
 The knight, an older man with a short gray beard, who was missing his left hand, waved him forward.
 The Knight Captain slowly looked up at the tall figure before him and after a quick examination went to the oddly mismatched pair that stood at each shoulder.
 “You are a squire who wishes to register for the tournament?” asked the Knight Captain.
 While the Knight had probably asked this to a lot of people that day, his tone suggested real curiosity.
 Rodregas grunted acknowledgment and dropped his hand with the Patch of his Knightly Chapter in it.
 The Knight Captain picked it up and studied the detailed patterns woven into the fabric.
 “Chapter and heredity?” the Knight asked.
 “Saurrien was my mentor, Quirren was his mentor, and Bitress was his, Chapter of the Silver Mace,” Rodregas answered.
 The Knight nodded, the answer matched the pattern on the patch.

I need to see a healer.” Rodregas stared at the sorcerer in disbelief.
 He suffered a few minor injuries and he expected they would just go get him a healer?
 The man killed people to steal their bodies and power.
 How could he think they would respond to such a request?
 “Please hurry, I need a healer now,” Van’dret demanded.
 “We will get you a healer as soon as you finish answering our questions,” said Doi’van, his voice more growl than speech.
 “First tell us who among the Immortalists are trying to break ‘The One Law’ and why,” “I can’t,” Van’dret whimpered.
 “I mean I don’t know anything about Immortalists breaking ‘The One Law.’” He suddenly groaned and would have doubled up if Doi’van had not been sitting on his chest.
 Imeralda smiled.
 She was poking his two wounds with her fingers.

All right."
 Somewhat dazed, she went to her room, only to find that she'd left her key in Rick's room.
 She returned, glancing up at him sheepishly when he opened the door for her.
 "I forgot my key."
 He retrieved it from the dresser and handed it to her.
 He kissed her lips lightly.
 "Goodnight, sweetheart."
 "Goodnight."
 She went back to her own room, wishing that she could sleep next to him all night.
 They drove down to Tijuana the next day, and Marie was delighted with all the shops and stalls and stands.

I concentrated on a pebble beside me.
 It didn’t shift in the least.
 “Ruby?
 It doesn’t work.” I held my hands in front of me, helpless.
 Panic was taking me when she laid a hand on my shoulder and leaned forward.
 I expected her to calm me, explain it would come back, it would all be okay.
 Glitter was in the air before I could stop her.
 By the time Chevelle returned, I was loopy with it.
 He and Ruby sat facing me.
 She must have filled him in on my problem.

CM: 	Well, run us through the specifics.
 What happened after the album?
 BG: 	Ok, so we got a local reputation, a sort of groundswell, that started small and then ran along the faultline that runs under the Bluff City.
 We were what they call an underground success, what Memphis specializes in.
 We were talked about but you had to be part of the cognoscenti, the insiders.
 I hated this, if I was aware of it—I really don’t remember.
 Keep in mind, all I wanted to do was play my guitar and write songs.
 And I was writing at an astonishing clip and artists were picking up on it, and, well, the money started coming in.
 See, in a way, I was fortunate.
 I never had to sack groceries at Piggly Wiggly or teach school, or cut lawns.

I heard someone beside me and a flash of anger swept through me, lighting a flame at whoever it was.
 So maybe the fury wasn’t completely gone.
 I suddenly remembered the pages I had burnt in the briar patch so long ago.
 Burnt before I’d read them.
 My eyes flashed open.
 I sat up, ignoring my spinning head, but the book was already gone.
 I glared at Chevelle.
 It must have been dreadful, because he nodded and backed away, his mouth tight.
 “Oh, Frey.” Ruby’s voice was low and soothing.
 I grimaced as I turned to her, not at all wanting what I was about to say.

Rising unsteadily, I heard the whisper again.
 But it wasn’t a whisper—it was the wind.
 I glanced backward.
 Paper fell to scatter on the floor.
 I surveyed the library, but it was practically empty.
 Someone on a higher level must have knocked the pages down.
 I bent over and read the closest document.
 It was an account from the northern clans.
 Despite my disbelief, I somehow managed to act quickly, stashing the papers in my shirt before attempting a casual exit to read them at home.
 I made it out of the library and almost to the gate when I noticed a dark figure behind Virden Day’s tree.

The old shape shifter always moved gingerly thanks to old injuries that had left his right leg permanently crippled.
 I hadn't thought anything of it at the time but Donovan was looking frailer lately.
 The thought of Donovan getting to the point that his age was starting to show nearly made me choke up.
 I didn't have the extensive history with Donovan that Alec's family had, but he'd been unfailingly kind to me despite the fact that I'd endangered everything he cared about.
 Alec correctly read my thoughts.
 "Don't worry; I'm sure it's nothing.
 I'll force him to take a couple of days off and I'm sure he'll be fine.
 He's only a bit past middle age for one of us."
 I nearly protested, but Alec was right, it would take an actual order to get Donovan to slow down, and two days was probably pushing it.
 Donovan somehow managed to respectfully circumvent any order he thought prevented him from taking adequate care of Alec's family.

His blond hair was oiled and wavy.
 He wore a silk shirt and drove a fast, red convertible.
 Though he claimed to have gotten out of prison only yesterday, he blazed at about twice the speed limit down Highways 19 and 41 into Florida and all the way to Miami.
 He talked about money, women, and other stuff he’d missed while in prison.
 When he asked if we would be looking for work in Miami and we said probably, he nodded and chucked my arm.
 “Hey, the boss will set you up.” The boss lived in a palace on a canal.
 He was a midget who needed a wheelchair, but whose live-in babe was about twice his height and half his age.
 She reminded me of the barmaid in New Orleans.
 I was mourning the loss of that dream when the midget said, “You guys from San Diego, must’ve driven a boat now and then.” Bob said he had driven a couple speedboats.
 “Sure you did,” the midget said.

 What the year was?
 If they had a television?
 But as the fog began to lift, she could tell that she was still in 2011.
 The house to her left didn't look like any house she'd ever seen before yesterday.
 And she was no longer in a garden--she was walking across a lawn.
 She wanted to keep walking, but with the fog disappearing and no garden in sight, she was afraid it was useless.
 She turned around, eyes down as she headed back to Rick's house.

I half expected for the incredible tension I'd been feeling before to disappear, but instead it morphed slightly.
 If I hadn't known it was absolutely absurd, I would've said it felt like there was a tingly wind blowing down the stairs, pushing Vincent along before it.
 Isaac moved slightly.
 It was a small change of position, but somehow incredibly menacing.
 It wasn't until Vincent froze in place that I realized Isaac's shift had kept Vincent squarely between him and Alec.
 It was like watching a pair of wolves bringing down an elk.
 I'd seen gangs work together like this before, but it seemed strangely out of place in Sanctuary.
 I was positive there was going to be a fight after all, but then Vincent grabbed some poor freshman, shoved him into Isaac, and pushed his way downstairs as Isaac caught the human missile.
 As soon as Vincent was safely out of sight, everyone surged forward to congratulate Isaac on having saved Ben, and Ben on having not died.
 ** The near fight between Isaac and Vincent and then Alec's intervention seemed to be the buzz for the next two hours.

Not exactly pop schmaltz,  you know, ABAB.
 It was a more complex rhythm to the whole speaking—and I did just sort of speak the lyrics—that was Jim.
 At first I wanted to sing it—you know, I’d worked out a melody, a weird melody.
 And he said, on, I don’t know, the like 16th try, Jim said, shit, let’s not sing this one.
 Gimme a Lou Reed kind of thing.
 Half talk the damn story.
 I’m gonna use that melody behind you.
 And he did, man, he played what I was singing on a plastic tonette—no shit, that’s that weird, unearthly descant in the background, Jim on this little toy.
 It’s not in the credits, so you’re getting it first, right?
 And I just did my best Lou Reed impersonation, intoning, Her glances could break arms.

If God asked me to surrender Zoë, not just deliver her into his care in some spiritual sense, but say to give her up, send her to live with her mother or grandma, I believe I would rescind any surrender pledge I had made.
 Meaning I’m probably light years from honest to God surrender.
 And perhaps I’m light years from devoting myself to communion with God.
 Even on lesser matters than Zoë, such as writing books and building the Perelandra College writing programs (another of my obsessions), I hesitate to cut back in order to devote more time to communing with God.
 Even during these meditative times on the road, since Pismo Beach I have devoted as much to thoughts of the book that will come of the journey as to whether it all will help me live more like Brother Lawrence.
 I wonder, if I were given the choice between writing a wonderful book or achieving deeper communion, which would I choose?
 The woman I call Sweet still haunts me.
 I imagine if some good Christian folks would suggest that God might have sent her to me, others would assure me she was in the devil’s employ.
 Whether she came from God, the devil, or by pure coincidence is academic to me.
 If instead of her, Father Abraham would’ve appeared and reminded me that he was willing to not only surrender his son but to impale and burn his own child, I wouldn’t for a moment consider following his lead, even as far as the give her up part.

That was all that mattered.”
 “Tell me of your time with Master,” Velixar ordered.
 “There is little to tell,” Qurrah said.
 “I was his slave.
 I cleaned up after him while he fed me scraps of his failed experiments.
 I slept in a cage.
 One time he caught me practicing words of magic.
 As punishment, he shoved a hot poker down my throat, ruining my voice into what you hear now.
 One night tribes of hyena-men stormed his tower, wanting vengeance for the many of their kind he had taken to butcher and maim.”
 Qurrah kept his eyes low, unable to meet Velixar’s gaze.

He got out cheese and bread, found some fruit and had a good simple meal.
 He would need to pack as much food as possible for his journey.
 The old kitchen drudge was still peeling the same potato when he left the kitchen.
 Freshly fed and feeling better for it, Rodregas went across the main hall and entered the door opposite the kitchen into the barracks section of the keep.
 The place was about as messy as he had ever seen it; the normal tidiness demanded by Captain Poir had apparently been put aside in excitement over the chance to take some time off for the celebration.
 His personal bunk and trunk were a mess.
 His good blanket was missing, as was his spare pair of boots and most of his other belongings.
 Clearly, the rest of the guards had thought him dead and made free with his stuff.
 Rodregas reached into the trunk but all that was left in there were a few bits of trash, a few candle stubs, some scraps of paper and a bit of cloth.
 He reached down and picked up the small piece of cloth and held it up.

I looked up and saw that Emily, Jason, and Seth had been swallowed by the rushing creatures.
 So much for that plan.
 “Emily!” I yelled but my voice was drowned out.
 I saw a flash of fire off to the side.
 Emily was fine.
 I twisted around so that the troll charged past me.
 I turned and plunged my knife into its back before it could respond and it fell to the ground.
 I felt pain flare in my right foot and looked down to see a frost beast with its teeth in my leg.
 When I tried to pull away, in bit down harder.
 “Ow,” I yelped.

My nose was bleeding.
 It took a moment to get my bearings.
 My bed sheets were a tangle and my clothes were disheveled.
 It must have been a dream.
 I had fallen asleep looking at my mother’s pendant, trying to remember her, and somehow combined it with the disaster I had read of the northern clans.
 It was only a dream.
 Shaken, I sat up, struggling to collect myself.
 I reached up to remove the pendant from the hook and squeezed it tight in my fist.
 It felt good, like a connection, and I slid the leather chain over my head, pulling the pendant down to rest on my chest.
 It felt right there and I knew I should have been wearing it all along.

Art – Noooo, that doesn’t feel right to me either.
 Karen – Then what would you prefer Mister?
 Art – Well, it’s a bit of a mouthful, but a bit more accurate than ‘dirty old perverted man’ or whatever.
 I mean ‘dirty old pervert man’ sounds a lot like a super villian’s name or something, and I don’t really think that I could be considered a super villain by any stretch of the concept.
 On top of that there is the ‘old’ part, I’m not really that old, I’m only forty-two years old, which may seem ancient beyond belief to a beautiful young woman such as yourself, but when you get to my level, well, it just kind of is how old you are.
 It doesn’t feel much different than when I was in my twenties or thirties, well I’m in better shape now, which isn’t saying much, I was kind of a nerd back then and didn’t do much exercising…
 Karen – Get on with it.
 Art – Ah yes, where was I?
 Karen – You were eventually going to inform me what you feel I should call you.
 Art – I prefer Art.

“Woodhaven desires death.”
 He drew his sword and spoke softly.
 “So be it.”
 Elves appeared in the windows of every building that lined the center.
 Full quivers hung from their backs.
 Sixty more elves joined their lone companion on the street and readied their bows.
 The men in the center raised their shields, but they knew the deadly aim of a trained elf.
 They were about to be massacred.
 “Stand firm!” Antonil ordered, raising his own shield.
 “Stand firm.

I locked the door for the first time since we'd arrived in Sanctuary, turned on all the downstairs lights, and then slowly walked upstairs.
 It was crazy to be scared that Alec had somehow missed someone, but I couldn't shake the feeling I was being watched.
 Once I finally made it upstairs, I checked both rooms, and the bathroom, before finally relaxing a little.
 I showered quickly, carefully making sure the smell of alcohol and cigarette smoke was out of my hair, and then changed into clean clothes and collapsed onto my bed.
 I was exhausted, but I couldn't fall asleep.
 Every time I closed my eyes, I saw dark shapes hurtling towards me.
 After looking at the clock for the thousandth time, I finally got up and went downstairs.
 The lights were still blazing, just as I'd left them.
 I debated for several seconds before opening the door and stepping out into the darkness.
 Somehow the porch light didn't reach out as far into the yard as I'd remembered.

“Big mistake, elfie,” he said.
 He snatched his swords and sheathed them.
 “I’ll make you pay for that.”
 After a bit of debate, he decided not to tell Qurrah.
 Velixar had already made it clear they needed to be careful.
 Now he understood why.
 He wouldn’t tell Aurelia, either.
 That would be stupid, and stupid he was not…‌most of the time.
 “I need a drink,” he said, turning toward the town and trudging back.
 All he could think about was getting a good, stiff drink.

You can call me…,” he thought for a minute, making it obvious he was making up a fake name.
 He did not want to use his real name.
 He thought to himself, “Who do I want to be?” “If I’m going to try to fight against the Immortalists, then some sort of name fit for a Celestial Paladin, or maybe one fit for an Infernal adversary was needed,” he thought with a smile.
 The only way he could have survived the ceremony would have been divine intervention, so he said the first thing that came to mind, “You can call me Sir Paladin, that will work for now,” he said it with a smile and a slight snicker at his own joke.
 “Just what kind of Paladin would you be?” Imeralda asked him.
 “Why, it should be obvious to you more than anyone,” Rodregas said with a slight bow to the beautiful half AElf.
 “The kind of heroic Paladin that rescues beautiful maidens in distress and frees’ innocent prisoners from the dungeons of evil sorcerers.” Rodregas could not help but smile at his own line.
 He had always found that a good joke was like a good insult; the best always had enough truth in them to sting.
 Geor smiled, but the others seemed not to have appreciated his little joke.
 The AElf maiden just looked at Rodregas quietly and thoughtfully.

People heard I was going to be a father again and asked, "So how old will you be when the baby turns eighteen?"
 or "What if you die?"
 She’s a girl, the doctor said, and I reasoned a girl might be quieter, a little more gentle than a boy.
 Knowing her sex made her more real.
 For the first time, I started getting pictures.
 I saw her as thin, pale skinned and strong like her mom, with reddish hair of a peculiar henna-like tint.
 Her eyes were bright and inquisitive, her mouth ever-ready to speak.
 "Oh Lord," I gasped because my heart was melting.
 A friend once asked me, "Do you think we can grow as much emotionally without having a child as we can with one?"
 All I could say was that my kids taught me how to love and, at twenty-six and twenty-three, they’re still teaching me.

CM:  	This was what year?
 BG:  	Lessee, I was nine or ten so…
 CM: 	And that’s your earliest musical memory?
 BG:  	Yeah.
 Oh, naw, no.
 I mean, I was about five and my parents had this set of records, this Reader’s Digest set, and there was this one song that I fell in love with on it, used to go around the house, scatting it, at five.
 It was “I Can’t Get Started” by Bunny Berigan.
 I don’t know.
 I can still play that one.
 CM:  	So, you grew up in a musical house?

She was so sweet and loving.
 When she returned, he took the aspirin and drank the juice, obeying when she insisted that he lie down on the sofa so that she could bathe his face with cool water.
 Marie patted his forehead with the washcloth, dipped it into the bowl of water, wrung it out, and then patted his forehead again.
 "Maybe a good night's sleep will help ward off a cold."
 She kissed his temple.
 He took her hand, pressing his lips into her palm.
 "Lie down here with me."
 She stretched out beside him, and finally, with Marie in his arms, he fell asleep.
 But when he awoke the next morning, she wasn't there.
 Panicking, he jumped up.

"Of course--I'll take care of her."
 The lady could tell Marie's underwear size with no problem.
 But when Marie came out of the dressing room complaining that the 32B was too tight, she wondered how she'd missed the girl's bust size by such a margin.
 Marie found that she loved shopping for modern lingerie.
 She liked lace and rich colors and chose black, emerald, fuchsia, and royal blue underwear.
 It really didn't matter, she supposed, what her underwear looked like.
 But she couldn't wait to get home and change into her new things.
 "Thank you for-for .

"Thank you for saving my life.
 Were those wolves some of Brandon's friends?"
 I felt him nod.
 "Simon and Nathanial."
 "I didn't know them that well, they mostly ignored me, but I didn't think they'd kill me."
 Alec finally put his arms around me.
 He hugged me like I was made out of fine china, but it was a start.
 The tingling sensation I'd always felt around Brandon was back, stronger than ever.
 Despite the incredibly grave nature of everything that'd happened in the last few hours, I felt mildly euphoric.
 Maybe this was what people were talking about when they said they were buzzed.

 Liz – Court fees usually are.
 Maybe this won’t take too much, unless your dad doesn’t let go.
 Eugene – He will.
 Why shouldn’t he.
 Liz – It was just a thought.
 Eugene – I don’t see why he would hold me back, it’s not as if…
 Jim – Gene, did you ever find those Japanese tourists?
 Eugene – What Japanese tourists?
 Liz – The ones you went out looking for this morning.

No illusion and no disguise.
 You two cretins have god-damned elf blood in you.”
 “You jest,” Qurrah said, hanging back and showing no sign of aggression.
 The soldiers clearly thought Harruq the more dangerous of the two, and he was more than willing to let them continue thinking that.
 “No jest,” the guard said.
 “You two are leaving this city, now.”
 “My things,” Harruq said, his voice coming out as a weak croak.
 “I don’t see anything,” said the guard, scooping down and retrieving the scattered coins Harruq had dropped.
 “In the shed,” Qurrah said.
 “That where you two live?”

Only the top ten finishers qualified.
 There was no taking turns.
 The ten were spread out in a circle.
 In the center of the arena was a shield painted with the seal of the knighthood, a winged sword in the clouds.
 The squire who claimed that shield and made it to the Cathedral’s main hall with it would be knighted on the spot by the Knight Commander of the Order.
 This day would decide Rodregas’ fate.
 It was likely to end in defeat.
 He stood flexing his sore shoulders, waiting for the flag to drop.
 Across from him was Geriodon who was standing tall and ready in his Night Bronze armor.
 He looked to have gotten much more sleep than Rodregas, and of course, now he also had a minor Sigil of Healing.

bla, my crack-berry rang.
 I looked at the caller ID and it was Steve’s number, not Ashley’s.
 This was even better since the goal was to get him and she was ancillary.
 I picked up the phone, which was still connected to the recording device, and she introduced herself and said she was calling from her boyfriend’s phone because hers was broken.
 The call went better than expected as you could hear Steve coaching her in the background.
 Ashley fell nicely into all of the comments the police wanted to record.
 I was told by Officer White to tell her I could meet her in a couple of days as I was out of town.
 I told her I would call her when I returned and after work hours.
 She agreed and the call ended.
 At the time, I didn’t understand why we didn’t just go do the deal right away, but the cops needed to get a crew together and do all this planning for the bust.

Imeralda asked, “Does that mean that in this room these are great sigils as well?
 Ones that require Infernal sourced magic to work?
 That kind of makes sense if you can have greater sigils that are the shapes of the Celestial Beasts.
 Why not daemons of the Infernal Realm as well?
 But what is the One Tree?
 It is not a beast of a realm, it is the symbol of the Nymph people.
 It can’t be a sigil, can it?” she asked.
 Neither Doi’van nor Rodregas answered and the three of them stood there, each caught up in their own thoughts.
 Finally, Doi’van spoke, “I am going to see what lies in this Chamber.
 Will you be alright?” he asked Imeralda.

"Hi--what's for dinner?"
 "Steak, baked potato, and salad--chocolate cake for dessert.
 Sharon insisted we keep it simple."
 Rick smiled, accepting the cup of tea Ted had known he'd want.
 "I'm liking this girl better and better."
 She arrived five minutes later, and Rick's earlier impressions held.
 She was pretty and slender, friendly but just reticent enough to convince him he wasn't being pursued.
 "Lauri says you're a paralegal," Rick said as they sat sipping tea and coffee before dinner.
 "Yeah--in Charlestown."
 "Is that where you live?"

well, Mother has told me she's ready to give me the ring the moment I ask."
 Mrs. Tranton smiled.
 "My son proposing with the family diamond and my daughter getting married in the family wedding gown.
 A mother's dream."
 Marie tried to smile, but the thought of that wedding gown, that symbol of tradition and family and home, upset her.
 Yesterday it had made her long for home.
 Now it made her long for Rick.
 She wanted to wear it for him.
 She certainly wasn't going to wear it for Davis.
 After breakfast Mr. Tranton went to call his daughter’s betrothed.

To intensify the effect of the drug, they consume the pills in alternative ways: First, they remove the time release coating that covers the pill by either scrapping it off with their fingernail or using a wet paper towel.
 Then, they crush the tablet into a powder and snort it.
 When snorting the Oxy begins to clog up and destroy their noses, or just isn’t getting them high enough, the addict places the pill whole, without the coating, onto a small square of aluminum foil, and holds a lighter underneath.
 The addict rolls the pill around the foil in an odd balancing act so as not to lose the pill off the edge of the hot foil, or to leave it in one hot spot too long.
 As it slides from side to side the lighter is moved just ahead of it.
 The pill slowly vaporizes as it is cooked from beneath.
 A thin line of fumes from the pill is released into the air and the addict inhales the vapor through a stem pipe.
 Addicts hardly notice that their fingers and thumbs burn; blisters form where the flame licks back from the bottom of the foil.
 As the pill slides back and forth, it leaves behind a zigzagging black mark resembling a line made by an indelible pen.
 This technique is called “chasing the dragon,” and is reminiscent of a technique for ingesting heroin, Oxy’s unfashionable, yet omnipresent, cousin.

And then we were in the throne room.
 My father’s face was indescribable, his fury almost tangible.
 I couldn’t bring myself to look away from him, but I saw Rune standing in my peripheral vision.
 I was caught.
 I frantically searched for some explanation.
 But he didn’t speak.
 He flipped his arm, dismissing me.
 The tension showed in that small movement and I blanched.
 I started to pull away from the guard but he didn’t release me.
 I realized then I hadn’t been dismissed.

The anti-social forces supporting these activities must be handled with the same firmness and determination applied to hijackers, regardless of whether they are governments, military, criminal or terrorist groups, corporations or banks.
 The power of these measures lies not in the enactment of laws but in their enforcement.
 Enforcement should be made mandatory and automatic.
 At the same time, it must be recognized that force alone can never eliminate these problems at their roots.
 Aggressive energies must be given constructive channels through which to express themselves positively in economic development.
 Unless and until famine and poverty are eliminated, both in developing countries and in the inner cities of the North, these energies will continue to find negative expression through violence.
 Therefore, a comprehensive approach is called for.
 The measures proposed here must be viewed in conjunction with recommendations made elsewhere in this report to eradicate hunger and unemployment.
 Linkages to commodity trade
 Isolated and independently pursued policies, which appeared highly beneficial at the time enacted, often result in unexpected and unwanted consequences that negate the benefits of the original measures.

He's always pleasant."
 The expression on Mallory's face tugged on my heartstrings.
 The open vulnerability there made me cast about for additional tidbits to tell her.
 "He's one of my favorites.
 Rachel and I were already friends, so it made sense that she'd be nice to me, and Dominic at least knew who I was, but Donovan was nice to me right from the start.
 It's almost like he approves of me where some of the others aren't so sure Alec's dating me is a very good idea."
 Mallory's expression was far away as she spoke.
 "Yes, he would approve of the two of you.
 He's the consummate man servant, so very professional that you probably wouldn't ever know it if he didn't like you, but I'm sure he does.
 He approved of Alec's father's choice even back when most of the pack was still energetically opposed to the idea.

Using his magic now was a very different experience.
 Whereas before it had been calming, requiring him to call forth his little bit of power, now he held a whirling tornado of energy.
 It was not a matter of having enough; it was a matter of having almost too much power that overwhelmed the simple spell.
 Rodregas breathed in, trying to keep his mind empty but for the shape and vibration of the magic, as he fed a small amount into the bow.
 For a second he had it.
 The bow responded and Rodregas was able to pull the bow back, but the moment was quickly gone.
 The bow bounced back into its regular shape and his arrow shot up and floundered in the air before falling to earth.
 Where both Imeralda and Doi’van had nailed the dead tree in the exact center, his arrow was closer to the barn then the target.
 Unfortunately, the barn was in the opposite direction.
 Rodregas heard a few unkind chuckles from the other two at his shot.

 Jim – Skinny is the comic relief.
 If the entire thing were just Sumo fighting, and killing his enemies, it would get kind of boring, so they have someone to laugh at.
 Skinny’s other job is to distract the bad guys while Sumo Assassin charges up his Super Sumo Slap Attack.

"Sure?"
 He let her put it in his mouth, feeling her fingertips brush his lips.
 "Hmmm."
 He chewed and swallowed.
 "Maybe if you feed me."
 She put all the food in bowls and heated it in the microwave while he poured fresh tea.
 "Is this pork or chicken?"
 Marie asked as she set a bowl on the table.
 "Chicken.
 Is that OK?"

 "Well, no not really.
 It should be fun still though, right?"
 I found myself returning her smile.

The Millennium Development Goals adopted at the UN Millennium Summit in 2000 represent the essential minimum needs for building a stable, secure, free and prosperous global community.
 We confront once again an unprecedented opportunity and an unfinished agenda.
 Disappointed by our failure to achieve all that seemed possible or disillusioned by the emergence of new, more dreadful challenges, some may feel prompted to curb mind’s contemplation of the greater potentials, dispense with lofty plans and resign themselves to the slower, circuitous pace of progress that characterized earlier periods.
 That choice would be unfortunate.
 For everything in our experience of the past two decades points to the fact that humankind is now capable of more rapid and radical action to build a better common present and future for all.
 We may have become habituated to the astounding magnitude of the events since 1989 and still feel unsatisfied with the results, but we can no longer deny that we collectively possess the capacity to create the world that we choose to create.
 This is still the hour in which anything can happen, provided we are determined to make it happen.
 It is not a question of possibility or prediction, but of decision and determination to walk the talk.
 Peace & Security
 Nuclear Disarmament: The threat of a nuclear holocaust remains very real so long as stockpiles of these weapons remain in existence – their very existence constitutes a threat – and so long as nations or groups insist on the prerogative of manufacturing, possessing and using them.

 Harruq rubbed his eyes and refused to meet Aurelia’s gaze.
 “And then Qurrah removed the spells that kept him from talking and moving.
 He screamed and screamed and he just, he just…‌he tore off his own face.
 He reached up and yanked that mess off him.
 He died.
 Qurrah fell over, too weak to stand.
 Never seen him so scared in my life.
 He kept staring at that guy’s face and blubbering, saying he didn’t mean to.

A modest investment in new institutions to disseminate information can have an impact comparable to that of the information superhighways being heralded in the most industrially advanced nations – accelerating adoption of new activities, magnifying response to government programmes, and doubling the total developmental achievements of a country over the next five years.
 Information as a stimulus to transition
 The people of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are highly educated, but long deprived of free access to information.
 Recent economic reforms have dramatically increased the importance of information in the functioning of the economy.
 The breakdown of the command system necessitates the establishment of new channels for the dissemination of information about economic principles, commercial opportunities and successful practices within and outside the country.
 The macro-economic reforms introduced to free prices and legalize private property cannot generate the desired results, unless the population is also given easy access and exposure to a very wide range of essential in formation on new technologies, legal re forms, trade potentials, self-employment opportunities and modern management practices.
 The plethora of new laws, regulations and deregulations being enacted in these countries have left the population baffled and bewildered regarding what is now legal or illegal, acceptable or not permissible.
 The transition of these nations can be significantly accelerated by systematic dissemination of important information to the population regarding potentials in agriculture, industry, technology, commerce, management and law, as well as in politics, public administration, international relations, education, social institutions and health.
 Information needs of industrial nations
 Even in the information-rich West, where the average citizen is over whelmed by a continuous barrage of ideas, opinions and so-called ‘facts’ of varying accuracy and credibility from myriad sources, there is a need for more reliable information.

He seemed to be growing up.
 He had never really matured like his younger brother because in his world of drugs he was not living reality.
 Easter was rolling around and we planned on visiting him with the family, but only if he completed certain parts of his program by Easter.
 If so, he would be allowed a LOA (Leave Of Absence) for the day.
 If not, we would have Easter with him at the facility.
 He would have been an inpatient for over two months by then, and the Narconon program would keep him as long as they needed until he was ready to graduate or until he left on his own.
 We could only hope that Brandon stayed with the program and left only when he had the tools to stay off the dope.
 In the meantime, I handled the balance of Brandon’s court appointments with a power of attorney and I dealt personally with Officer White to have his charges dropped.
 I appeared in court for Brandon in an environment I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy.
 Young and old alike were escorted into the courtroom, shackled at the hands and ankles in their jail issued orange jump suits.

I was just beginning to doubt whether I’d seen him at all when I spotted him standing across the circle, grinning fiendishly while he dangled an object from his hands.
 It was the feather Ruby had tied in my hair.
 I’d forgotten about it.
 I reached up to feel for it and it was gone.
 I started to get irritated but then the feather was in my other hand and he was back, his hands now empty.
 And then, for no apparent reason but amusement, he did a few somersaults and landed in the center of the circle, smiling.
 I could only shake my head as Ruby clapped beside me, clearly thrilled with the show.
 I thought I must have missed something.
 Grey bowed out of the circle and was replaced by the two tall, silvery elves.
 I found myself startled again; I had not seen them sitting with the group, or anywhere else.

Yeah… Seth sat up quickly and looked around.
 He must have heard it too.
 The ground rumbled in the distance and I didn’t know if it was an earthquake or a stampede of elephants.
 “What’s going on?” I asked.
 Seth crawled back to the edge and I joined him.
 We peered over and I spotted a bunch of monsters stomping their way across the hills.
 Seriously, do these guys know how to walk?
 “Great,” Seth hissed under his breath.
 “Company for us.” “Whoo…” I mumbled.
 He rolled his eyes and shifted his gaze back to the monsters.

"She didn't want to let go, did she?"
 Dom looked for a second like she wasn't going to answer, but she finally shook her head.
 "It's harder to control the instincts, the beast inside us, if you will, while we're in an alternate form.
 Hybrid, wolf, cat, to one extent or another, we become the beast, and if there's one thing animals have figured out, it's that you don't survive by letting a beaten opponent live to learn from their mistakes."
 I felt a shudder go through me at what she was saying.
 "So Alec wasn't kidding when he said it wasn't safe for me to be here?"
 "You're probably not in any more danger today than you were that first night.
 Jessica isn't any fonder of you now than she was then.
 I've been working with James every day since then, but he hasn't really come around yet, so he is still a bit of a problem.
 Luckily, with Alec and Isaac both firmly on your side, and Jasmin starting to develop a liking for you, there isn't a thing those two can really do about it.

“Death is nothing but a recruitment tool for you.”
 Half an hour later, he and a hundred other elves riding atop pegasi followed the necromancer north.
 As they flew, they passed over a small campfire dotting the empty field below.
 Their passage above went unheard and unseen, for the two lone souls sitting on opposite sides of that campfire were deep in conversation.

 “Harruq, I want you to make me a promise.”
 “And what is that?”
 Aurelia leaned back and tucked a few strands of hair behind her ear as high above the stars sparkled sadly.
 “Promise you will never strike at me, or those close to me, ever again.”

"I was prepared to tear into you for not going to the tutoring lab last night, but that hardly seems fair seeing as how you went ahead and did the work by yourself."
 I felt a small glow of satisfaction flare into life, but her next words ensured it didn't get out of hand.
 "Of course, you've got the right answers, and technically you're attacking the problems correctly, but you're leaving out a couple of steps that I think will give you problems a bit later on.
 Please take my advice and spend a little bit of time at the math lab.
 Even if you can't make it every day, you need to come in a few times a week."
 "Yes, ma'am."
 The scolding actually hadn't been that bad, almost like disguised praise.
 Britney looked like she was hoping for something similar, but Mrs. Campbell's expression quickly dashed that idea.
 "You on the other hand definitely need to spend every night at the math lab.
 Your homework was incomplete, and of the problems you bothered to attempt, you didn't do a single one correctly.

“Xelrak failed.
 Despite all the power I granted him, he failed.
 He tried to destroy the Council of Mages, but they destroyed him instead.” Velixar gave a greedy look at Qurrah.
 “He was but a starving boy when I found him.
 I gave him a name and lent him my power.
 It is how I have survived all these centuries.
 I do not risk my own life, choosing instead to give my power to others.
 I am the hilt, and my apprentice is the blade.
 But you…”
 Again that greedy look.

His mind was nearly overwhelmed by the sudden tearing sensation that hit him.
 Blood splattered from two horrid gashes along his forearms, soaking the carpet crimson.
 He collapsed to one knee, his hands latched around his sword.
 He tried to raise the blade, but all the strength had left his hands.
 He had lost too much blood.
 When Harruq came charging forward, Condemnation red and hungry, all he could do was dodge.
 Condemnation shattered what remained of the table.
 The elf rolled, his arms tucked against his chest.
 When he pulled out of the roll, he dashed for a large dresser.
 Inside was a stash of healing potions.

Laura was the other first-period office monitor.
 They skipped down the halls, holding hands and laughing.
 Laura held classroom doors open.
 Eric swooped in with his arms extended like wings, softly humming the Hallelujah chorus from Handel’s Messiah.
 Sunday Kemper was Lane Campbell's new girl.
 She lived a block from our school.
 Her folks either enjoyed our company or preferred to have their daughter at home even if she brought the whole gang with her.
 Their family room had a pool table and a stereo.
 While most of us played eight-ball or listened to Sunday’s dad, Ivan, an engineer, explain how things worked, Eric listened to the Messiah.
 I knew he loved Christmas, which was near.

"No--let's go back to the living room."
 "Aren't you tired?"
 "A little.
 I didn't get much sleep last night.
 But I'd rather talk."
 "All right."
 Arm in arm they returned to the living room and sat on the sofa.
 "Can you tell me anything about what happened, darling?
 If you were hurt or starved?"
 Marie sighed, wishing she could tell her mother everything.

He wrapped his arms around me as I turned again to see my mother.
 A howl of rage escaped her and I started to go to her, but he held me.
 He was restraining me.
 I thrashed against him as I tried to scream, to tell him to let me go, but I had no voice.
 She reached her hand out and I could not move, could not help her, though I knew she was dying.
 I was imprisoned there, unable to move… unable to scream… unable to save her.
 And then I couldn’t see her.
 Something was covering my eyes.
 I struggled yet again but my body felt like lead—heavy, useless.
 Darkness enveloped me and I was underwater, struggling to reach the surface, desperate for air.

 “Clear your mind,” Velixar said to his apprentice.
 “Let the emptiness give you comfort.”
 The wind blew, swirling cold through his ragged clothes.
 Velixar watched his apprentice take several deep breaths.

They seemed to relax a little as Chevelle shook his head and brought his horse back to pace.
 I thought I knew what they were thinking.
 Idiot.
 Ruby answered, “Hmm,” with a cocked eyebrow as she turned to follow the group.
 They were mostly silent the rest of the day, until we stopped for the night.
 The group split after dinner as Anvil and Grey positioned themselves on rocks at the perimeter of our camp.
 Ruby hung out by Grey and Steed busied himself as Chevelle paced stiffly around the camp.
 I was bored again, with everyone entertaining themselves, so I leaned back against a rock and pulled my pack to my lap.
 I wrapped my cloak loosely around me and positioned my legs so I could place the book there and, hopefully, not be found out.
 I wondered how many more days of traveling we’d have.

"I'm glad you feel the same.
 You'd think they'd be a little more welcoming.
 Instead it's like they go out of their way to make sure you know you don't really fit in.
 We've been here a year, and I still can't get invited to any of the really cool parties."
 I'd never been invited to any parties, let alone cool ones.
 I'd never felt the lack too strongly, but I smiled and let Britney keep talking until Mr. Whethers realized it was time to start class.
 I quickly gathered we'd be reading Wuthering Heights, a prospect that both elated and disappointed me.
 After seeing how far behind I was already in Biology, it was nice to know we'd be working on something I'd already been through twice.
 On the other hand I hadn't liked the novel the first time I'd read it, and when I'd gritted my teeth and sat down for a second attempt I'd found I liked it even less.
 Maybe I just lacked the maturity to appreciate Bronte's so-called masterpiece, but I couldn't stand that her characters were almost all really nasty people.

A whisper roused me from my studies and I realized it was late, so I decided to give up and start again the next day.
 Rising unsteadily, I heard the whisper again.
 But it wasn’t a whisper—it was the wind.
 I glanced backward.
 Paper fell to scatter on the floor.
 I surveyed the library, but it was practically empty.
 Someone on a higher level must have knocked the pages down.
 I bent over and read the closest document.
 It was an account from the northern clans.
 Despite my disbelief, I somehow managed to act quickly, stashing the papers in my shirt before attempting a casual exit to read them at home.

“How do we get in?” Harruq asked.
 Qurrah examined the fence, his face locked in a frown.
 “I don’t know.
 I have no spells that can aid us.”
 The bigger half-orc stood and stretched his muscles.
 “Well, up to me then.” He took out Condemnation, grinning as the soft red glow lit up his face.
 “Let’s see how strong this girl is.”
 He swung the blade.
 Qurrah closed his eyes and hoped no significant enchantments guarded the fence.
 If any did, they fizzled against the magic of the ancient sword.

Then he quickly reached down and covered Korin’s mouth, pulled him up, and slipped behind him.
 Rodregas saw Korin’s bulging eyes as he tried to get a better look at his captor.
 Korin struggled but not as if his life depended on it.
 He was probably confused.
 The image of the day that Rodregas had started to hate him came back.
 A family of AElves had been taken prisoner; they were just common AElves with no real magic.
 Korin was interested in the father, a good-looking man.
 The wife was equally beautiful and they had a slim child named Jorin.
 Rodregas had taken Jorin under his wing.
 He had only been working at Raven Keep for a little over a year at the time and was still learning the names of the prisoners.

He ignored it.
 "You're just confused because of what happened to you.
 What did happen to you, by the way?"
 "I came to my senses.

 "Listen, Marie, you don't know what you're saying.
 We can push the date back a bit, get married in October instead of September."
 "What part of `I don't want to marry you' do you not understand?"
 She grinned, because he was obviously taken aback.
 "Yes, I've changed.

It was time to get to work.
 CHAPTER 3 THE RAVEN TOWER
 Rodregas stepped into the master’s bedroom for the first time in his twenty years of service in Raven Tower.
 He was unarmed; unarmored and needed to get as far away from Raven Keep as he could before someone noticed that he was not a sorcerer.
 He had spent too much time on the road without money, and he was not going to repeat the experience if he could help it.
 He needed money.
 Money would buy him what he needed to start his new life.
 Unfortunately, Ravenhurr had not been interested in material wealth, and what money he did have, he tended to spend on materials needed for his magical ceremonies; still there should be something that he could use.
 The bedroom was not large but this floor also held Ravenhurr’s study and a water closet.
 The far wall held a four-poster bed covered by a richly colored duvet.

The revelation was like being hit by a Volvo.
 Somehow I'd assumed that all of the things Brandon had told me were lies.
 "Wait, she really does like Ben?
 I mean Brandon said she did, but I just assumed it was a lie like everything else he told me."
 Rachel patted my hand.
 "Brandon's lies are so convincing precisely because he's so careful to mix a healthy serving of truth in there to go along with the false.
 She's liked Ben for almost as long as I can remember.
 I think it all started when they both ended up at the school nurse together with broken bones due to 'falling down the stairs.'"
 I felt a shiver course through me at the thought of what Rachel was implying.
 Watching Jasmin twirl through moves that seemed to be a modification of East Coast Swing, it was hard to believe anyone so self-possessed could've had that kind of childhood.

But then she saw him and ran to him, throwing her arms around him.
 "I couldn't get back home!"
 "Shhh, shhh--it's all right."
 He hugged her, rocking her gently.
 "How am I going to get back, Rick?
 Am I stuck here forever?"
 "Come on--let's go have some breakfast, and we'll see what else we can think of."
 She let him lead her back to his house.
 Sitting at the table while he made breakfast, she wiped her eyes and cheeks and nose with a paper napkin.
 "I'm never going to get back."

Harruq obeyed.
 His insides churned as icy fingers pressed against his forehead.
 Images crackled through his mind.
 The entire world burned to ash and blew away on the wind.
 The painting revealed beneath was in fluid motion, an artwork of death and fire.
 He saw a city burning, people fleeing in the streets, and then he saw himself dressed in black armor that oozed power.
 Salvation and Condemnation waved high above his head, both drenched in blood.
 He looked like a god among men, and the way the soldiers fell at his feet made him think he might have been one.
 This red-dream self looked straight at him and spoke, but Harruq could not understand the words.
 The sound of his own voice chilled him, though, for it was dark, it was dangerous, and it was exactly like Velixar’s.

Now, with Brandon having taken an interest in me, I got everything from simple acknowledgment of my presence to obvious dislike, and even a couple of people who looked like they wanted to take Britney's place.
 I suppose some people would have been thrilled by the chance to join the top of the social food chain, but it mostly just disgusted me.
 I politely rebuffed the scavengers, ignored the haters, and carefully acknowledged the rest without giving them anything else to go on.
 It was a rather depressing exercise.
 By the time Mrs. Sorenson had fired a couple of ridiculously obscure questions at me, I found the good feelings I'd managed to carry away from the mayor's visit the night before had pretty much evaporated.
 English should have been better.
 Wuthering Heights wasn't ever going to be my favorite book, but Mr. Whethers had made the characters more real in the last few days and I was actually excited to see what he had in store next.
 Unfortunately, Mr. Whethers wasn't there.
 The substitute teacher sitting at his desk didn't even take roll; he just shut the door, told us to keep it down, and flipped open a magazine.
 While I was sitting at my desk wondering what to do with the next hour of my life, something I'd read in the physics book suddenly clicked.

Often government has perceived that its responsibility was to ensure sufficient food to prevent famine, not maximum output and profitability.
 Government machinery has proved effective in forcing through radical measures to disseminate new technology, seed and production methods in the face of crisis, but it usually lacks the driving impetus to work for the highest benefit of individual farmers.
 The shift needed is for planners to study the potentials of the agricultural sector to serve as an engine for job creation and higher incomes, and as a stimulus to industrialization and exports, and then to formulate national goals to maximize exploitation of these potentials.
 Integration of agriculture, marketing and processing
 Conscious efforts can be made to foster the natural linkage between agricultural and industrial development by placing emphasis on crops that have the greatest potential for stimulating the growth of agro-industries, services and exports.
 Filling in the missing links in the chain of processing and distribution, such as pre-cooling for fruit and vegetables, can enable small farmers to produce for national and export markets; it also results in higher at-farm prices and creates alternative forms of rural employment.
 Empowerment of women
 The vast majority of women living in rural areas are engaged in agriculture.
 Therefore, upgrading productivity, skills and incomes in this sector is the single most effective means of improving the livelihood of women in developing countries.
 Skill development programmes in areas such as hybrid seed production, floriculture, inland aquaculture, vegetables and poultry can be particularly beneficial.

You gave me the hope and courage to continue to try to understand your brother and his drug addiction and eventually the addiction of others.
 And a special Thank You to my editor, Robin Martin of Two Songbirds Press, for believing in my story and my ability to convey it.
 I couldn’t have completed this without you!
 Part I: Defining Moments Chapter 1: The Medicine Cabinet I sit alone in my new quad truck with its 22-inch rims; it looks like some 20-year-old spoiled brat has decked it out.
 I am tucked away in a remote parking space at a retail shopping center.
 No one would normally park this far from the grocery store, which anchors an array of businesses, at least not this late at night in this sparsely populated lot.
 I know this place well, as this is where my wife and I buy our groceries.
 It is in an upper class neighborhood serving the wealthy residents who live in their posh homes nearby.
 The front of my truck faces a short decorative fence, which borders a greenbelt area, and I stare across the wetlands that the railing protects.
 As I sit, I think about the circumstances in my life that brought me to this spot.

I wasn’t sure what to do, and I looked toward Chevelle out of desperation.
 He was watching me, surprise clear on his face.
 Whatever I’d been accused of, he hadn’t expected it.
 The council elders mistook the exchange as an answer.
 “Chevelle Vattier, you have led this fusion?” His head whipped back toward the council table and he shot out a forceful, “No.” They focused once more on me.
 “I ask again, Elfreda, who taught you the magic to seal yourself to the crystal?” I was at a loss.
 I stood, helpless, as Chevelle spoke up.
 “Elfreda.” He’d used my given name, I hoped simply because we were in a formal setting and not because of whatever horrible thing I had been accused of.
 He was pleading now.
 “Where did you learn how to fuse the pendant with your blood?” Fuse the pendant with my blood?

She banged on the door.
 The door opened, and her father stared at her in shock.
 Her mother, however, jumped out of bed with a cry of joy and threw her arms around Marie.
 "Marie!
 You're all right!
 I can't believe you're all right!"
 Mr. Tranton at last recovered and wrapped his arms around both women, laying his cheek against his daughter's hair.
 He'd thought he'd been in control of his world until Marie had disappeared.
 He would have given that world to have her back.
 Marie pulled back a bit when she heard her father sniff.

She turned to see a female elf, a friend of hers from many years before she moved to Woodhaven.
 “Yes, Felewen?”
 Felewen stood beside her and faced the window.
 Her hair was tied in a long, black ponytail, her slender figure covered by rare chainmail crafted of the hardest metals known to the intelligent races.
 She had come from deep within Nellassar, the thriving capital of the Dezren elves, as just one of many that had arrived to protect the town.
 “Many are dying,” Felewen said.
 “The humans have a spellcaster of their own who repelled our ambush.”
 Aurelia nodded.
 She knew something had gone wrong; otherwise, the battle would have been over in seconds.
 “Very well,” Aurelia said.

Somehow my dream of seeing Les Misérables had morphed into a dream of seeing Les Misérables with Rachel.
 We still didn't get to spend much time together, but she was rapidly becoming the only person I could confide in besides Brandon.
 A boyfriend, or near-boyfriend, was nice, but some things just needed to be shared with another female.
 I couldn't tell my mom about my feelings for Brandon or she'd absolutely freak.
 After spending so much time lying to her about the origin of the almost four dozen roses, I couldn't afford any kind of slip in that regard.
 She'd thought the single rose, Lagrimas del Angel, as I was calling it now, had been sweet and thoughtful, especially when I'd told her it was from an anonymous admirer.
 The other roses had been an entirely different matter.
 I'd had to do some pretty quick talking to convince her I didn't know who they were from either.
 All of which meant I still hadn't told her I'd been asked to the Ashure Day Dance.
 Luckily, Rachel was the perfect listener, even if she did cringe a little every time I mentioned Brandon.

It had felt like I was abandoning Cindi by doing so, but just seeing Cindi's half of the twin pendants we'd received two years before had been enough to send me into a tailspin.
 A detached part of me noted that it was just like Mom to have lied about having lost Cindi's.
 She'd known I couldn't handle the reminder of what we'd lost, but she'd been unwilling to give up that link to the past.
 The thought slipped away like sunlight skipping across water a split second before the storm arrived.
 The attack was a bad one.
 I lost more time.
 I must have slept at some point, but the next time I surfaced it was Saturday morning and I was sitting in front of an empty bowl with an unopened box of cereal and a gallon of milk waiting in the wings.
 At some point I realized I wasn't hungry.
 I put everything back away and went upstairs for a shower.
 It didn't help.

It's the only way to guarantee your safety."
 I shook my head.
 "I'm not leaving.
 I believe you when you say my going back to Brandon won't solve anything, but I'm not going to run away and leave you all to deal with the mess I created.
 I wish you'd stop asking me to."
 His gaze was long and steady, but finally he nodded.
 "You have as much right to see this through as anyone else does, but it's almost certainly going to get a lot uglier before it's over.
 Your freedom is going to be incredibly restricted, at least as bad as it was today.
 We'll escort you to school, stay just long enough to ensure we don't get in trouble, and then hurry back to our territory.
 At least if Brandon's pack does come after us there, we're within our rights to do something about it."

I managed to slowly shake my head no, despite my lassitude.
 Alec waited several seconds, and then sighed.
 "Well, I suppose I'd better get you off to bed."
 The words initially didn't mean anything to me.
 I heard them, but my mind refused to assign meanings to the sounds.
 It wasn't until he'd moved his arm and rolled out of bed with his characteristic speed and grace that I finally realized he meant to take me to the Lilac Room and then return here to sleep.
 I suddenly had a hard time breathing.
 The idea of lying alone in the dark, in the very room I'd just seen Brandon demolish, sent my heart into an erratic rhythm.
 If there'd been an EMT present they'd have already been charging up the defibrillator.
 Alec turned around while I was still trying to get my throat to work again.

The job of the guards was to remain outside the circle but make sure that the prisoners stayed inside.
 Metal would interfere with the magic so the guards held simple wooden clubs and wore only linen clothes with no metal fastenings.
 As Rodregas pushed the half AElf into her circle, making sure not to disturb the bluish sand covered in swirls of colorful small crystals, he was surprised at how vulnerable he felt without his armor but readied himself for the task at hand.
 He quickly reached out to the woman and pulled off her gag, as even that would count as a binding and would interfere with the ritual.
 He wanted to whisper to her as he removed it, and give her a hint of the desperate gambit that he was about to try, but he knew that it was not worth the risk of others overhearing.
 Both of their lives depended on her doing what Rodregas had told her.
 If he succeeded, she would know what Rodregas had done; if he failed, well he was familiar enough with that feeling.
 He saw her lips forming something under her breath, probably a spell, but she did not have time to execute a spell of sufficient strength in the time left her.
 Magic took too long to prepare to be useful so quickly.
 Ravenhurr stepped into the last circle; the one made entirely of what appeared to be fresh blood and of symbols made from the careful placement of living organs.

I see her bring in all sorts of interesting finds, but she refuses to tell me where she got them.
 I wish there were a way to sneak out.
 I would follow her or force her to show me, but Father is keeping a close eye on me, making certain I stick to a strict schedule.
 This morning he brought in a detailed list for Rune, giving him direction through a series of tasks.
 Rune is supposed to grade me on them, see which I excel most at so they can pick a specific field to concentrate on.
 I don’t know how extensive it was, but I saw ‘wind,’ ‘water,’ ‘growth,’ ‘transfer,’ ‘fire,’ and ‘foresight’ written as it passed between them.
 We had already done months of fire.
 Pass it through water, see how large a flame I can create, see how hot I can go, test me on this, test me on that.
 And now he asks Rune to test me in the impossible, to see the future.
 He expects too much.

All too soon, the bus pulled up to a medium-sized, two-story brick building, and five kids my age stood up to leave.
 I followed them, my heart beating a little faster with each step.
 Other kids were trickling over to the door, either from one of the other two buses, or from the smattering of cars in the parking lot.
 Before we'd even made it inside I'd realized just how much I stuck out.
 Shorts seemed to be the order of the day, knee-length khakis for the boys, and everything from mid-thigh on up for the girls.
 The only people in jeans seemed to be the debate-club types.
 Silently groaning at my fashion faux pas, I located a sign pointing towards the office, and slipped around a couple of jocks who paused in their manly mock boxing match just long enough to check out the new girl.
 I silently hoped they slipped and hit each other in the nose.
 I wandered down the white-walled corridor until I found another sign and turned left.
 There was a tall brunette already waiting, so I took a seat in one of the hard-plastic chairs.

It jerked and coiled free of the wound, flicking blood over the tracker’s pristine white robe.
 Behind me, a low voice ordered, “Kill him.” I glanced down at the sword, still in my hand.
 The sword I was supposed to take someone’s head off with.
 I didn’t know who the order had been intended for, but it wasn’t me.
 This man was going to die.
 I knew he didn’t have more than a moment before their magic broke him.
 They would take his life because he was after us.
 After me.
 I didn’t hesitate, just pulled my arm up and swung hard, backhand.
 The blade cut clean and his head rolled backward, hitting the ground with a sickening thud.

She chuckled so hard, for a second I thought the pencil behind her ear was going to fall out.
 "I rather suspect you're understating your accomplishments, my dear.
 Didn't contribute indeed.
 As if Nora's favorite student would just sit around while there were equations to solve."
 I felt like I'd been hit in the stomach.
 I hadn't realized just how fond of me Mrs. Campbell was.
 My mind whirling with too many thoughts to sort out, I turned to go back to my desk, only to find Alec staring at me.
 He still didn't seem happy to be sharing the same room with me, but the complete disgust from half an hour before had been replaced with something more measuring.
 In Spanish, Mrs. Tiggs took special delight in telling us that she'd started grading our tests and a couple of them weren't looking very good.
 I suffered through the last hour of school and then hurried to my locker.

Only one of them could be right, but who?
 Perhaps not, she wondered.
 Perhaps she saw the elf in Harruq while Dieredon saw the orc.
 The kindest man might become a brute when surrounded by other brutes.
 When Harruq was with his brother, or the strange man in black, how then did he behave?
 Could he kill?
 Could he murder?
 She had to know.
 It took a simple invisibility spell to approach their rundown home unnoticed, her feet moving silently because of her natural elven grace.
 It was midday and the sun was high in the sky.

Earlier that day, I had noticed a Kitchen Help Wanted sign in a coffee shop.
 Since I hoped to become an instant father, in order to show the waitress my responsible side, I inquired about the job.
 The manager said, “Not your kind of work.” “Why not?” I asked, and explained that I had enjoyed last summer washing pots in a similar establishment.
 “The kitchen’s all colored help,” he said.
 “Fine with me,” I countered.
 He sighed.
 “See, we only pay Negros a quarter an hour.” Minimum wage was $1.25.
 We had noticed other outrages.
 The man, woman and colored rest rooms.
 The white and colored drinking fountains in the park.

The house to her left didn't look like any house she'd ever seen before yesterday.
 And she was no longer in a garden--she was walking across a lawn.
 She wanted to keep walking, but with the fog disappearing and no garden in sight, she was afraid it was useless.
 She turned around, eyes down as she headed back to Rick's house.
 How would she get back?
 Was she stuck here?
 Her parents must be out of their minds with fear.
 And Davis--he was probably tearing the city apart looking for her.
 Or would after he'd finished work for the day.
 Now where had that uncharitable thought come from?

“He wasn’t supposed to die,” Harruq said, staring right into Aurelia’s eyes so she would know he spoke the truth.
 “We didn’t mean to have what happened happen, but well…‌Qurrah put a bunch of meat on Perry’s face.
 It was old and rancid.
 Poor guy still had to keep smelling it though, and then Qurrah cast his spell.
 “The meat started bubbling and turning watery.
 It ran down his face, getting into his eyes.
 It burned him.
 His skin turned black, like it was rotting.

While I was still trying to decide whether I should radiate smugness at having verbally bested him, or run back to the safety of the tutor room, he lunged forward and grabbed me around the shoulders.
 "I was going to offer you my protection against Cassie and Brandon, and you throw your supposed superiority in my face.
 Fine, but don't come crying back to me when the mask comes off."
 Alec abruptly released me and stalked off.
 He was moving so incredibly quickly he'd disappeared around a corner with one balled-up fist pressed against his side before I'd even started shaking in fear.
 I'd never before been that helpless.
 Had he wanted to, I had no doubt but that he could have easily snapped my neck.
 He was that strong.
 I really was trembling now.
 I wanted to mutter something about overzealous body-builders lifting just to intimidate people, but couldn't get the words out.

It’s about being in bed with a new woman.
 It’s about that moment of intimacy after you’ve spent each other, that time when you’re running your fingers over each other’s bodies, asking about little nooks and crannies, scars and tattoos.
 I said this to a woman—the “white swan woman” in the song—after our first intercourse.
 I said to her, “If you push your belly button…” and she laughed long and hard.
 It became code between us, code for post-coital pleasures.
 By the way, the song makes reference to an actual quote.
 When they asked Casanova what made him such a great lover, he said, “The tenderness afterwards.”  So, the line “the tenderness afterwards” comes from the Seducer, gambler, necromancer and spy, Giovanni Giacomo Casanova.
 CM:  	Ok, um, “Hell in Denmark.”
 BG: 	Well, you know, Lennon’s “Norwegian Wood?” Yeah, man, that’s about some affair he had, right?
 But, he couldn’t talk about it because of Cynthia.

I'd never noticed that Rachel's laugh was possibly the prettiest I'd ever heard.
 Tinkling bells and all that aside, it really did sound like the kind of laugh you'd hear described for the princess of a fairy tale.
 Had I really never heard her laugh before, or was it just that she hadn't ever meant it before?
 "She left about five minutes before James did."
 "Still chatting up her prime candidate for the big dance?"
 Rachel nodded as we skirted the last two tables between us and the one exterior door in the tutor lab.
 "Yep, she's definitely settled on Tim Parsons, who's perfect if you like your men fairly handsome, moderately popular, and built like an ox."
 I wanted to protest, but if anything Rachel was being too kind.
 I'd seen Tim trying to sound out the captions underneath the pictures in Sports Illustrated of his favorite pro football players.
 I was just about to ask who we were going to ride with, more as a way of changing the subject than anything else, when movement off to my right answered the question.

Then Ravenhurr yelled out, “Spirea faira podia turiana,” and the circle holding the Celestial Lion started to burn in the same blue flames, the blue flames that make up the creation forces of life that can only be called up when the Celestial Realm was close.
 Suddenly the sleeping lion looked up in surprise and started to growl and then he started to burn.
 Rodregas had seen enough of lesser versions of the ritual to expect it, but to watch it was amazing.
 The circle blazed with an intense heat that blasted his face and the magnificent creature inside blazed with blue creation fire.
 It was a sudden and violent and primal process.
 The lion started to stand up and then simply fell apart into blazing blue energy.
 That energy surged out of the circle and swirled around inside the larger outer circle.
 Every hair on Rodregas’ body stood at attention.
 Then the blue flaming energy was sucked into the pale green circle.
 There the prisoner, now empty of his own essence, stood still.

He nodded and she rose gracefully from her seat.
 “Well, looks like we have some gathering to do.

 Steed sat across from me, quiet.
 “Seems so sad,” I said.
 I was thinking of Chevelle’s loss, of my own, and now of Ruby’s.
 How could we all be without family?
 “Your mother…” I trailed off.
 He sighed.

“Magic uses more energy the farther away you try to focus it.
 And it is less accurate.

 “All right, I have it.” She smiled.
 “Any more questions or can we begin?” “Fine.
 What sort of weapon did you have in mind?” Her smile widened.
 Her hand stretched out to the side and a long, silver sword came from the pile of gear to land in her palm.
 She righted it, twisting the blade for me to see.
 My stomach dropped.

He promised to.
 But he didn’t.
 Eric told him not to, I would learn the next day.
 Eric, whom no one recalled having done a single mean act, or said a single mean word, had told Kenny to leave us behind.
 When Kenny asked him to explain, he only insisted he didn’t want Billy or me along.
 He wouldn’t say why.
 That night on Viejas grade, Mike was driving when they swerved off the road and careened down an embankment.
 On account of some miracle or quirk of physics, the little car didn’t roll, only slammed down on a wide ledge in the mountainside.
 Eric was riding shotgun, where I might've been, since I was taller and longer-legged than any of the others except Mike Beatty, who was driving.
 In those days nobody wore seatbelts.

Alec wasn't at his usual place, but Brandon was at his normal table, surrounded by a smaller than normal group.
 The discussion looked way more intense than normal, and seemed to center around him and Cassie.
 It was all so crazy.
 Two weeks ago my life had revolved around my inability to think of certain things without collapsing.
 That hadn't changed, but now there was a distinct possibility Jasmin was going to hurt me just to ensure I stayed silent.
 Oh, and I was actually considering opening myself up for some very nasty ridicule, just on the infinitesimally slim chance a boy who was so popular, rich, and gorgeous that he shouldn't even know my name might be interested in me.
 Life was supposed to get better as you got older, but it was starting to look like it just got more complicated.
 Just before I looked back down at the shiny aluminum of my now-naked can, Brandon looked up and caught my eye.
 The smile on his face seemed to say all kinds of things.
 I'm sorry I can't come over and talk.

The two paused, each thinking the same thing.
 Finally, Harruq voiced his thoughts.
 “You think Velixar knew it when he sent us to kill him?”
 Qurrah stretched, letting out a small sigh as his back popped.
 “Yes, I do,” he said.
 “Although I don’t know why.
 A test of some sort perhaps?”
 “Getting tired of tests,” Harruq said.
 “Keep such thoughts buried and dead.” Qurrah pointed to the door.
 The cloud of darkness waited.

Rodregas could not help but smile, “I know you guys think of my skill with the bow in terms of my inability to use the Black Yew bows.
 But really, I can shoot a bow with skill.” Doi’van and Imeralda looked at him doubtfully.
 “The challenge,” said Doi’van, “is not to be simply good but to be able to outshoot over one hundred other highly skilled warriors, and the targets are multiple and difficult including a moving target.
 Unfortunately, all the targets are within normal range for a human, your strength will not help.
 The good news is this is a competition of skill and they provide the bows.
 The bad news is that it is up to each competing squire to have his own equipment for the other three competitions.
 The sword and the shield competition are limited to light armor.
 You will be at a disadvantage.
 The real problem is going to the completion with the lance and the mace.
 Both have no limit to the armor; and of course, the lance is a mounted competition.

The ravages of war have had the most devastating effect, but inadequate and counter-productive policies have also had a major impact.
 Low mandated prices for agricultural products have acted as a disincentive to producers.
 State control of farm support systems, including marketing, transportation and input supply, is highly bureaucratic, inefficient, and, often, corrupt.
 Overvalued exchange rates encourage the import of low-priced farm products, depress local farm incomes, and make exports uncompetitive.
 Underdeveloped infrastructure results in high transport and marketing costs.
 The slow rate of technological development and diffusion have slowed growth in agricultural productivity.
 Irrigation potential is underdeveloped and poorly managed.
 A major international commitment is needed to reverse the trends and end the famine threat in Africa.
 The region possesses considerable potential that could be converted into higher rates of growth.
 Africa has the world's largest reserve of arable land, one billion hectares, of which only 20 per cent is presently cultivated.

He dropped to his knees as the pressure finally ended.
 Dieredon lifted the bow and reached to his quiver.
 The blades retracted, and in the heartbeat it took him to draw two arrows, a thin string materialized in the air, ready to be drawn.
 The elf fired the arrows.
 Velixar laughed as they pierced into his stomach and chest.
 No blood ran from them.
 “You must do far better than that,” he said, his fingers hooked in strange positions.
 Another blast of dark power washed over Dieredon.
 He felt his right shoulder crack into fragments.
 Darkness swam before his eyes, darkness dominated by twin red orbs.

This report calls upon nations and the international community to make a conscious shift to values that can generate greater domestic and international security, higher rates of sustainable growth, and more equitable distribution of benefits for all.
 The insistence on immediate abolition of war, eradication of poverty, democratic human rights and full employment expresses a commitment to the pre-eminent values of human life, social and economic as well as political freedom, and the development of the full potential of the individual.
 The achievement of these high human values also requires the achievement of a large number of physical, organizational, social and psychological values: higher productivity, better quality, more efficient utilization of resources, faster speed, more systematic functioning, improved coordination and cooperation, punctuality, cleanliness, open-mindedness, tolerance, harmony and a host of other values essential for high achievement in any field.
 Therefore, we have stressed repeatedly the importance of the value of integration in the formulation of strategies, of maximum utilization of human and social as well as material and technological resources, of greater speed and organization, and other values.
 Values are a powerful instrument to spur development.
 They are goals or standards that set the direction and mobilize the collective cultural energies of the society for great accomplishment.
 They prompt us to strive for the maximum that is conceivable, rather than the mini mum that is achievable.
 Values form the basis for the tremendous developmental achievements of the past two hundred years, such as the Japanese commitment to teamwork and consensus, the American devotion to enterprise and innovation, the German dedication to quality, and the Dutch commitment to partnership with other people, rather than exploitation.
 Development is retarded by the slow pace at which new values are acquired, which normally requires a change of generation.
 But values can also be consciously transmitted through education in order to abridge the time needed for transition.

Troubled spirits, half-demons…”
 The two farmers stared at Corren in horror as the old man’s voice returned to normal.
 “Ashhur will not grant me to see any more.”
 “Gather the children on the west side of the town,” Jeremiah ordered.
 “Tell everyone they must be ready to flee.”
 “Flee from what?” the farmer asked.
 “It doesn’t matter!” Jeremiah shouted.
 “Tell the others!”
 The man went to do as ordered.
 He had not the heart to argue, not with the fear of his nightmare still lingering.

"I can't promise he'll even read it."
 It was a he who'd intervened on our behalf, and Rachel and Alec's father had died years ago, while Brandon's father...actually I knew next to nothing about Brandon's parents.
 I wasn't even sure whether or not they were around.
 They must be though--if it had been a male who'd saved us, then it couldn't be the Graveses, and that left only Brandon's family.
 It was hard to believe that Brandon had stepped in and done so much for us, but the pieces fit together so tightly.
 Brandon was even more wonderful and amazing than I'd thought before.
 Part of me expected this new revelation to keep my mind whirling so fast that it would take me hours to go to sleep.
 I was only partly right.
 It took quite a while for me to go to sleep, but this time the culprit was the light outside my window.
 Chapter 14 For the first time in longer than I could remember, I woke up two minutes before my alarm went off.

Well, I didn’t need to look much past my pocket to score, so we ended up getting drunk and snorting toot to commemorate our father and son reunion.
 At the time, it seemed like, “Wow, my dad is cool,” but I later realized how sick it all truly was.
 The fact is, this man was never a father or a dad or anything to me.
 Richard basically knocked my mother up in high school, married her, had another son and abandoned her and his sons while they were still babies.
 He never paid my mother a dime in child support.
 My mother tried to warn me when I decided I wanted to meet him, but as only time would tell, trying to tell your teenage son anything is a virtual impossibility.
 After I graduated high school, I went to Hawaii with a friend to live.
 The simple reason?
 I was eighteen and that was drinking age in Hawaii.
 I quit my grocery job and took the money I had saved and headed off to the islands.

I mentally reached around for something similar and then finally nodded.
 "I guess I can understand that.
 My mom would have a hard time functioning without me, so I try to do the best I can at taking care of her."
 Rachel's smile lit the room up.
 "That's it exactly.
 Anyways, I mostly just wanted to stop by and see if us girls can take you shopping tomorrow."
 The non sequitur really threw me for a loop.
 "I left my money at home.
 I'm not much of a shopper anyways."
 That last part sounded pretty weak even to me.

Council does not attempt to rule the North.” I considered that, considered my watcher.
 He was a volunteer.
 I seethed for a moment, but flashes of my mother and council cloaks flooded my thoughts and I had to block them.
 “So the North… has no council at all?” His answer was uncomfortable.
 “No.
 No council.” He paused while he formed the rest of his reply.
 Steed watched him, intent.
 “We are… unruled.” “Unruly,” Steed added with a laugh.
 “You’ve never had a council?” Grey shook his head.
 “No rulers?” He gave Steed a sidelong glance.

 You never even came to class, and you got the right answer.
 Did you cheat?
 Is the answer to this problem out there somewhere on the Internet?"
 Alec's face tightened with something I was willing to bet was anger.
 "No, I didn't cheat.
 I did the research to find the answer, presumably just like you did.
 Next time you feel like insulting me, please suppress the urge."
 I had at least one nasty comeback on the tip of my tongue, but I swallowed it.

“He was also arrogant.
 I would expect such a blade from one like him.”
 Harruq shrugged.
 “If I didn’t have my own two swords, I’d use it.”
 The half-orc cut the blade through the air a few times and then sheathed it.
 He turned the weapon over in his hands, marveling at the swimming colors of dark green and black.
 He paused when he found a name written in gold near the hilt.
 “Tun’del,” Harruq read aloud, slowly and carefully.
 “He even has his name on his sword.”
 “Did I not say he was arrogant?”

It’s all subjective.
 Or is that objective?
 Subjective.
 I don’t have any insider knowledge, you know, it’s just what I think, what I see from here.

I felt myself drawing back together, tied by the knots in my stomach and mind.
 A tandem wolf howl sounded in the distance.
 My stomach swam in unease.
 Chapter Thirteen Diary
 The councilman’s body was disposed of, and the group bustled around the clearing.
 I slid my sword into its sheath, careful not to touch the blade.
 I hadn’t comprehended what the flourish of activity meant until Ruby grabbed my arm to conduct me.
 “Come on, we have to pack.” She dragged me along as she rushed back to her house.
 She threw things around her room, sorting and gathering.
 I didn’t really have anything to assemble.

“This is stupid.
 I’m leaving.”
 “Stay, please,” Aurelia said.
 The half-orc halted, turned, and sat back down.
 His face was still beet red but the elf paid it no mind.
 “Alright,” Harruq grumbled.
 “No interrupting, and no saying a thing.
 I just want to get this over with.
 Don’t even know why I’m telling you this.”
 “Because you must,” she said, a bit of her stubbornness returning.

Launch a nationwide public educational programme on the tremendous potential gains in productivity from increased training.
 Support initiatives by providing incentives to intensify training programmes for all employees by every type of commercial and non-commercial institution in order systemati cally to upgrade the technical, vocational, organizational and managerial skills of the workforce.
 10.School-to-work apprenticeship programmes: The transition from school or college to work can be long and difficult.
 Germany's apprenticeship programme equips nearly 70 per cent of all teenagers with employable skills before they enter the workforce.
 Two-thirds of the UK workforce have no vocational or professional qualification, compared with only 25 per cent in Germany.
 There is growing support in the United States for establishment of a national youth apprenticeship training programme that combines classroom schooling with on-the-job skills training to ensure a smooth transition to employment for those who do not pursue higher education.
 11.Link demilitarization to urban employment: The military possesses both the expertise and the physical infrastructure for training large numbers of people in a wide range of technical, vocational and social skills.
 Building upon success ful US Defence Department programmes that re-deploy soldiers to assist troubled inner city youth, closed military bases can be converted into large training centres operated by military teaching staff for instructing and housing urban unemployed youth during an apprenticeship period.
 12.Promote integrated urban development programmes: The Atlanta Project is a bold attempt to evolve a new type of organization to address the problems of inner city poverty and unemployment.
 The inner city of Atlanta, Georgia, has been divided into clusters in which members of the local community work closely with the staff of major corporations, voluntary agencies, religious groups and a wide range of government agencies to identify and promote employment opportunities and other poverty-alleviation activities.

I just couldn't seem to muster up enough concentration to care.
 I was on autopilot now.
 I answered Britney's whispered questions without ever registering them and never once worried about whether or not I'd made sense.
 I parried Mrs. Campbell's concerned inquiries in much the same manner, probably not convincing her that I was okay, but at least persuading her to leave me alone, and then sleep-walked into the cafeteria.
 I hated the fact that I wanted Brandon to come sit down with me.
 If he did a convincing enough job pretending to like me and I tried really hard, maybe I'd believe it'd all just been my imagination.
 It'd be one less piece of my world crumbling out from under me.
 Britney slammed her tray down, but my listless gaze didn't move from the vacant corner where Brandon usually sat.
 A few minutes later a group of girls came to join us.
 I recognized them, but didn't bother putting names to the faces.

“I am running.” I didn’t know why I chose that word.
 I wasn’t bound here.
 Leaving would have sufficed, but it felt like running, felt like escape.
 And I knew I was trapped.
 Someone would stop me.
 Yes, I was running.
 My head swung to locate a noise at the edge of the clearing behind me.
 Long robes… two council members.
 My throat went dry and Chevelle grabbed my shoulders as he spoke in a low voice.

Luckily by the end of the class, Mr. Whethers had become so frustrated with the complete lack of attention being paid him by the gossipers, he'd actually started writing them up for detention.
 As class finally ended, James cracked one of the first smiles I'd ever seen grace his face.
 "Wow.
 I never would've thought anyone could push old Whethers so far.
 He just set a school record for the most detentions assigned in a single class."
 With James' considerable frame opening a route through the crowded hallway, it took almost no time to make it to my locker.
 Jasmin was waiting for me, and if she didn't exactly look overwhelmed with joy, she at least wasn't scowling.
 We were just outside Mrs. Campbell's class when a muted hiss from Jasmin alerted me to impending danger.
 I didn't realize what was happening until I felt the rising tingle of energy wash over me.
 It was both warmer and weaker than normal, and for the first time I realized that Jasmin's power was different than what I'd felt from Alec.

She shook her head.
 "I really don't feel like going out."
 Walking to him, she linked her arms around his neck.
 "I'm sorry, Rick."
 "For what?"
 "For not being able to accept your proposal."
 He rested his forehead against hers.
 "I love you so much, Marie."
 "I love you too."
 "Do you?"

Qurrah narrowed his eyes and stared at the meat in his hands.
 “I have something I wish to try.”
 The bigger half-orc stepped back, willing to watch his brother work.
 While Harruq was skilled in swords and had all the muscle, Qurrah possessed far more interesting talents.
 Qurrah mumbled words, sick and spidery.
 The bones in the slab of meat snapped erect as if pulled by invisible strings.
 He kept whispering, his eyes wide.
 The meat floated from his hands and then lowered into the fire.
 Qurrah twirled his finger, and the slab turned as if on a spit.
 “We’re eating fancy tonight,” Harruq said, tossing the pot back to its corner.

A few times we rode in taxis to motels where prostitutes greeted us.
 We would barter, object to the price, and leave while the coarser of them screeched obscenities.
 Some cabbies, after three or four such stops, stoically delivered us back downtown.
 Others pulled up beside a gang of thugs.
 Then we ran for our lives.
 The night Eric joined us, so did big Mike Beatty.
 He was about 6’6”, 280 pounds.
 We rode with a cabby to three motels.
 After the first, Eric said, “This is bad, Ken.
 I hate this.” At the second motel, he gave the girl half his money, for nothing.

Art – We’ll see what we can do, guess we should let the rest of the family know, I wish I knew how John was going to take it, probably not well.
 Eugene – (Hugs art)Thank-you Art.
 Art – No problem Gene.
 Just a couple things I would like you to do though.
 Eugene – What do you need?
 I’ll do what I can.
 As long as I don’t have to deal with Jerry.
 Art – Nothing of the sort, these are pretty simple.
 First, I want you to stay out of trouble.
 No evil schemes or taking over the world and so forth, either go back to school or come work for me, which ever works best for you, just keep your nose clean.

 She glanced up at him.

 "But what?"
 "I-I need a place to stay until I get back."
 He smiled.
 "I think I can stand having you around for a while."

Two weeks or so he had spent gathering his treasures and giving them away.
 By two nights before the big day, he knew it would be something compared to which most crises meant nothing.
 Very likely, he believed it might be death.
 He told Kenny to leave Billy and me at home.
 In some way he wanted to spare us.
 I used to suppose he hadn't exactly known his motive, only felt that whatever was coming at him, we shouldn’t have to witness.
 The only sense I could make of it all was that something way beyond reason or observation took place in his heart, mind or spirit.
 According to some mysterious cosmic whimsy or brutal plan, Eric had to die and I didn’t.
 So I filed the matter away with other mysteries, of which life offers plenty.
 But on this trip with all its remembering, I may solve the mystery.

"No, it isn't, just bring me along."
 His fist clenched, knotting up the covers next to my head, but I was long past worrying he'd lose control of his beast and hurt me by accident.
 "You heard Mallory.
 The odds are very good that I'm not coming back.
 If the worst happens, the rest of the pack may very well have to try and fight their way out of there.
 They won't be able to get you out, they'll be lucky to survive even fleeing unencumbered.
 I can't ask them to run that gauntlet carrying you the whole way."
 I ran my finger along his cheek, mirroring the motion he'd done to me so many times.
 "Then don't ask them.
 You'll either win, in which case it doesn't matter whether I'm there or not, or else I don't care what happens."

I turned to Emily and said, “Emily, you know anything about this creature?” She looked pale.
 “It's saying, 'Kill half-lings, kill and eat.
 '“ “Well, you better tell it that it's going to have to starve this time because it's not going to be eating anything,” Seth said confidently and held his sword out.
 She shook her head.
 “There is no way that I'm going to say that.” “Jazell, can you see its weakness?” Seth called to me.
 I squinted at the creature, and saw a dark circle under its belly.
 “It's under its belly, but you have to get by the stinger first.
 That might cause us a problem.” “No problem,” Seth replied and swung his sword in an ark.
 “We’ll just cut off the stinger.” “Seth it’s not that simple…” I said but he ignored me.

 Liz – Sometimes I think you were dropped on your head as a baby, but with a skull that thick I think that you hurt the floor worse than it hurt you.
 Come on, I want your opinion on my work.

What I mean is that rock wouldn’t have held it’s place if it hadn’t shifted, if the words didn’t start to mean something.
 It was time.
 It was time for music to mean something.
 Dylan, The Beatles, they led the way.
 They said, you know, show us the plan, you don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.
 And the kids sat up and listened.
 It was coming, this revolution of meaning, this concentration on the word.
 And, all along, behind it like a dark river, ran the beat, the melody, a sort of communication device that was both insidious and right out there in the open.
 See, rock wasn’t subversive to the people who wanted to know.
 It didn’t trick anybody.

 Shame?
 She didn’t know.
 She didn’t want to know.
 Magic sparked on her fingertips.

Chevelle answered my unspoken question.
 “Yes, it’s… tricky.” He smiled a little at using Steed’s word.
 “You can’t change something’s makeup, but you can change the way it appears.
 You can move it, but only if you’re near.
 You can stop someone’s heart, but you can’t make them feel happy about it.” He hesitated after that last part, contemplating, and then continued, “You can manipulate the elements, move water, draw it from the ground, but you cannot easily make it appear from nothing… though one can usually collect moisture from the air.
 Fire is easier.
 It spreads so fast.
 You can pull a small spark from anywhere to create a flame, fueled by the air and…” He trailed off as I leaned closer to him, listening intently.
 Chevelle looked into my eyes, words forgotten.
 I didn’t know what he had seen there, but he blinked, shaking his head.

"Davis would die of apoplexy if he could see me now."
 "He's not the adventurer you are, I take it."
 "Hardly."
 Rick wanted to seize the opportunity and led her toward a frozen yogurt stand so that they could sit down and talk.
 "I bet you don't have frozen yogurt in 1927."
 "No," she replied, intrigued.
 "What is it?"
 "It's like ice cream but better for you.
 The flavors are on that board.

“Shouldn’t have left you alone,” he said quietly.
 There was a tinkling laugh in the front room and I groaned.
 She was here, too.
 The water helped.
 I was able to sit up with Chevelle’s assistance.
 Ruby swirled into the room, dressed in a red frock of sorts.
 The color hurt my eyes.
 “Here, a bath will help.
 Come with me, dear.” Her hair was tied halfway back with a scarf, the tattered ends mingling with crimson curls.
 I felt dizzy again.

A light fog hovers above the shallow water and dissipates into the cattails that line its shore.
 It is getting darker by the moment, but my eyes have adjusted and I can clearly see the cars that cross.
 I eliminate them as they drive past.
 I am looking for one of two cars I believe they will be driving.
 Will it be the red Dodge Charger or the white Lexus sedan or perhaps a complete surprise?
 One way or the next, they know where I am and what I am driving and exactly where I am parked.
 I have met Ashley, so she should have no problem identifying me.
 I focus on the occupants of car after car.
 I am far too tense to be sleepy, but I am dazed by the constant parade of memories and possibilities that march through my head as I attempt to digest thousands of thoughts—hell bent on answering the question: Why do I sit here?
 It has been many years since I have been involved in a drug deal, and my assumption is that the process hasn’t changed much.

Another twist.
 Qurrah leaned forward, clutching at his tormenter’s shaking hands.
 Words spilled from the half-orc’s mouth, garbled and nearly unintelligible.
 “What is it you wish to say to me?” the elf asked, ignoring the flailing hands that pawed at his face.
 “ _Hemorrhage,_ ” the half-orc hissed.
 The elf’s face exploded.
 Qurrah fell over onto his side, breathing as slowly as he could through the blood that filled his throat.
 The dead body of the elf crumpled in front of him, all of his hate-filled features gone from his face except for a single eye.
 The half-orc stared, wondering if his brother was truly dead.
 Darkness crept at the corner of his sight.

But we still proceed with our heads turned back, looking for shadows behind us at a time when the future demands our full attention in order to capitalize fully on what these events have prepared and made possible.
 In this report, the Commission is calling for a comprehensive, multi-pronged approach to the problem of international security that defies and will continue to defy partial solutions.
 That approach recognizes the critical importance of the linkages between the establishment of democratic political systems at the national and the international level, the abolition of war as an instrument of policy, the elimination of highly destabilizing weapons of mass destruction, substantial additional cuts in defence spending by all parties, and the constitution of a cooperative international security system that is not state-centred and is supported by a standing international peace force.
 Taken separately, each of these elements can sub stantially contribute to improving the international political and security environment.
 Taken together as a cohesive whole, they can transform global political affairs and create a highly conducive atmosphere for the eradication of the pressing economic problems confronting us.
 Recommendations on the UN, Peace Keeping, and Arms Control
 1.Establishment and maintenance of a multi-party democratic government should be made the minimum condition for membership and participation in the UN.
 A graded, time-bound programme for the transformation of authoritarian states should be drawn up by the UN in cooperation with concerned governments.
 The UN should provide assistance to nations in making the transition.
 2.A major UN Conference should be convened to examine UN institutional reform, including the composition and powers of both the Security Council and the General Assembly.

The orc roared in victory only to die as a soldier shoved his sword in his side and out his back.
 “Will they make it through?” Harruq asked, in awe of the display.
 Qurrah glanced over the wall and then back to the main combat.
 Archers continued eviscerating the orc forces.
 If they could push into the city, their arrows would be a nuisance at best, but it seemed they had underestimated the human soldiers.
 “They are running out of time,” Qurrah said.
 “But they might.”
 He glanced back to the necromancer, and then he saw his eyes, just hints of red underneath the hood of his robes.
 Qurrah shivered as whispers shot up his spine.
 _You silenced my pets,_ it said.

I harbored a suspicion that my writing career has always been stopped at the edge of a breakthrough by distracting worries, usually about family and finances.
 Most of all, I wanted to feel our marriage was, if not secure, then solid.
 In the beginning, we clashed in both measly and crucial ways.
 She slept late, I rose early.
 She was a vegan.
 And a poet, and poets often thrive on spontaneity while novelists require a heavy dose of routine, if we’re to finish those windy monsters.
 After a year, Pam returned to school.
 Two schools--Bethel Seminary for yet another Masters degree and U.C.
 Riverside for a PhD in Comparative Literature.
 And at those schools, when she met a new crowd of young folks just launching out toward their dreams, she wondered how much she had given up by marrying a fellow who already thought about retiring, which caused me to wonder in turn if I should I steel myself to prepare for another breakup?

 I wish we could, for Rachel's sake as well as yours, but it's just too risky.

 There are just too many of them for us to meet them in a stand-up fight and come out unscathed."
 I didn't like it.
 Mrs. Campbell was the only teacher who'd taken an active interest in my wellbeing, but I could see his point.
 I managed to do at least a passable job hiding my near frown as I nodded in acceptance.
 "Can I have just a few minutes today after school to tell her?"
 Alec's hand was warm on my face as he nodded.

But they'd no sooner begun browsing through the first shop than she began feeling panicky.
 She made herself look at dresses while her mother made her selections, but she wasn't paying attention.
 "I'm going to buy this one," Mrs. Tranton said, holding up a navy blue dress.
 "It's lovely."
 "Haven't you found anything you like?"
 "No."
 "Well, maybe next door."
 But once Mrs. Tranton had paid for her dress, Marie said, "Mother, do you mind if we go home?
 I'm not feeling well."
 "What's wrong, darling?"

He's just bought that piece of land I'd intended to use for a warehouse a few years ago."
 Daniel smiled at Marie, shaking the hand she'd extended.
 "It's nice to meet you, Miss Tranton."
 "Likewise, Mr.
 Lawson."
 "I'll have my lawyer send you the papers, Mr. Lawson," Jefferson Tranton said.
 He showed his guest out and then returned to kiss his daughter's cheek before sitting down behind his desk.
 "You look lovely this morning, my dear."
 "Thank you.

Everything went just like normal, and promptly at five I closed my binder and started stuffing books into my backpack.
 I looked up to find Rachel standing in front of my table.
 "Are you ready?
 James had to leave early, but don't worry, we've still got a ride home."
 I think I managed to keep the disappointment off of my face.
 Rachel at least didn't seem to notice.
 Somehow I'd lost track of the fact that it was a Wednesday, and Brandon therefore wouldn't be taking me home.
 "Great.
 Britney's been avoiding me like the plague.
 I didn't even see her leave today."

Over the past two decades the US economy lost nearly 4 million manufacturing jobs but added a net 37 million jobs through expansion of the service sector, which now accounts for 84 per cent of total employment.
 It is time that we stop resisting or resenting this trend, but rather strive to adapt by shifting our focus toward those fields of employment which are most directly stimulated by technological innovation.
 Export of commercial services already accounts for 20 per cent of world trade.
 The shift from manufacturing to services is a positive and inevitable expression of the elevation of human activity from the physical to the mental level, which is the central reason for the phenomenal rise in global living standards over the past century.
 Rich nations have become rich through a shift of workers from the primary farm sector to value-added, non-farm secondary and tertiary sectors.
 Poverty and hunger persist so long as a majority of the population depend upon the routine operations of farming for their livelihood.
 This is also the cause of the growing feminization of poverty in developing countries.
 Today’s developed nations arrived at their present position by a long, slow migration from agriculture to manufacturing to service sector, but that does not mean developing countries must follow the same path.
 The growing demand for services in the developed world coupled with rapid strides in telecommunications has created the possibility of skipping steps to abridge the development process.
 Even within developing countries, surging demand for education, health care, tourism, communication, financial and retail services has opened up opportunities that were available to the developed countries only at a much later stage in their development.

I turned away, still painfully unaccustomed to my new appearance, and tugged down the hem of the short leather top.
 Steed let out a whistle as I entered the main room.
 Ruby sat beside him, a warm smile on her face as if we were old friends.
 Chevelle was near a window on the front wall, leaning on one shoulder, his body turned toward me, expression impossible to read.
 “Better?” Ruby asked.
 “Yes, thank you.” I was polite, but it burned a little to thank her after what she’d done.
 Steed smiled, shaking his head from side to side with exaggerated slowness.
 “Some night.” He looked like he was trying to keep a secret.
 Heat crawled up my neck as I remembered climbing into his lap, and then again the second time I’d gotten out of bed.
 Ruby grinned at him conspiratorially.

Jim – I dunno, He hasn’t been in a good mood since he found dad’s porn collection.
 Liz – Your dad collects porn?
 Jim – Well, ‘collects’ is a bit too strong.
 He did manage to acquire a huge pile of it though.
 Liz – I can’t believe that your mom would allow too have that sort of thing in the house.
 Jim – She didn’t, the pile just seemed to appear about six months after she left.
 Then it started to multiply.
 I think he was making up for a lot of lost time.
 A lot of lost time.

The relaxation of tensions has drawn public attention away from this issue and reduced the momentum for progress at the very time when there is the greatest opportunity finally to eliminate this threat completely.
 The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which ensures the military superiority of the nuclear powers over other signatories, is an instance of rule by strength forcibly imposed by the major powers on the rest of the world community in the name of peace.
 It is neither equitable nor justifiable.
 Already, 156 countries have signed the treaty, owing either to coercion or indifference, and the number is expected to increase to 170 out of 179 states by 1995.
 The acceptance of non-proliferation by these countries further delegitimizes the continued possession of nuclear weapons by any country.
 All of the treaty non-signatories can be persuaded to sign in exchange for annihilation of these weapons by those that now possess them.
 Under these circumstances, refusal to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty could be considered sufficient grounds for expulsion from UN membership.
 Without a universal ban, the efforts of the nuclear powers to stop proliferation lack moral authority.
 Arguments are often advanced that nuclear weapons cannot be ‘dis-invented’, and that the danger of a rogue state or terrorist group acquiring and threatening use of these weapons necessitates that the present nuclear powers retain them for such a contingency.
 With the massive conventional firepower already available, nuclear weapons are not needed for defence, even against a rogue state with nuclear capability, and they do not represent a credible defence against terrorism under any circumstances.

Slowing my pace, I gave the surroundings more attention.
 The strangeness of the land was a little shocking, and I had to surrender the idea of finding a proper tree.
 But a half mile or so later, I came upon a suitable hollow in a low embankment guarded by the curling roots of a sycamore.
 It wasn’t a bad start, but I gathered some shrubbery to cover the entryway, the bitter stench of its sharp green leaves giving me a little more security—or at least the feeling of it.
 The sun hadn’t set when I’d finished lining the floor with vines, but I went ahead and settled in, sitting so I could see through an opening in the frond-covered entry.
 It was quiet, harder to fight the thoughts that were trying to creep in.
 I began to run songs through my head for distraction, mangling the lyrics and humming through the parts I couldn’t remember at all.
 My fingers tapped soundlessly into the dirt, until a flicker of movement just outside stopped me.
 I held my breath for what I was sure was impending, and painful, death, and saw it again.
 I released the breath, which was not, in fact, my last.

After a few minutes Rodregas got up and looked around for Imeralda.
 He saw that she was actually far out on another impossibly think branch.
 By the Infernals he swore to himself.
 She was a Forest Nymph.
 He thought he should just leave her there.
 She could do this far easier than he.
 Rodregas had an urge to leap from his branch to the other like a cat.
 Maybe he could have made it, but if he missed it was at least a hundred feet down.
 So he climbed the bark over to the other branch and then walked on the top, which was very easy.
 He followed Imeralda out on the branch until it started getting thin and began swaying.

"No, it isn't because he doesn't trust you.
 If he didn't trust you, he wouldn't have brought you here.
 He'd trust Isaac or Jasmin with his or even Rachel's life, but neither of them know about me.
 In fact, bringing you here expands the circle of people who know about me to a grand total of three.
 He trusts you, more than just trusts you, but he's right.
 There are a number of things you shouldn't know just yet."
 Mallory smiled again in response to my heavy sigh.
 "I know that must be hard to swallow.
 I'll tell you what.
 Go ahead and ask away, and if I think you should know the answer to any of your questions, I'll just tell you and devil take the consequences."

I probably would've spent the next few minutes refining my arguments for the next time we talked, but the last thing Britney had said finally sank in.
 His sister.
 Rachel was Alec's sister, and he hadn't made a move to save her.
 He hadn't even been willing to let his friends step in and stop the fight.
 I drifted off to History thinking that I would've done almost anything to save my sister.
 It would take a real heartless individual to abandon their own family.
 My anger buffered me just enough to think about Cindi without the usual consequences, but I still wasn't really in top form.
 I was halfway through my class before I realized Mr. Simms had been shooting me dark looks for the last twenty minutes.
 They weren't the obvious nasty looks that kids shoot each other of course.
 They were subtle and infrequent but there was something about the set of his mouth that made it clear he wasn't pleased I was in his class.

"Marie?"
 When she didn't respond, he leaned against the door, sliding to the floor.
 He dropped his head into his hands.
 How could he have done what he did?
 How could he put doubt in her mind about her fiancé and then-then .
 .
 .
 try to seduce her?
 He loved her and desperately wanted to make love to her, and her response to him was passionate and unrestrained.
 But she was confused--he knew that.

"If I ever really decide the outcome is a foregone conclusion, you'd better start watching out for your people.
 You'd be surprised just how many of them could disappear if I no longer worried about the consequences of my actions."
 The tingle of Alec's power lessened slightly once we were out of sight, but it still hadn't dropped off completely by the time we were standing in front of Mrs. Tiggs' classroom.
 I could still feel the faintest traces of his power long after he'd finally let my hand go with obvious reluctance and strode off, leaving Dominic and I to find our seats.
 ** The pack was more subdued than normal on the way home.
 Everyone splintered off into smaller component parts as soon as we passed the wrought-iron gate signaling the entrance to the Graves estate.
 Donovan was waiting patiently inside the door, but he took one look at the bristling bundle of energy that was Alec, and obviously revised his plans on the spot.
 "Shall I have dinner delayed, Master Alec, Mistress Rachel?"
 "I'll take mine later, Donovan, but please don't let that inconvenience the rest of the household.
 I'll be out in the garden if anyone needs me."

But onto other things well she always was a wonderful cook, with mushrooms and brownies being her specialties, we had those a lot, when there was enough to eat anyways.
 We were poor but happy, often mother would make us clothes out of flowers and stuff, they were colorful and pretty during the summer and they smelled real good.
 But when winter came we would be real cold and sometimes our clothes would fall off, which was real bad when we were away from home trying to make some money to help support us.
 Doctor – (really into drawing on one of the papers on the clipboard and not really paying attention)  (speaks periodically throughout Character 1’s monologue without looking up) Zat is very interesting!
 Fascinating!

 (notices the doctors obsession with the drawing)  Um what are you doing?
 Doctor – (startled) I am writing notes on your fascinating case, it’s a thing that we doctors do you know.
 Ya, we doctors write notes all the time, in fact I am writing them now.

I saw how you reacted to the ley line; you clearly have some power.” Doi’van tilted his head to me and said, “Really, do you think so?
 I do feel something now and then, but I have never been tested.
 People see me and how strong I am, they just assume I don’t have magic for some reason.” “Wish I had that problem,” Rodregas said.
 “I mean before, people always used to assume I had neither brawn nor brains.” With a smile he added, “What do you say?
 Shall the three of us set some time aside to teach each other what we know of magic and see what we can learn from these magic books of Ravenhurr’s?” he asked.
 “No,” said Doi’van.
 “I mean, yes, I would like to learn what you can teach me.
 I like to learn,” he said slowly but carefully.
 The big guy was embarrassed.
 Then he added, “I am afraid my people are not big readers, and, well, they saw me as half-monster and I never learned how to read.” The last words he added very slowly, but then quickly added, “But if you can teach me some basics from the oral techniques that Imeralda mentioned, I would like to learn some magic if I can.” Rodregas looked at Doi’van; there was something about his expression, a yearning.

Making ruckus.
 They didn’t have record contracts, they never made money.
 They played for fifty bucks a night, some beer, a little pussy.
 Early, early.
 There are names that aren’t even on the list, yet they made it all happen, for later cats, for B.
 B., for Furry, for Gatemouth.
 There’s this cat, Beaureguard somebody, played his whole life, man, his whole fucking life, lived in Midtown Memphis, played all the gigs there were back then—and we’re talking back in the Ur days, the days before electricity.
 And he lived to be, oh I don’t know, 117 or something ridiculous.
 Never made it, you know, never cut a record for Chess or whoever.
 But the music was important, it flowed through him, this cat.

Good night, good night, good night.
 For several years, I wrote a weekly column for the San Diego Reader.
 The nominal topic was people and their cars.
 One story was about Olga: Lately even George Bush talks of conservation and cutting our reliance on middle east oil.
 So I’m convinced it’s time we ask ourselves if living more like Olga Savitsky wouldn’t be preferable to the way we are living.
 Olga is a minimalist.
 Though plenty educated (holding a Master of City Planning degree) and able to follow a more lucrative career, she chooses to work cleaning houses.
 She shares an apartment and pays less than $400 for rent and utilities, in a pleasant neighborhood near a commercial district.
 On most of her errands, she can walk.
 When she needs to drive, she uses her 1994 Toyota Tercel.

It seemed they were tailored for me.
 I’d never had such luck making my own clothes.
 These were trim and fit, made for traveling.
 Not that I knew where I was going.
 My desire to trail Chevelle had been smashed, but there was no way I could return to the village.
 I glanced around.
 Still no sign of the watchers as I slid my shoes on.
 I should have kept running during the night, but I’d been too exhausted.
 There was a pack in the pile as well, but I didn’t have anything aside from a soaking wet dress.
 I stretched it over a low branch to dry, and the pouch I had hidden before the trial fell free.

I went straight for the shotgun then marched back down the icy sidewalk telling myself I would only shoot the Polish guy.
 A block short of the clubhouse, Tony met me.
 By the time I finished telling my plan and reasons, the rage had waned just enough so I let him have the gun.
 A few days later, Bob and I caught a ride out of Albany, Georgia with a slick young man named Johnny.
 His blond hair was oiled and wavy.
 He wore a silk shirt and drove a fast, red convertible.
 Though he claimed to have gotten out of prison only yesterday, he blazed at about twice the speed limit down Highways 19 and 41 into Florida and all the way to Miami.
 He talked about money, women, and other stuff he’d missed while in prison.
 When he asked if we would be looking for work in Miami and we said probably, he nodded and chucked my arm.
 “Hey, the boss will set you up.” The boss lived in a palace on a canal.

I decided to go check on him.
 I realized I was running.
 As I rounded a corner heading to the practice rooms, I ran into something hard.
 The impact didn’t knock me down, but the shock almost did.
 It was one of Father’s guards… one of the guards he’d taken with him.
 He had me by the arm, dragging me along before I could think.
 I couldn’t decide whether to run, whether to fight.
 And then we were in the throne room.
 My father’s face was indescribable, his fury almost tangible.
 I couldn’t bring myself to look away from him, but I saw Rune standing in my peripheral vision.

Marie watched him leave and then, with a sigh, rose and went to the living room, still wearing her 1927 clothes.
 She’d tried so hard to get back this morning.
 She’d worn only her 1927 clothes, and her mind hadn’t wandered to 2011 at all.
 What more could she do?
 Well, one thing she wasn’t going to do was give up, she determined as she played with the hem of her dress.
 She’d strolled through her garden countless times without walking into 2011, so who knew how many times she’d have to walk in the garden to get back to 1927?
 She wasn’t going to give up.
 Rick, still concerned about Marie, left work at 4:30, making a quick stop to pick up a surprise for her.
 To his dismay, he found her huddled in a corner of the sofa, still wearing her 1927 clothes.
 “Hi, sweetheart,” he greeted her, going to sit beside her.

Another quick shift and they were stumbling down that same hill.
 The cold hand vanished.
 The cloud dissipated.
 Before him, standing with his arms crossed, waited Velixar.
 Qurrah stunned his brother by falling to one knee and bowing his head.
 “Greetings, master,” Qurrah said.
 “I have brought him as you asked.”
 Delighted, Velixar grinned as he surveyed the tall, muscular half-orc.
 As with Qurrah, he saw the untapped potential, incredible strength, and skill waiting for a purpose to harness it.
 The subtle shift of Velixar’s features slowed as he approached.

I tried to distract myself as we rode east around the lake, attempting to name the species of plants as Junnie might have made me, but there were so many I had never seen that it started to remind me of the difference rather than distract me from it.
 So I bantered with Steed regarding horses and imps and everything I could come up with to keep him talking.
 Chevelle rode quietly behind us, scanning our surroundings.
 I wasn’t sure if he was enjoying the scenery or playing lookout.
 We rode a few days into the base of the mountains.
 We had stopped to camp when, over dinner, Steed announced he would be leaving us the next morning, heading east.
 His easy humor had become a comfort to me during the long days, our quiet evenings a pattern I knew I would miss.
 The disappointment must have shown on my face.
 He reached a hand up and brushed my hair behind an ear.
 “Don’t worry, sunshine, I will see you again.” I smiled a little and he winked at me.

I had never even thought to check there.
 Brandon stood up.
 Bryce glared into Brandon’s eyes, and in the room’s dead silence Bryce laid the drugs and the burned black-sketched foil on the counter like it was a dead animal.
 I stood in front of Brandon, looking slightly up at him, as he is taller than me.
 The room was silent and everyone awestruck.
 After what we just went through with him… I looked Brandon in his guilty darkened eyes and I said, “Prepare yourself to find out what will happen to you every time you lie to me… are you ready?” Before he could reply or even contemplate my words, I felt the crack of Brandon’s nose on my knuckles and he flew backwards off his feet.
 My family’s loud simultaneous gasps accompanied Harry and Bryce’s rush to restrain me as if I was going to continue the beating.
 Maybe kill Brandon.
 This is how angry we all were.
 How out of our element.

Qurrah motioned to the building housing the archers.
 “Go inside.
 I will distract them.”
 “You sure?”
 “Yes, now go!”
 Harruq kicked open the barricaded door and then barged up the stairs.
 Qurrah withdrew a few pieces of bone from a pouch.
 He tightened his grip about them, whispering a few words of magic as he did.
 Then he looked to the window.
 He could barely see a bow and part of a hand.

I mean, I was about five and my parents had this set of records, this Reader’s Digest set, and there was this one song that I fell in love with on it, used to go around the house, scatting it, at five.
 It was “I Can’t Get Started” by Bunny Berigan.
 I don’t know.
 I can still play that one.
 CM:  	So, you grew up in a musical house?
 Music was part of your everyday life?
 BG:  	(laughs) Shit, no.
 Why would that follow?
 I mean, we had this console thing, whatever the hell they called them, big as a basilisk, a monstrous thing that had a radio and record player.
 I used to lie on the couch in the dark and listen to FM 100 on that thing—my parents, well, if they thought about what I was doing at all, probably thought it was better than TV.

At last, Harruq forced him back, and in the brief opening he spun his sword around and buried half the blade into the orc’s gut.
 The orc gasped something unintelligible, dropped his other sword, and fell limp.
 Harruq stared at the body, his hands shaking from the excitement and his breath thunderous in his ears.
 A hand touched his shoulder.
 He recoiled as if struck.
 “Well done,” Qurrah said, his eyes locked on the corpse.
 Harruq recognized that look.
 His brother had seen something he wanted, and he would have it.
 “A strong life and a fresh death.”
 “The battle?” Harruq asked.

Liz – Wait a minute, does that make the two of you brothers now?
 Jim – I guess.
 Eugene – What do you mean you guess?
 Either he told you or he didn’t.
 Jim – I mean I guess we’re brothers, Art did tell me.
 Eugene – Wow, brothers.
 I’ve never had a brother.
 Liz – Neither have I, Jim, do you think Art will adopt me too?
 I’d like to have a brother.
 Jim – Johnny.

Jim – Johnny, do you still have mom’s note?
 Johnny – What do you mean?
 Jim – I mean the letter she wrote us before she left.
 The one that we were all the spawn of Satan and that she felt corrupted by being related to us.
 The one that she said…
 Johnny – To my family.
 I despise the day that Arthur asked me to marry him.
 I despise myself for ever happily agreeing.
 Obviously I was blinded to the truth, but now I it, as my father had always insisted.
 My biggest failure in life was not having listened to his wise words.

 Art finally sees Liz and approaches her.
 Liz – Jim, you need to seek help.
 Jim – Probably, but I won’t.
 Art – Excuse me Liz, but have you seen Jim about here?
 Jim – (In a silly accent) No sir, there has been nobody named Jim here.
 Art – Son, those glasses suit you, they hide that ugly mug of yours quite well.
 Jim – Since these are your glasses it must be an inherited family curse to be so homely.
 Art – My boy, indeed it is, and if the world is lucky you won’t ever have children and pass on our cursed genes.

"If I hadn't asked you, if I'd just gone on kissing you and touching you, we would have made love.
 You wouldn't have stopped me."
 This time she did blush.
 "You're probably right."

World peace and prosperity in the coming decades will depend on our willingness boldly to confront this issue.
 At the end of the Second World War the victorious nations joined together to found the UN.
 At the end of the Cold War, the organization needs to be re-founded, and restructured according to democratic principles, to give a more active role and more equitable representation to people of all nations.
 To deem such considerations unrealistic given the present alignment of power in the world is a short-sighted view.
 It ignores the incredible speed and scope of changes that have radically transformed international relations over the past half decade.
 It assumes that the present system has the backing of the international community and that it can and will sustain itself regardless of whatever steps we may contemplate.
 A fundamental change in structure is essential and inevitable.
 The break-up of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War have resulted in the demise of the bipolar system which dominated international relations after 1945.
 The United States is now recognized as the sole superpower and the primary determinant of actions by the UN Security Council.
 But neither America’s culture nor its historical economic and political development and present outlook will permit it to take on the extraordinary responsibilities and overseas commitments which fulfilment of this role necessitates, as its reluctance to get involved in Bosnia and Rwanda, and its quick withdrawal from Somalia illustrate.

He felt her breath, the quivering of her lips.
 He kissed the corner of her mouth and nuzzled her cheek.
 Gathering her closer, he began taking her lips in one soft kiss after another.
 But as her response grew warmer, his kisses became hungrier.
 Marie was growing hot and felt almost drugged by Rick's kisses.
 She ran one hand over his chest, wishing that his shirt had buttons so that she could undo one and slip her hand inside.
 If--oh!
 The tip of Rick's tongue was touching her lower lip.
 But she wasn't repulsed.
 Rick had said he'd never hurt her .

I think most women probably want to be more like you.

 Jim – I just call them as I see them.

 Jim – You do that, I’ll start looking for the number that pizza parlor uptown.

 Jim – (To himself out loud) Well, at least I caught it on the first bounce, I could have gotten into much trouble had I missed a chance to drop a complement.

 Eugene – Ok, this time I’m going to crush you!

“You know, Ruby told me she’d had dealings with the infamous Chevelle Vattier, but I didn’t believe her.
 One can never believe the tales of a fairy.” Infamous?
 “But imagine my surprise when he walked out of the trees, following a green-eyed beauty.” Steed smiled at the memory and then turned serious.
 “When I ran into the… trackers, I had hope Ruby had told the truth and might know where to find you.” He laughed.
 “She tried to hide you, but I recognized the horses out front.” “She tried to hide us?” “Ah, yes.
 Fairies are full of treacheries and wickedness.
 Always meddling in the affairs of others, causing trouble whenever possible.
 They have quite a time.
 At least Red’s only half wicked.” His sister.
 I was having trouble wrapping my mind around it all.

Art – What for?
 It happened several years ago.
 Karen –I didn’t mean to drudge up old pain.
 Art - Ah, it still does hurt a little.
 It’s not often that your wife of fifteen years tells you that she hates you and you’re going to hell, and the on top of that goes to become a Nun.
 Karen – I shouldn’t have been so nosey.
 Art – Bah, it’s ok, I enjoy talking to you, besides it could have been worse.
 Karen – How could have it gotten worse than that?
 Art – She could have told me that I was evil incarnate and that I turned her into a lesbian.
 I don’t know how long it would have taken to have gotten over that.

 “Pachuko Hop.” The Airplane’s “Plastic Fantastic Lover.” “How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria.” (laughs) I’m doing “Elusive Butterfly” with the Stone Canyon Band.

I'd tried to get both Rachel and Dominic to explain why she hated me so much, but neither would give me a real explanation.
 Rachel would always just get mad and say there was no excuse for how Jess was acting.
 Dominic always refused to say anything other than that Jessica had been through her own set of struggles, and had her reasons for her behavior.
 "I'll be done with Dom in just a moment, Jess, then I'll fix your hair while Rachel finishes up with Adri."
 The nickname should have hurt, but somehow it wasn't as bad when the pack used it.
 It was almost like having a new family, one without all of the grief-poisoned memories that popped up every time I really thought about Dad or Cindi.
 Faster than I would've believed possible, we were all in our dresses, and waiting in the living room for the boys to make their appearance.
 Jasmin and Rachel had worked what I was pretty sure was actual magic.
 Even Jessica was nothing less than stunning, and I didn't look as bad as normal.
 Jasmin's backless black dress and shoulder-length gloves had streaks of blue that brought out her eyes, while Dominic's tight, red gown seemed to give her the confidence and poise you'd expect from someone so gorgeous and utterly exotic.

I thought about taking a second bottle, but they were too expensive to pour down a sink, and I knew I wouldn't be hungry enough to finish up the first, let alone a second meal.
 The tinny blare of a car horn pulled me out the front door.
 Britney was waiting outside with her heater going full blast.
 I was surprised at how cold it was with the sun still struggling to get above the mountains.
 Of course it wasn't cold enough for me to need a heater, but I also wasn't wearing Britney's shorts, which looked like they were even shorter than the ones she'd worn the day before.
 It was amazing what the administration was letting everyone get away with.
 Of course, if I had legs like some of these girls, I'd probably be joining in.
 Britney turned down her rap music just long enough to say "Hi", and then we were off to school.
 The music was fairly hideous, but it did spare me having to try and be friendly before I was fully awake.
 Of course it also stopped me from digging further into the mystery of why it was so dangerous to hike.

He slumped after his surrender, confident the worst was over.
 I reached the sword tip back to his leg and made another incision to release the snake.
 It jerked and coiled free of the wound, flicking blood over the tracker’s pristine white robe.
 Behind me, a low voice ordered, “Kill him.” I glanced down at the sword, still in my hand.
 The sword I was supposed to take someone’s head off with.
 I didn’t know who the order had been intended for, but it wasn’t me.
 This man was going to die.
 I knew he didn’t have more than a moment before their magic broke him.
 They would take his life because he was after us.
 After me.

The potion tilted enough so that half spilled down his throat.
 With the pain so unbearable, he dared not cough against the liquid that came burning down.
 Some of it went into his lungs, but he kept them still.
 Qurrah reclined, closed his eyes, and let the potion do its work.
 He could feel the magic flowing through his body, concentrating about his ruined throat.
 Part of him hoped the liquid would heal the damage done so many years ago, but he knew better.
 A scar that old was beyond repair.
 He would have to settle for surviving.
 That was just fine with him.
 When he finally dared a loud, gasping breath of air, the pain was not so bad.

“Aurry?” he asked.
 “You said most elves remember when men were created…‌do you know how orcs were made?”
 The elf looked at him.
 She was trying to read him, Harruq could tell, but he endured it without protest.
 “When Ashhur and Karak warred, there were elves that sought to end it,” she said.
 “Against Celestia’s orders, they joined Karak, hoping their aid would finally end the conflict.
 When our goddess imprisoned the two gods, she cursed those elves.
 She stripped them of their beauty, their intelligence, and their long life.
 They weren’t evil, Harruq, but Karak offered them strength and they accepted it.
 The dark god drove them to war against elves and men.

I'd almost backed out when Alec told me we'd be taking his bullet bike, but I didn't want him to know I really was a complete wuss.
 All of which explained how I'd ended up on Alec's shiny, blue Yamaha R1 with my arms locked around him in a death grip.
 Apparently I'd given away at least some of my fear though, because Alec took the first half of our forty-minute drive at a positively sedate pace, or at least what qualified as a sedate pace on a machine that could go from zero to sixty much faster than any of the exotic sports cars Alec and his friends usually drove.
 Just as I finally started to enjoy leaning with Alec while zipping around turns at what I was starting to suspect were triple digit speeds, he pulled off behind a ramshackle, old building and held a finger to his lips.
 I held my breath and tried my best to try and figure out what he was listening for, but encased as I was by the blue helmet he'd insisted on, I would've been lucky to notice if a herd of elephants had been hot on our trail.
 Several seconds passed, and then Alec smiled at me again and backed the bike into the building, which was every bit as decrepit-looking on the inside as it'd been on the outside.
 "Are we here?"
 "Disappointed?"
 I felt my skin heat up again, but managed to stick my tongue out.
 "No, we're not quite there yet, but before we continue on, I need your promise not to discuss this with anyone.

Western European unemployment rates are at the highest level in 30 years.
 They are projected soon to reach 12 per cent or 18 million people and remain high throughout the decade, prompting the outgoing European Union President, Jacques Delors, to call employment Europe’s ‘Achilles heel’.
 Youth unemployment rates (aged 16–19) in the European Community average nearly 20 per cent and nearly 50 per cent of the unemployment is long-term (more than one year).
 The emerging situation poses a challenge to the European concept of the welfare state.
 Employment in Eastern Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union has been severely disrupted by the break-up of COMECON, the dissolution of the USSR and the movement of these countries from centrally planned to market economies.
 From the beginning of 1990 to March 1992, registered unemployment grew from 100,000 to over 4 million and it has continued to rise steeply since then.
 The unemployment rate for ten Eastern European countries now averages around 17 per cent.
 Recent projections indicate that jobless ness in Russia could reach 15 million persons or 18 per cent of the work-force in the near future.
 By far the most serious problem lies in the developing world, where unemployment rates average 40–50 per cent in many countries.
 In Latin America, 192 million people representing 46 per cent of the population live under the poverty line, and 22 per cent of them are considered ‘extremely poor’.

Some of my fondest memories are of the days I got to watch him golf competitively.
 Such a fine young man and a great sport; win or lose, he shows class and dignity.
 Brandon eventually lost his interest in youth sports and had no interest in golf.
 He did, however, love hot rods.
 He was intrigued by my high school hot rod so we found the same make, model and year of car in horrible condition.
 The only positive comment Lisa could make was, “at least it runs.” I taught both of my boys to drive a stick shift on this beat up Chevelle before my eldest and I began to take it completely apart in an attempt to restore this classic car to its original condition with a hot rod twist.
 The deeper we dug into it, the more rust and damage we found.
 There were so many holes rusted through the bottom we could see the garage floor through the trunk.
 We removed every wire, rubber seal, window felt, and had boxes full of zip-lock baggies that were marked with a Sharpie what the part was and where it had come from.
 When Brandon was about fifteen, we went to Hot August Nights in Reno, a huge hot rod auto show.

Chasing them the whole while were twin sets of tracks, one of enormous weight, the other light as a feather.
 “Every one of them,” he said, his hand clutching his bow so tight his knuckles were whiter than the moon.
 “They slaughtered even those that fled.
 Yet there are no corpses.”
 The corpses had been taken.
 Or made to walk again.
 “The man with infinite faces,” Dieredon concluded.
 Another thought came to him.
 “Or was it you, Qurrah Tun?”
 He raced back to Woodhaven, his mind decided.

You're most welcome for whatever small part I might have played in helping events to unfold as they would have in a perfect world.
 My actions were not such as to merit any large boon from you, but still I must ask one.
 Please never show this note to anyone.
 I ask not for myself, but for the others such knowledge could affect.
 I hope your circumstances continue on much as they are now, but on the chance they do not, I can be reached by leaving a note in the hollow of the lightning-struck tree half a mile to the east of your house.
 --@ Chapter 15 My alarm pulled me out of the strangest night of sleep I'd ever experienced.
 Maybe I'd just been overtired, or possibly the strange, symbol on the note, inked into the place where a signature normally would've been, had reminded me of the other truly alien experience so far in my life.
 Whatever the reason, it felt like I'd spent all night on the edge of one of the incredible, vivid dreams.
 I kept catching glimpses of the characteristic soft glow out of the corner of my eye, but hadn't ever actually slipped into a full-blown dream.
 It'd left me feeling very unsatisfied.

It had a tail and curled around the branch so it could rest its middle.
 Emily watched it and its beauty; she didn't think that something this pretty could be found in a place so dark and full of death.
 “Hello,” it said.
 Emily propped herself up on her elbow.
 “Hi, what are you?” “An augothas.” it replied and fluttered its wings.
 “Are you a half-ling?” “Yes, how did you know?
 Is it that obvious?” The augothas seemed to cock its head.
 “Well you can't be a faery because you don't have the ears and you can't be a pixie because they're always giggling around.
 How can you understand me?” Emily shrugged.

I'd settled in for a long trip, only to realize as we crossed the state line that Jasmin was positively shattering the speed limit.
 I managed to limit myself to a single gulp, when I saw just how fast she was going, but everyone else was so relaxed that I finally managed to unclench my fists and join back in the conversation.
 It helped that the Mercedes was so smooth, and that I knew Jasmin had reflexes and reaction time that would've made any Indy racer insanely jealous.
 Apparently there wasn't a single cop on duty, because we made it into downtown Vegas in what I was sure was record time.
 It had to be.
 Jasmin hadn't dropped below triple digits until we were less then fifteen minutes from exiting the interstate.
 It wasn't until we hit the first store that I started to get an idea of what Donovan had been hinting at.
 The shyness Rachel normally exhibited at school was replaced by supreme confidence the moment we crossed the threshold of the first store.
 Armani, Versace, Prada, we conducted a tour de force of them all along with others whose names I didn't even recognize.
 The shopping trip was ostensibly for me, but Rachel cajoled both Jasmin and Dominic into dressing rooms on more than one occasion.

Amazingly, I walked right up to the one with an arrow on it.
 I looked to the left and saw a door with a sword on it.
 I sighed and pushed open my door.
 The small room also had glass ceilings but they were dimmer.
 The room was dark and cold, with dust in the air.
 “I was wondering when you would get here,” a familiar voice said.
 I jumped and looked into one of the corners.
 The girl from my dreams walked out, shimmering.
 She smiled and I then noticed the bow hanging on her back with a quiver of arrows.
 “You know how you asked for my name before?

*** “Hurry up Jason, you’re so slow!” Emily yelled at him.
 Jason walked the rest of the way up the hill and bent over to catch his breath.
 “We've been walking all day and you're not tired?” “Nope, I've got dancer muscles.” Jason sat on the ground.
 “Well, I have artist muscles and those are in my hands.” Emily rolled her eyes.
 “Then walk on your hands.” “No way!” he said.
 “Fine, then don't complain.” She climbed into a small tree that was near the cliff she had spotted.
 She leaned back and let out a sigh of relief.
 Her legs were killing her but she wasn't going to tell Jason that.
 He got up and sat at the base of the tree.
 “You had to take the good tree?” She motioned around.

"Are you sure?"
 "Yeah.
 I-I must be the key.
 The-the door or whatever must open when I think about 1927."
 “But why would you be the reason?” “I—“  He cleared his throat.
 “I-I read an article about you.
 Before you walked into my garden.” “An article about me?” “Yeah.
 You and your family.
 A group Teri works with threw a 1920s party, and she gave me a book about the 1920s.
 There was a section about you.” “What did it say?” “It had information about your father and his business and how he disinherited your brother.

 Had you ever done that before?” “No.”  He shrugged.
 “I was really lonely and falling in love with a girl in a book.
 Maybe God decided to take mercy on me.” “Oh, Rick.”  Her eyes filled with tears.
 “I’ve fallen in love with you too.
 But I have to go back.”  She sniffed, reaching out to squeeze his wrists.

Hell, I’m still sorry.
 CM: 	But you got off the junk.
 BG:  	I—(garbled)—yeah, I mean, yeah.
 CM:  	Did you come back from Arkansas revitalized, renewed?
 BG:  	Naw, it wasn’t that simple.
 I mean, Lorelei reached down into the cosmic soup and pulled me out.
 But I was still a mess, you know?
 I was wrung out, without hope or talent or release.
 I was limp, like a rope, see, like a rope that formerly held such tension, then snapped—I was that rope.
 I was weak as a bled calf.

"How did it happen?
 What brought things between Brandon and our Alec to a head?"
 "It was my fault.
 I'd been dating Brandon, and we went to a party.
 Only while we were there he tried to do things I wasn't comfortable with.
 When I told him no, he--they--threw me out and told me to find my own way home."
 It was harder to relate the story than I'd expected, but Mallory's cluck of disapproval over Brandon's actions helped a little.
 It made me hope that maybe she wasn't going to hate me for bringing ruin to Alec and the others.
 "I was stumbling in the dark when Simon and Nathanial came for me, only I didn't know it was them, I just saw two enormous wolves running me down.
 If Alec hadn't stopped them I think they probably would've killed me."

Make love?
 All she knew was that she wanted more of Rick--more of his kisses and his touches.
 She felt like she couldn't get enough.
 All at once she realized that getting enough meant making love.
 She would have blushed if her entire body weren’t already on fire.
 Rick wasn't her husband.
 And he never would be.
 For that reason, she shouldn't make love with him .

Kojas isn't going to get a chance to use you because he's going to have to get through me first.” “And me,” Emily added.
 “Don't count me out.” I stood up and faced Seth with Emily and Jason.
 “And he's going to have to get through me too.” Seth smiled and stood up.
 He sighed in relief.
 “Well, that's a load off.” “I don't know whether I should be mad at you for not telling us or be happy that we're all on the same page,” Emily said thoughtfully.
 “But you better not keep anything else from us or Kojas won't be your problem.” She winked at him and set off with Jason on her heels.
 I think they were going to start arguing about the water war.
 “Great job Seth!” I said and hugged him.
 His eyes seemed to widen in surprise but he didn't tell me to get off.
 I pulled away, blushed, and started to follow Emily's tracks.

Marie immediately pushed herself up and over to lie on top of him, her mouth claiming his again.
 He couldn't help returning her kiss, but when she began kissing his neck, he croaked, "Sweetheart, please stop."
 She paused for just a second.
 But then she ran her hand over his chest, nibbling on his earlobe as she whispered, "I don't think I can."
 He groaned again.
 It had taken all the strength he had to make himself stop.
 If she kept kissing him, no power on earth, no amount of love or guilt would be able to make him stop.
 "Marie," he began, his voice cracking, "do you want to make love?"
 She froze.
 Make love?

He flexed his arm and stared at the growth that traveled all the way up to his neck.
 He felt within himself a lifewell of energy, one infinitely deep.
 “Discard your swords, Harruq,” Velixar said.
 “You are the protector of my disciple.
 You deserve better.”
 He slid his two swords out from their sheaths, stunned by the ease in which he moved them.
 It was if they went from being made of steel to air.
 He tossed them aside.
 Velixar pulled from within his cloak a chest the size of a small stone.
 He placed it on the grass where it shone gold in the light of the stars.

 And you didn’t even get any drugs this time.
 Oh the things I have to go through to keep you sane.
 Where are you?

 (wanders around stage looking for Character 1 until she finds him behind the couch)
 Character 1- (Jumps up upon being found and trys to leap over the couch to escape) I didn’t do anything, the doctor was a lunatic.
 He/She spoke with a fake German accent for no reason, and didn’t let me see the notes that he/she was taking.
 I don’t feel much better at all, but I did get to talk about mommy, she’s such a saint.

Rodregas thought the other guard was going to laugh out loud at his comment.
 As a senior guard familiar with the impending ceremony, the fellow damned well knew that neither prisoner would be worrying about food within the hour.
 Rodregas groaned to himself as the group picked up the pace on the tower steps.
 Over the last few years, his right knee acted up whenever he mounted stairs.
 That, of course, was just one of many complaints advanced years bestowed upon him.
 How ironic that the young prisoners were on their way to die, when old useless men like him, and scumbag fellow guards, continued to live.
 He suppressed a shiver of excitement at the notion that this time will be different.
 This time, he would not just cry out to the gods about the injustice while innocent people burned.
 He filled his lungs with stale air tainted with burning pitch and tried to sink into the mindless guard mentality that kept him functioning for the past decade and a half.
 Once a man loses all hope of a decent life, it is astonishing what he will do to stay alive.

Somehow I willed myself to stick it out at school despite my surroundings and the influences of my peers.
 I don’t know what it was that enabled me to do this, to not fall entirely into the wasteland of addiction and entitlement.
 Biology?
 Character?
 It’s inexplicable, really.
 All of my roommates had dropped out of high school but somehow I continued; although my grades sucked, they were passing grades.
 In my senior year I only took classes until noon because that is all I needed to graduate.
 I got another job at a local restaurant for the lunch shift as well as any days I was off from the grocery store.
 I realized at an early age that nobody was going to give me anything and if I wanted something I would need to earn it.
 If I didn’t succeed, I wouldn’t survive!

"With shape shifters, we believe it's because the animating energy, the soul if you will, burns more brightly than normal.
 I think it's tied in with what allows us to shift forms.
 With you, there isn't any obvious reason, but I think that Dominic has probably hit upon the root of the matter."
 His pause this time wasn't just to collect his thoughts; I could tell he was tempted not to tell me whatever he was thinking.
 "You know that our legends indicate a belief we were created in order to watch over and protect humans?
 Well, Dominic believes that your light represents a defense mechanism.
 We don't know of any accounts where humans have burned so brightly, but it's possible the primitive parts of you, the ones that remember what it was like to be watched over by our kind, hit upon a way to call for help from us, while not admitting a problem to your own kind."
 He was being so vague that it took me several seconds to follow the explanation to its logical conclusion.
 "So you're saying that I was, am, so broken I glow so your people would be able to pull me aside and fix me."
 His nod was hesitant, but my wan smile seemed to reassure him somewhat.

The process was so smooth, I couldn’t say exactly what had happened.
 Chevelle was changing.
 Or, more likely, he was becoming more himself.
 He wasn’t as formal.
 He seemed relaxed, and apparently magic, quick and powerful, was intertwined into his every routine.
 He didn’t need to do much by hand; I would have spent hours trying to build a spit and skin an animal.
 An old question came back to me and I asked, “How do you hunt?” “Hmm?” “You don’t have a bow,” I explained.
 “What do you use to hunt?” He hesitated, as if deciding what to tell me.
 “I use magic, Frey.” He looked like he was waiting for me to be upset.
 “Oh.” I contemplated his answer.

“The men are ready, milord,” Sergan said.
 “Do we march?”
 Antonil stared at the small town, seeing very little motion within.
 No people wandered the streets.
 No traveling merchants hawked their wares.
 He sighed and turned to Sergan, his trusted advisor in war.
 The man was old, scarred, and had dirty hair falling down to his shoulders.
 He had seen many wars, and the axe against his shoulder had claimed more than a few lives.
 “Yes, let us end this, one way or the other,” Antonil said.
 “Order them to march.

While the number of nuclear missiles and bombs has been dramatically reduced, both the USA and Russia retain thousands of such weapons.
 The number of nuclear weapons states has increased and the threat of first use has been extended to Israel, the Indian subcontinent and the Korean peninsula.
 South Africa and some former Soviet republics have voluntarily relinquished their claims as nuclear weapons states.
 Few realize that the catastrophic damage caused by the atomic bombing of Japan at the end of World War II dwindles into insignificance when compared with the destructive power and radioactive fall-out that would result from the explosion of even the smallest nuclear device today.
 Until the last nuclear weapon has been destroyed, the threat of accidental or intentional usage remains very real and very serious.
 The nuclear weapon states must come forward to fulfil the commitments made in the non-proliferation treaties by taking active and immediate steps leading to total nuclear disarmament by all powers within the shortest possible time.
 Year 2005, which is the 60th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, presents a real opportunity for concrete steps toward eradication of nuclear stockpiles.
 Cooperative Security System: Ten years ago the Commission was adamant in its call for a fundamental shift from a competitive to a cooperative global security system.
 The present competitive system depends on the ability of each individual nation to defend its own borders and interests against external threats.
 Such a system necessarily demands massive investments by each country in military capabilities.

“Well, you ready to go, little elfie?” he said, trying act gruff.
 “Of course.” Aurelia retrieved her staff, smiling to herself.
 The offer flattered her more than Harruq could know.
 “Well,” Aurelia said, twirling her staff.
 “Ready for a go?”
 “Oh yeah,” Harruq said, drawing his swords.
 “You’ve got no idea.”
 But she did, and it made her laugh all the more.

“She also told me not to go into the shadows.” Seth stretched.
 “So the usual confusion?” “I got more this time, Seth.
 Anyway, do you have any information to offer here?” I asked with an edge to my voice.
 Seth put his arms in surrender.
 “Hey, don't start yelling at me.
 We were getting a long pretty well last night, let's keep it that way.” I felt my face flush when I remembered last night.
 “Yes, you're right.” I was eager to change the subject so I said, “Are you going to tell them when they wake up?” “Yes I will, Jazell.
 I promised.” I sighed in relief.
 “Good...” I heard a loud yawn and Emily stretched her arms in the air.
 She stood up and walked the couple of feet over to me and stopped.

Whenever she showed a friend a picture of her gorgeous brother, the girl would immediately ask to be set up.
 But Rick had refused every time.
 She hoped that getting him to commit to the benefit dance would at least force him to ask someone out.
 She knew he was lonely, and she couldn’t stand seeing him shut himself off from any prospect of a relationship.
 Rick would probably have refused to go if he hadn’t met Sharon this weekend.
 He didn’t feel particularly attracted to her, but she was a nice girl, and that was a big improvement over his last few experiences.
 That evening he went out to the garden with the book Teri had given him.
 Sharon had been enthusiastic about the dance when he’d called to invite her.
 He’d told her he’d lend her the book, but she said that she already had some ideas about finding a drop-waist dress and a cloche hat.
 Personally, he thought the clothes were rather ugly.

It was too late to hide; I might as well at least have something decent to eat.
 Its smell was unfamiliar, but I didn’t care.
 It smelled like food.
 He reached down and tore a hunk from the spit, tossing it to me with a wink.
 When I blushed, he smiled a wicked smile.
 My mouth went dry.
 He was tall and broad with dark hair and eyes.
 Like Chevelle.
 Handsome too, I supposed, though I could tell even from these few gestures he was a bit cocky.
 He reminded me of Evelyn, always so proud of herself for finding me out.

Alec wasn't talking, but from the way he was scanning the room, he didn't want to be there anymore than the rest of them.
 I made it to Brandon's table, and was still pulling my meal replacement drink out of my bag when the loudspeaker clicked on with the obligatory burst of static.
 "This is Principal Gossil and I've got an exciting announcement.
 The school is sponsoring a trip to Las Vegas to see the production of Les Misérables that just started.
 Tickets are available at a discounted rate in the office for the next two days."
 It was like someone had rifled through my mind to pick out my biggest disappointment in recent days, pulled it out and rubbed salt on the wound before cramming it back inside me.
 Of course I'd go see how big of a discount the school had gotten the tickets at, but it was extremely unlikely my tiny check would end up being enough.
 It took me a moment to realize Mr. Gossil hadn't ended his announcement.
 "...those wishing to be entered into the drawing should stop by the office between today and noon tomorrow."
 In the face of the near-universal apathy expressed by the rest of the student body, it took my mind several seconds to process exactly what had been said.

His neck looked so warm and inviting.
 She wanted to bury her face in the crook of his neck and shoulder.
 Did he like being kissed on the neck as much as she did?
 Just the memory of his kisses made her heart race.
 They had coffee and dessert in the living room.
 "What a pretty sculpture," Marie said, admiring a small porcelain garden filled with flowers and a water wheel.
 "Clap your hands," Teri told her.
 "What?"
 "Clap your hands."
 Marie did so, and music played as water began to make the water wheel turn.

I didn’t share her enthusiasm, so I retired to my room and read more of the journal.
 There were many sad passages after the passing of the writer’s mother, though their bond didn’t seem traditional.
 It seemed more… formal.
 And there were many complaints about the additional workload, both with the castle duties—which were described in more detail—and her training.
 I couldn’t be sure how much time had passed without the entries being dated, but her mood had definitely shifted.
 Father has been merciless in my practice and testing with Rune.
 Unrelenting sessions are wearing on me.
 I can barely concentrate.
 I don’t have the energy for the simplest tasks, let alone the new and wild trials he’s created.
 He thinks he has to test every possible idea he has or else he won’t know what I might be capable of.

I wasn't about to pry if there was something she didn't want to tell me.
 "I guess that's fair.
 Let me know if you have any more questions."
 Rachel nodded, and then turned back to her book, apparently having used up her store of courage for the afternoon.
 I stopped by Britney's desk to ask if she needed any help, and had to avoid an attempt to suck me into another gripe session about Mrs. Campbell.
 Satisfied that there wasn't anything I needed to be doing to help either of the other girls, and that they'd let me know if that changed, I broke out my Spanish book and reviewed some more vocabulary.
 Despite my growing hatred for Mrs. Tiggs, I managed to get deep enough into my Spanish homework to lose track of time.
 When I finally surfaced from abeja, camisa, and reloj it was just five minutes before I was supposed to close up for the afternoon.
 Rachel pulled her things together and left while I was straightening up the chairs.
 It was petty, but I waited inside the room until the clock showed exactly the time the lab was supposed to finish, and then joined Britney outside in the oppressive heat.

Almost before I knew it we were rolling to a stop in my driveway.
 I fumbled, for the latch, but Rachel put a hand on my arm before I could get the door open.
 She handed me a white-wrapped package with a shy smile.
 "Hang in there.
 Oh, and happy birthday.
 Don't open it now, but I hope you like it."
 I whispered thanks as I hugged her goodbye, and then made my halting, limping way into the house.
 I was only in the house for fifteen minutes before I realized being all by myself was a terrible idea.
 At some point I transitioned from just crying to having a full-blown panic attack.
 It should've terrified me that something new was bringing on an episode, but it was like there was so much else going wrong I couldn't spare any more emotional energy.

“Frey.” Junnie was talking slowly.
 “Stay calm and lie still.” I tried to convey my incredulity as I lay there, unable to move.
 “Explain to me what happened.” All the anger and excitement turned numb.
 What came out sounded no more than a statement of fact.
 “Chevelle held me back and made me watch my mother die.” Junnie didn’t have the outraged look I expected.
 I sifted through the dream—the memory—searching for a way to explain so she would be stunned and infuriated.
 They stared at me, and I was suddenly sure they were the reason I was lying on the ground incapacitated.
 They had control over me.
 My thoughts shifted, running through it again, going backwards from where I was.
 Their faces, the chanting from behind me, Chevelle backing away, the dream.

 Then my beloved brother, you can pretend to fit in, but secretly work for the resistance forces.
 Liz – That just may work.
 Jim – You’re our only hope Johnny boy.
 All our hopes for freedom ride on your capable shoulders!
 To victory!

It gave a screech and fell to the floor, dead.
 Emily raised her hands and vines shot from the ground and wrapped around a troll that had tried to crush Seth.
 I aimed an arrow at its chest and the troll fell to the ground next to the others.
 The last beast fell, dead from Jason's knife, and we all took in a deep breath.
 Seth sheathed his sword and I slung my bow back on my back.
 Emily sat on the ground next to Jason, Seth and me as the dwarf stood in front of us.
 “Sadly,” he started, “I cannot be with you all anymore.
 I must leave and go back to her...” “Wait a minute!” Seth exclaimed, jumping up.
 “You're leaving us?
 You little...” “Seth!” I protested and stepped in front of him.

“We need to get closer to the fight,” Qurrah said, slurring his words.
 “I need to see him.”
 “Sure thing,” Harruq agreed.
 “Come on.
 I have an idea.”
 He grabbed Qurrah’s arm and hooked his elbow around it.
 Qurrah was too weak to complain, so together they ran down the streets.
 They passed closed homes containing people praying for safety and victory.
 Looming ahead of them was the southern gate.
 Hundreds of soldiers stacked against it, their shields braced and ready.

It almost didn't seem like he was talking to me.
 There was no emotion in his voice, no gentle teasing; he didn't even meet my eyes.
 I sat down with a slight hope that he'd thaw out a little by the time class ended, only to shake my head in disbelief when the bell finally rang and proved me irrevocably wrong.
 Maybe he'd go back to normal after a few days.
 There really wasn't any way to know though.
 I didn't even know what'd brought on the sudden change.
 Was he really just angry I'd overheard Jasmin threaten Lucy?
 Why did I even care?
 Spanish dragged by at a snail's pace, but somehow before I knew it, I was walking with Britney towards the tutor lab.
 I should have been surprised when we rounded a corner to find Brandon casually leaning against the wall, obviously waiting for us, for me.

Whatever they did that afternoon, Eric wouldn’t say.
 But something went wrong, and it sent him into a funk so deep, he gave up the job and asked did I want to go camping up the coast.
 We borrowed surfboards, drove to San Onofre, and pitched a tent on the cliffs.
 Between our assaults on the surf, I told Eric stories about my exploits in Pacific Beach.
 Though he chuckled about my status as top dog, he said, “I hope you know that’s not what being Superman’s about?” “Aw, give me a little credit, will you?” I snapped, annoyed that he had seen through me.
 I got more than friendly with Gloria Valenciana, who was down from Los Angeles camping with her family.
 Her dad made her turn in early.
 When I joined Eric at our campfire, I asked him why he didn’t seem interested in girls.
 “Half of my friends are girls,” he said.
 “You know what I mean.

God and Zoë are on top.
 Which comes first, I wouldn't admit even if I knew.
 I read more and follow the lead of Flannery O'Connor, a Christian writer of some masterpieces.
 She advises that at least every other book we pick up should engage our spirit, help us to better grasp God.
 If a book proves difficult, like Kierkegaard's Works of Love, all the better.
 My brain needs the exercise.
 Since reading and wrestling with Brother Lawrence, I often I feel like a wanderer whose spirit longs for home, the way I felt upon waking long ago in the Desert Inn from a vision of heaven.
 I tried to drop writing a couple priority levels, but that move didn't work.
 As usual, a few days without writing, gloom started to creep in.
 So I boosted writing back to number four.

“She’s just a friend.
 We’ve gone out a few times.” “Still, I don’t want to disrupt your life.
 You should accept her invitation.” “I don’t want to.
 I’d rather be with you.” She smiled and leaned over to kiss his cheek, but she could no longer concentrate on her book.
 How could it be that a man she’d known only a week wanted to be with her all the time when she’d gone four or five days at a time without seeing the man to whom she was betrothed?
 Could it be that Davis’ job was harder than Rick’s?
 No—it wasn’t just that Rick didn’t spend half the evening at his office.
 He’d even chosen to be with her rather than with a girl he’d known longer than he had her, a girl from his own decade.
 Confusing thoughts and feelings kept her from being able to fall asleep quickly that night.
 She'd had so much fun this week, watching pictures and using the microwave oven and wearing blue jeans, but she missed her parents and her brother and Tom and Davis.

Johnny – Food coloring.
 Liz – You used red food coloring in place of chicken’s blood?
 Johnny – No, I used yellow food coloring.
 We were out of red at the time.
 Jim – Perhaps that is why you’re attempt at using dark magic failed.
 However I doubt that voodoo curses would solve our problems anyhow.
 Liz – Red food coloring would have been a little better, but not much.
 Jim – You could have at least used Tabasco sauce or something, we always have that.
 Johnny – I didn’t think it would matter what I put in if I didn’t have the Dodo blood.
 Liz – Good point.

Doi’van seemed to need to think more than rest, but either way Rodregas made sure he was ok and then went to check on Imeralda.
 He hoped she had not touched the One Tree.
 As he approached where Imeralda had shown them the door he was dismayed to see only black stone.
 “Damn,” he said quietly.
 He went to the middle where the door had been and was relieved when he was able to step through the invisible but open doorway.
 He felt nothing as he stepped through the illusion and quickly looked around the chamber for Imeralda.
 But she was nowhere to be seen.
 He ran to the base of the One Tree finding that it took longer to run from the door to the tree than he had expected.
 It was huge.
 He felt like he was approaching a mountain, not a tree.

All the servants are gossiping and I know nothing.
 I have had it.
 Mother’s room remains sealed, but I was able to obtain some of her things from Father’s study.
 I am only to use them under Rune’s supervision, so I took the books out and returned to my room with them in secret last night.
 I have scoured through them and though I don’t know all the words of the spell exactly, I think I’ve found a way to escape.
 I’ll have to practice on a servant first.
 Practice on a servant.
 That brought back something Ruby had said.
 Chevelle would have to practice the unbinding spell on someone else first.
 Would he use one of our group?

We gazed out over the cliff, at the horizon… endless.
 I felt his hand on my back and closed my eyes, relaxing into the comfortable, familiar feel of it.
 He pushed me with full force.
 I flew off the cliff, falling straight down.
 I stared back at him as he stood, watching me fall, nothing but open sky above and below.
 I couldn’t imagine why he’d throw me from the cliff, couldn’t think of the magic to stop myself, couldn’t see when I would crash into the base, the rocks below.
 My arms flailed as I jerked awake.
 The group stared at me.
 “Frey?” Ruby asked.
 I grappled for breath.

CHAPTER FOUR
 Marie sat beside Rick at the library, watching in amazement as titles of books and magazines appeared on a screen in front of him.
 Whenever he found something that he thought could help them, a machine in front of her would print the title and its number on a piece of paper.
 She'd thought it would take hours and hours to find a handful of books.
 But in only 45 minutes Rick had a long list of books and articles.
 He filled out request forms for the articles and led her into more rows of books than she'd ever seen.
 He pulled out book after book, stacking them in her arms.
 When both had as many as they could carry, they went to check them out.
 "We have 17 books and 21 articles," Rick told her when they were back at his house with their materials spread out on the floor in front of them.
 "I don't even know where to start."

This was reverence.
 Anvil smiled.
 A movement at the tree line caught everyone’s attention, and I turned to find Chevelle’s onetime guest, Asher.
 He stood in the shadows, staff in hand, as if allowing us to see.
 The air was still as he inclined his head toward Chevelle and then turned, a long, dark braid whipping behind him as he disappeared into the brush.
 This seemed to mean something to the group, something like relief.
 I stared after him, but Anvil stepped forward, thumping his balled fist against his chest in a gesture I didn’t understand.
 Grey followed, repeating the action and adding a single nod, and Ruby clasped her hands, bouncing excitedly from heel to toe.
 I felt myself drawing back together, tied by the knots in my stomach and mind.
 A tandem wolf howl sounded in the distance.

That thought would.
 Sobered, he told her, "I'll miss you, Marie."
 "Really?"
 "Very much."

 "Do you see a lot of girls?"
 "You've been living with me for a week.
 What do you think?"
 She smiled.
 "One called this week."

For a second I thought we were back on the plain, but we weren't.
 The sky was blood red and a crescent moon was rising up.
 From the feeling of the air I knew we weren't underground anymore but I didn't know where we were.
 Skeleton trees were scattered to the sides.
 There were long hills ahead, the grass a light gray.
 “This place looks like it’s from a book about hell,” Seth said.
 “Where are we now?” I asked.
 He shook his head.
 “Do we ever know where we are?” I shook my head and he sighed.
 “Exactly, we never do.

When I entered the bird again, something was wrong.
 It wasn’t only the bird, someone was there.
 Someone else.
 The shock of it threw me back to my own mind.
 My eyes shot open and I scanned the scene again.
 I forgot what I was looking for when I recognized a face, hooded in a cloak, fighting against her own.
 Junnie.
 She stared back at me for one brief moment before she turned to fight some invisible foe.
 The stunned moment took the last of the borrowed courage from me, and I drew in, afraid, as my body remained encaged in vine and thorns.
 My legs were wet with blood, arms deadened to the pain and cold.

The threats associated with climate change and biodiversity loss also underline the fact that while humankind may be segregated by political frontiers, our fates are intertwined ecologically.
 Economically also, islands of prosperity cannot co-exist forever in the midst of oceans of poverty.
 Both unsustainable lifestyles and unacceptable poverty must become features of the past, if we are to curb the growing violence in the human heart.
 Ten years after presentation of our report, we remain convinced that universal health, harmony and happiness are still within our reach, if only we imbibe the eternal truth contained in the following message of Lord Krishna delivered on the battlefield of life called Kurukshetra:
 We human beings can become whatever we sincerely aspire to become.
 Looking back, it is astonishing how much the world has changed since the idea of establishing the International Commission on Peace and Food was first conceived in 1987. Who had the foresight to imagine the monumental changes which have so radically altered the political, economic and social complexion of the world community – the end of the nuclear arms race and the opposing military alliances of East and West, the rising tide of democracy that dramatically and irreversibly transformed the USSR and the countries of Eastern Europe, the growing importance of the UN in peace keeping and peace making, the peaceful end of apartheid in South Africa, the first tangible steps toward lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East, the completion of global trade negotiations and the founding of the World Trade Organization, and concerted actions to stem the degradation of the environment?
 The mid-1980s was a time when global military spending reached an all-time high of $1.2 trillion.
 Economic growth had slowed or stalled in much of the developing world, prompting some to term the 1980s the 'lost decade' for development.
 While there was little agreement on what steps were needed to reverse the arms race and provide a stable basis for world peace, a consensus was emerging that something must be done to address the urgent problems of hunger, famine and endemic poverty that continued to plague much of the developing world and constituted a gnawing source of instability that refused to be contained by national boundaries.
 The unconscionable loss of lives due to hunger in an age of plenty generated growing concern over the issues of food and famine.

I'm not marrying a man who makes me ill when he puts his tongue in my mouth.

 She stuffed the ring in his shirt pocket and marched off.
 All three people in the living room stopped talking and looked up when she returned to the living room.
 "Did you end your betrothal?"
 Mr. Tranton asked, standing.
 "Yes.
 I'm sorry, Father.
 I know that Davis--" "Don't be sorry.
 I just want you to be happy, darling."

BG:  	That’s caca, isn’t it?
 I mean, c’mon.
 Have you read “The Waste Land?”  Jesus.
 You know, I love “Day in the Life.”  Shit.
 It doesn’t get much better than that, pop music-wise.
 “I read the news today oh boy” is just about the finest first line I’ve ever heard.
 I’d kill to have written that one line.
 But, does it compare to “April is the cruelest month?” Or “Turning and turning in the widening gyre?”  Or even, “Something there is that does not love a wall?”  No, of course not.
 And John would tell you the same thing.
 I’m not putting down The Beatles, hell, McCartney and Lennon are the greatest songwriting team of all time.

“You defeated Kojas?” June sighed in frustration.
 “Did you pay any attention to anything?
 Mackenzie, David, Mark and I beat Kojas the first time he appeared.
 It wasn’t easy; let me tell you that right now.” “How did you die?” “Mark died of a wound after we beat Kojas.
 He was too weak to live.
 David and I died in an ambush of what was left of Kojas’ army.
 Mackenzie died from a fatal fall, I don’t remember how.” “Oh,” I said and rubbed my neck.
 “I don’t want to be rude, but do you need to tell me anything else?
 I have to try to come up with a few explanations for back home.” A lot of explanations.
 June walked towards me until she was standing right in front.

I have no idea how to use one of these pig stickers, but I am very good with a bow,” said Imeralda.
 She said it clearly expecting him not to have anything.
 Rodregas did, have a bow.
 He had two very nice bows wrapped up in the wagon.
 But, while the short swords he handed them were dangerous, they were common and easy to replace.
 On the other hand, the Black Yew bows were rare and powerful.
 He also thought about the chain mail that he had found in Ravenhurr’s wardrobe.
 While it was way too small to fit him it would fit Imeralda just fine.
 But to give this woman he barely knew such fine armor and weapons was not something to do casually.
 It made a lot of sense sitting there on the foothills of the Arida Mountains, worrying about Gobelyn and Dire Cat attacks, but they were a great gift; no one had ever given him such a gift.

A lot of artists did this, you know, kind of like what Dylan was doing with The Basement Tapes, except that took on a whole life of its own, because it was Bob.
 So, I did some demos, at Ardent with Jim’s help, and others, I just wrote, you know, just committed them to paper and John helped me get them disseminated.
 It worked well then to do that.
 I don’t know if it still does.
 Probably, though I don’t do that anymore.
 I’m writing, obviously, for myself more these days.
 So, money was coming in, we were playing regionally.
 We opened for The Airplane at the Coliseum.
 For Canned Heat in Little Rock.
 We were part of a triple bill with The James Gang and Rare Earth in Nashville.

“He told me, ‘The one will rise, the one rise!
 He will destroy you!’ That’s almost the same thing as last time.” I tapped the fountain.
 She scribbled, Toad dwarf said, “The one will rise, the one will rise!
 He will destroy you!” Is Kojas’ rising?
 “Seth, do you have anything?” Emily clicked her pencil.
 Seth shook his head, but Jason spoke up, “He said, ‘The King will rise.’ Then he left.” Emily added one last bullet; Toad Dwarf said to Jason, “The King will rise.” Her list was: Toad dwarf said to Jazell, “He’s rising, he’s rising”.
 Who’s coming and is he important?
 Toad dwarf told Seth, “You won’t stop him, little warrior.” Does this mean he’s powerful?
 Toad dwarf said to Jason, “He will destroy all half-ling.” What does “half-ling” mean?
 Toad dwarf said to Emily, “Kill all you like but Kojas will rise.

"Not that I'm complaining, mind you, but why the sudden change?"
 Alec gave me a lopsided smile of his own.
 "My death is nearly certain, but there's always a chance I'll somehow survive.
 As unlikely as that is, I don't want to survive and then find I've poisoned you against me.
 I won't stop you."
 I felt things I hadn't realized were knotted up relax inside me.
 When my voice finally came out it was smaller than normal.
 "Thank you."
 Alec shrugged and gave me another smile.
 "You must have driven your parents crazy with that refusal to back down."

I guess panic attacks are harder on your system than most people realize.
 My body had already started spiraling down to an attack again, but before I could get too wobbly, I made it inside the house.
 Mom met me at the bottom of the creaking stairs with a big smile on her tired face.
 "The view from the rooms as the sun starts to set is even better than I thought it would be.
 Coming here was the best idea we've ever had."
 Normally Mom's enthusiasm was fairly catching.
 You expect that kind of energy in a child; when it comes from an adult it's hard not to react in kind.
 It didn't manage to infect me this time, but it did help focus me on the here and now.
 I figured I owed her for that, so I tried to suppress my generally ungracious nature.
 I even let her lead me up the creaky stairs to show me the 'amazing view' for the third time.

Rick covered her mouth with his again, his kiss so hot and thorough and demanding that it elicited more moans from her.
 He ended the embrace with a series of quick, hard kisses and then eased his hold on her, panting.
 Marie started to reach for him again, but then her eyes narrowed.
 Pushing against his chest so hard that he stumbled back, she whirled and stormed off into the fog.
 How dare he!
 How dare he use his kisses to try to keep her from going home!
 It was already hard enough just to look at him in the morning before she walked in the garden.
 He knew that whenever they kissed, she didn't want to stop, that she'd kiss him forever.
 Just last night he'd told her that they couldn't kiss like that unless they got married.
 And this morning he dared to kiss her that way, knowing that it would make her all but forget her walk!

Rodregas would cut the hair short when he had a chance.
 Ravenhurr had looked for the most perfect physical specimen that he could find and Rodregas was now him.
 Over the years Ravenhurr had “collected” many very gifted young men.
 These men had won athletic contests and were known for their incredible physical gifts, good looks and sharp wits.
 Ravenhurr tested them for strength, reflexes and dexterity.
 Those that succeeded were further tested for the sharpness of their senses, their intelligence and ability to learn new languages.
 The winner of these tests was rewarded with having his soul and mind ripped out and made into a piece of meat to be filled with the mind, personality, and the very soul of Ravenhurr himself.
 However, this time, instead of Ravenhurr, his old guard sergeant had ended up as a new powerful Immortalist.
 As the cold of the stone chilled his back Rodregas thought about his promise to the Celestial Gods that if he were able to kill Ravenhurr and live, then his new duty would be to fight the Immortalists.
 When all and everyone else had failed him over the years, only his duty had kept Rodregas alive.

He dressed and ate quickly, and walked out to the sands of the arena.
 The arena smelled fresh.
 Sometime during the night it must have rained and young squires had raked the sands.
 The final competition of the tournament was a true melee.
 Only the top ten finishers qualified.
 There was no taking turns.
 The ten were spread out in a circle.
 In the center of the arena was a shield painted with the seal of the knighthood, a winged sword in the clouds.
 The squire who claimed that shield and made it to the Cathedral’s main hall with it would be knighted on the spot by the Knight Commander of the Order.
 This day would decide Rodregas’ fate.

everybody needs to be held!
 That's not immoral!"
 He leaned toward her.
 "I've held you a number of times.
 Was that wrong?"
 She dropped her gaze.
 "Well, no.
 Not proper, really, but not immoral."
 He reached out to squeeze her hand.
 "Listen to yourself, Marie.

She smiled, joining him on the sofa.
 "I might even use garlic again.
 But I have to admit that I sneaked upstairs to brush my teeth after we ate."
 He tilted her face up so that their lips were almost touching.
 "So did I."
 She felt his breath in her mouth.
 "I can tell."
 He nibbled at her lips.
 "I was very proud of you tonight."
 "Really?"

2.Coordination of macro-economic policies: The efforts of the industrial nations to achieve higher rates of economic growth and job creation are stymied by the need to maintain macro-economic stability at the same time.
 Due to the competition between OECD members to attract financial resources, rising interest rates or falling inflation rates in one country influence the inflow and outflow of financial resources from other members of the community.
 The efforts to curb inflation at the expense of slower economic growth and job creation need not be so rigorous, if OECD members more closely coordinated their policies to support macro-economic expansion.
 A modest, relatively uniform rise in inflation rates within the OECD would not then result in a significant movement of resources or fluctuation in exchange rates.
 3.Shift investment from defence to education and training: Reduce global defence spending by an additional 50 per cent before the end of the decade to below a maximum threshold of $400 billion.
 Invest at least 10 per cent of the global savings from defence cuts in education and training.
 4.Liberalize agricultural and textile exports: Utilize agriculture as an engine of industrialization, international trade and employment generation by reducing the barriers to a major expansion of agricultural production and exports from and between developing countries.
 More than two billion people in developing countries, representing about 35 per cent of the entire world's population, are dependent on agriculture as a primary source of livelihood.
 This compares with 45 million people in industrial countries, which represents less than 1 per cent of the world's population.
 Agriculture is the most heavily protected sector of world trade.

The magic energy throbbed and Rodregas could feel the ritual screaming for the final release of the magic; there was no way to save anyone else.
 Rodregas would probably die in the next few seconds in the magical backlash of the failed spell, but he thought that he had understood the meaning of the final trigger words used in the rehearsal.
 Rodregas’ years of rejecting his early upbringing made him embarrassed to say the words, but he reached down into that deep, nearly empty place where his little bit of power still sparked.
 Rodregas reached deep inside and pulled that spark of power up until he felt the tingle and inner sensation that he always inelegantly called ‘my itch.’ Rodregas filled his words with the power and the intent behind them.
 “My mind,” he said.
 “My soul to be made one through the flame,” he whispered, and then the circle of blood and living organs started to burn and he burned.
 He burned so deeply that no scream crossed his lips.
 He felt every fiber of his being simply burn.
 Rodregas tried to scream, but no sound could pass his lips.

Transitions should be regarded as social transformations which depend on and result in corresponding changes in the political, economic and other spheres.
 Efforts to guide a multi-dimensional social transition through uni-dimensional strategies, particularly those limited to manipulation of macro-economic policy, are unlikely to yield the anticipated results.
 Even those transitions which are apparently confined to economic activities within a stable political context necessarily depend on changes in social attitudes and in social institutions which can be dealt with most effectively by assuming a wider perspective of the process.
 Clear visualization of the before and after states of transition, the existing system, the goals to be sought after, and a detailed picture of the changes that need to occur in behaviour, attitudes and institutions are necessary for deriving the most effective transition strategies.
 With the knowledge the world possesses today, with the example of many successful nations over the last four decades, and with its highly educated and motivated people, surely the nations of Eastern Europe and Central Asia can abridge the time required and the hardship of lessons learned by trial and error to a few years.
 But this cannot be accomplished by sweeping remedies or hastened by over-eagerness or impatience.
 It will require application of a profound understanding of the process of development and transition.
 We believe that a properly conceived effort to draw on the best available knowledge and experience of other countries can generate a transition strategy that avoids the dangers and pitfalls of the initial approach to reform and puts in place the essential foundations for the new system to function effectively and generate benefits for the people before the dawn of the new century.
 In the preceding chapters we have tried to draw attention to the uncommon opportunities that the world presents at the dawn of a new millennium for the abolition of war and the eradication of poverty.
 None will question the desirability of achieving peace, democratic freedoms and prosperity for all.

Now, it is my turn for a question,” he said.
 Rodregas hoped that Imeralda would do whatever she was going to do soon; the conversation was escalating and he did not think they had much time before things got deadly.
 Rodregas asked, “Why did the Immortalist Taiga capture my friend Doi’van and keep him in his Menagerie of Earth, Sky and Fire for two years before selling him to Ravenhurr?
 He is a Hellborn and should have been of no interest to those trying to become Celestial Gods.” Van’dret became very still at this question, for a long moment he neither moved nor spoke.
 Rodregas wondered briefly if he even breathed or if the powerful sorcerer had moved beyond such mortal needs.
 Finally Van’dret said, “I cannot say what was in the minds of others.” Van’dret started to raise his hand and Rodregas spoke quickly trying to keep him engaged, “So, are you saying there are not Immortalists led by Taiga who are breaking ‘The One Law’ set by both the Gods in the Celestial Realm and the Daemon Lordsin the Infernal to keep balance?” Van’dret went pale at Rodregas words and then he stood up very tall.
 For the first time true anger was in his words, “You do not know what you are getting in the middle of.
 You are barely more than a squire and yet you would get in a battle of beings so much greater than you?” The Immortalist went from anger to laughter, but his laughter did not last long.
 His laughter was like all things Immortalist, beautiful but cold.
 When it ended he said simply, “Time for the three of you to die.” What Rodregas did next he knew was meaningless, but he hoped it would give Imeralda a last chance to act.

“Give me until then, alright?
 We could use the money.”
 “I have saved much of what you earned,” Qurrah said.
 “We will be able to eat, not well, but enough to live.”
 “If you say so,” Harruq said.
 “Good luck with your, uh, studies.
 I have a wall to finish building.”
 “Stay safe,” Qurrah said, offering a small wave as his brother trudged north.
 When he was gone, the smaller half-orc slipped back into the shed, removed a false floorboard, and grasped a small pouch containing various herbs, bones, and knives.
 Reaching back in again, he took out an object wrapped in sackcloth and soaked in blood.

Harruq drew his sword.
 It shook in his hand.
 Aurelia watched as if in a dream.
 She felt magic spark on her fingertips.
 Under no circumstances could she watch him.
 She couldn’t.
 Nor could she believe it.
 He was so kind to her, so kind.
 “Why,” she whispered.
 He put a hand inside the window.

Then Harruq was upon him, slashing recklessly.
 Ahrqur batted his sword left and right, then jumped as Harruq swung back in a scissor-cut that should have shredded his waist.
 The elf landed atop one of his couches, balancing with ease.
 “What reason do you have to kill me?” the elf asked.
 “Are you here for money?
 I could pay you twice the pittance you work for.”
 “Just shut up,” Harruq said, hurling Salvation across the room.
 Ahrqur leapt again.
 The sword punched through the couch and embedded in the wall.
 The half- orc gripped Condemnation in both hands, snarling as the elf launched his own offensive series.

We'll get you back."
 She'd covered her face with her hands and was sobbing.
 How had this happened?
 What had actually happened?
 Was she losing her mind?
 Was this some fantastic hoax?
 Everything was so strange.
 How was she ever going to get home?
 Rick put his key in the ignition but then turned to look helplessly at the terrified girl.
 "It'll be all right, Marie."

“Please, you must listen to me.
 Stay away from the half-orcs.
 They aren’t safe.”
 “Nonsense,” she said.
 She guided a hand across his chest, feeling the break.
 Her hand then traveled to his shoulder, and a deep frown grew across her face.
 “Who did this to you?” she asked.
 “The man in black, the one continuing to train the half-orcs.
 I approached him last night and he nearly killed me.”
 “Harruq is no threat to me,” Aurelia insisted.

That thought brought tears to her eyes, and she snuggled closer to him, wishing she could have everyone she cared about in the same decade.
 They spent the afternoon watching TV, reading, and napping.
 "I feel so lazy," Marie said, stretching as she yawned.
 "It's nice to have a day like this every now and then, though."
 "Yeah."
 She looked at his arms with concern.
 "How does your sunburn feel?"
 she asked him.
 "Still a little sore.
 I should have put some lotion on this morning."

I believed they needed to learn good strong work ethics.
 But I never once hit them, and I never abused them, as I had learned “what not to do” as a father.
 I did everything I could think of to give them the best chance to succeed in life.
 I protected them from what I felt were bad influences, including, sadly, my brother, their Uncle Thomas, who had not been reformed in prison.
 He was an addict into horse racing.
 When my boys were in grammar school, our neighbor asked me who the man was who came to our home during the day while we were at work.
 He said that this guy, sometimes with another man, would enter our house through the garage with the keypad code.
 We knew nothing of this!
 The neighbor described the car, and the description matched Thomas’s car.
 I showed him a family photo and he identified Thomas as the guy.

It is the educational system that imparts to future generations the accumulated knowledge, skill and capacity acquired in the past.
 The quality of that education will determine the quality of the human beings who build our future world.
 Until now, too much emphasis has been placed on transfer of information from teacher to student, too little on the development of thinking and critical faculties by the student.
 Too much reliance has been placed on the capacity of the teacher to teach, too little on the inherent natural capacity of human beings for self-motivated learning and self-discovery.
 It may be fair to say that the state of our educational systems throughout the world is an accurate reflection of the state of human development in different societies.
 In this context, the UN Millennium Goals of achieving universal primary education and eliminating gender disparities in primary and secondary education represent the bare minimum commitment that every society must make to enhance the capacities of its youth.
 The great Tamil poet, Subramanya Bharati, rightly emphasized that nutrition and education are the two legs of a human being.
 Pre-school education should receive as much attention as post-graduate education.
 At the other end of the development spectrum, no society has yet developed the knowledge and expertise to impart the best of what it has acquired to a broad cross-section of its citizens.
 Few have been able to ignite the aspiration for continuous learning and the capacity for original creativity that are the most profound characteristics of human consciousness.

Still others may entirely reverse their direction and contribute to job growth later in the decade.
 Not one is an irreversibly negative factor that will continue to exert a downward pressure on job growth for the foreseeable future.
 Job Creation during the Twentieth Century
 A long-term, global perspective is needed to understand fully the employment problem and the prospects for eliminating it.
 Over the past four decades, the world economy has generated more than one billion jobs, more than were created during the previous four centuries.
 If past trends continue, it will create another 1.3 billion during the next 35 years.
 The current anxiety in the West is similar to that which the United States passed through in the 1890s when agricultural mechanization displaced 4.4 million farm workers, generating double digit unemployment and visions of a dismal future.
 Yet, since then, employment in the United States has expanded by nearly 100 million jobs or 400 per cent.
 Between 1990 and 2005, it is projected to increase by another 25 million.
 The same process of structural transition is repeating itself today and raising the same anxieties.

The album smokes.
 It tears down ceiling tiles.
 It disrupts fish in their blue aquarium lives.
 It calls like a squonk in the wee hours, in the time between sleep and dawn.
 It disrupts phone lines, calls old girlfriends and makes them want you again.
 It stirs mud and makes bouillabaisse.

She had no idea what time it was.
 She went to brush her teeth and take a shower.
 She decided the shower could wait until after breakfast, though, when her stomach began rumbling.
 She hoped Rick was making pancakes too.
 He was in the hall when she opened the door.
 “Morning.” She smiled up at him sleepily.
 “Good morning.” She was wearing only his pajama top and looked unbelievably sexy.
 Drawing her close, he bent his head and kissed her.
 Marie sighed with pleasure as she returned Rick’s kiss.
 She’d never dreamed anything could make her feel this way.

Dieredon watched the brothers travel back to Woodhaven.
 He had been waiting outside the town, and in the starlight the swathe of darkness rolling across the land had caught his eye.
 He had followed and from a distance observed the short meeting.
 His eyes flipped between the half-orcs and their master.
 His heart was torn.
 He had already warned Harruq that he would tolerate no strange behavior, yet he had given a similar warning to the man with the ever-changing face.
 “I do this for you, Aurelia,” he said, his decision made.
 He removed his bow and ran across the grass.
 Velixar had not moved since the brothers’ departure, his hands resting on the grass, palms upward.
 His hood fell far past his eyes, blocking nearly all of his face.

 She laughed.
 "What happens if these things break?"
 "I call someone to fix them."

I did my best to comfort Britney after that, but was more than a little relieved when lunch finally ended.
 That of course made me feel heartless and guilty in turn, but I was still too fragile to deal with her issues.
 When it's all you can do to get through the day yourself, it's impossible to be a pillar of strength for someone else.
 History was a complete waste of time.
 I hadn't even made it through the reading assignment, and I still got a perfect score on the pop quiz.
 Physics was surprisingly full.
 Apparently Alec was the only hard-core party animal in the class.
 I was still feeling weird from Britney's story, so unlike the rest of my classmates, who seemed genuinely intrigued by the assignment, I just pretended to leaf through a reference book all hour.
 Spanish was as bad as history.
 Mrs. Tiggs turned on one of the Spanish TV channels within thirty seconds of class starting.

The elf winced, nearly knocked to her knees by the force.
 “What madness gives you such a desire?” she asked, sending forth the strongest spells she knew.
 Several lances of ice flew down the street, followed by a ball of magma.
 The ball rolled behind the lances, covering the ground in flame.
 Velixar laughed.
 A wave of his hand created a similar shield as Aurelia’s, but instead of keeping it close to his body, he shoved it forward.
 The lances shattered into shards when slammed against it.
 The ball of magma halted when touching the barrier and then reversed direction.
 The elf glared, detonating the attack with a thought.
 Molten rock covered the street, splattering across both Velixar’s and Aurelia’s shields before sliding to the dirt.

 All I know is that his reaction isn’t going to be pleasant.
 Liz – If you like I could help you with it.
 Jim – Thanks for the offer, but there isn’t any reason to endanger you as well.
 Liz – The alternative is to go home and talk to mother, planning my future, she calls it.
 I think at the moment that I would rather have to tell Johnny that Gene is in fact his long lost brother and he’s finally coming home.

The veto power of the five permanent members of the Security Council should be abolished and the diplomatic status of the UN Secretary General should be elevated to that of a head of state.
 4.A detailed plan should be drawn up by the UN for a further 50 per cent reduction, to a maximum of $400 billion, in global defence spending before the end of the decade.
 Spending quotas for member states should be established according to the principle of non-offensive defence.
 5.The peace-making, peace-keeping and peace-enforcing capabilities of the UN should be strengthened substantially.
 A permanent, well equipped UN force made up from 20–30 member states should be placed at the disposal of the Secretary General for rapid deployment in conflict zones under Article 43 of the UN Charter to enforce the decisions of the Security Council.
 Either the Military Staff Committee of the UN could be revitalized to give strategic direction to any enforcement action, or a new structure should be created of member states supplying troops to any UN operation, chaired by the Secretary General.
 Member States should earmark national troops for use in UN Chapter VII enforcement action, the scope of which should be expanded to include humanitarian intervention under circumstances when national governments are either unable or unwilling to protect their populations from imminent threats to their survival.
 6.A cooperative collective security frame work must be evolved that is inclusive of all nations and guarantees their security against acts of external aggression.
 A standing international military force or World Army should be established under a democratic framework to provide unconditional security guarantees to member countries against aggression by other nations.
 If such a force cannot be established at the present time under the UN, then there is need for a separate organization similar in constitution to NATO but open to all nations that practise democratic principles of national governance, contribute financial and defence resources to a common armed force, accept ceilings on national defence expenditure and eschew the possession of nuclear weapons.

Several seconds passed before I realized I'd been unconsciously returning his smile.
 I felt a blush slowly rising past my throat, but I couldn't look away.
 Luckily the bell broke my strange fit of paralysis, and I was able to regain some of my composure while Mrs. Alexander struggled her way through the role.
 "I've been thinking about the fact that I didn't really give you young people a chance to ask any questions that might have come up during the course of your work on our section regarding light.
 Now's your chance, please ask away.
 If I don't know the answer, I'm sure that together we can find an adequate explanation for whatever you might have come across."
 The class was quiet for several seconds, before a hand finally shot up.
 I could have predicted who it would be.
 Every class has at least one teacher's pet.
 Some of the kids end up that way because they have this bizarre thirst for knowledge, some go that route because they like to make everyone else look stupid.

Harruq shifted the body to a more comfortable position.
 “Lead the way.”
 The two slipped out the front door and into the night.
 Upon arriving home, Harruq tossed the body into the far room, stripped off his gorgeous black armor, and plopped down onto the bed.
 “Night, Qurrah,” he said.
 “Sorry, but that elfie wore me out, and I never thought cleaning a place could be so tiring.
 I need to rest.”
 “Good night, then,” Qurrah replied, crawling onto his side of the uncomfortable bed.
 He curled his rags about him and drifted off to sleep, pleasant memories of the battle looping in his mind.

Agriculture will remain the largest single occupation for the foreseeable future.
 For too long this sector has been regarded by planners primarily as the source of essential food production.
 Historically, agriculture has also played a major role as an engine for economic growth and employment.
 The Industrial Revolution in nineteenth-century England was spawned by rising productivity and incomes in agriculture that increased demand for manufactured goods.
 In post-war Japan, South Korea, and more recently Thailand, rising agricultural productivity and a shift to commercial crops have been dynamic engines for economic growth, job creation, higher incomes and rural purchasing power, wider markets for produce, and the growth of downstream industries.
 In Taiwan, this was the result of a conscious strategy to utilize agriculture to stimulate job creation and domestic demand.
 The vast technological gap between the levels of agricultural productivity achieved by most developing countries and the highest yields achieved globally represents an enormous untapped potential for stimulating economic growth and job creation.
 The reduction in agricultural subsidies to farmers in industrial nations called for in the recently signed GATT trade agreements will generate far higher international demand for agricultural exports from developing countries.
 In the next chapter, we argue strongly for an agriculture-led job creation strategy and cite evidence to show how it can generate sufficient jobs to eradicate poverty in many countries.

I tied it on and drew the hood up.
 “Want me to carry anything?” She eyed me as if I was entirely absurd.
 “Well, if you would like to, I can find something for you.” I glared at her back and she turned to grab my arm beneath the cloak, yanking me behind her as we left the house through her closet.
 She replaced the cover that hid the entrance and snatched a quiver of arrows from the ground before pulling me forward again.
 “What are those for?” I asked, indicating the arrows, afraid they would somehow be used in my training.
 “They are arrows, Frey.” She was really on a roll today, a delightful mood.
 I shook my head, certain that didn’t bode well for me, and she laughed.
 “We are leaving them for Rhys and Rider to find.” “Are they poisoned?” “Yes.” I considered that.
 “Did they use all the ones you prepared last night?” “You’re silly, Freya.
 It’s fun.” The way she pronounced my name, like it was dear to her, made it harder to be angry with her.

“Tomorrow,” Aurelia said.
 “Early morning.”
 Harruq nodded, his whole body fidgeting.
 Now that he’d found her he wanted nothing more than to escape.
 He was supposed to thank her and go, not be mocked and ordered around.
 “Go on home,” Aurelia said.
 “I’ll be waiting for you.”
 He did as commanded, and that fact disturbed him greatly.
 Qurrah was awake when he returned.
 “Where have you been?” he asked.

They had one other chart hit.
 What was it called?
 Uh.
 “Fainting Spell, A Bagatelle.”  That was it.
 By The Holly and IV.
 I can’t tell you who that really is.
 CM:  	Ok, um, the next song on Rain and Other Distractions, the penultimate song, before the finisher, “Goodbye to the Shell,” is this odd little folk song, “Right on Poplar Avenue.”
 BG: 	Yeah, that’s Lor’s song, actually.
 Well, I mean, she didn’t write it, except in the sense that she’s inside my head like no one else.
 That song stems from a conversation we were having about the past, about the future.

His eyes went back and forth from his own name and Qurrah’s.
 “You spelled my name wrong,” Harruq said.
 “What?
 How?”
 The half-orc reached over, erased the k in his name and drew a clumsy, capitalized Q at the end.
 He leaned back and smiled.
 The name in the dirt now read ‘HarruQ’.
 “Why did you change it?” she asked.
 “It’s a rather odd spelling.”
 “Look at my brother’s name,” he said.

“Maybe you shouldn't worry, maybe they're wrong.
 You can control what happens.
 If you say it won't happen, it won't.” “I hope you're right,” he said.
 “Me too.” The mood was perfect.
 I saw Seth relax a little and the look on his face was more like himself.
 I was perfectly happy with the way everything was right now until I saw the small outline of a toad dwarf nearby.
 “Uh Seth I don't think this is the best time to mention this but I think we have company.” I pointed to the shape.
 He swore under his breath, and we both entered the dwarf's world together.
 Sure enough, it was a dwarf but there was something strangely different about this particular dwarf.
 He just walked toward us as if he wasn't afraid that I might put an arrow through his head.

He hated leaving her when she was so upset, but after a week’s vacation, he had a ton of work at the office.
 “Call me if you need anything, sweetheart,” he told her, kissing the top of her head just before he left.
 Marie watched him leave and then, with a sigh, rose and went to the living room, still wearing her 1927 clothes.
 She’d tried so hard to get back this morning.
 She’d worn only her 1927 clothes, and her mind hadn’t wandered to 2011 at all.
 What more could she do?
 Well, one thing she wasn’t going to do was give up, she determined as she played with the hem of her dress.
 She’d strolled through her garden countless times without walking into 2011, so who knew how many times she’d have to walk in the garden to get back to 1927?
 She wasn’t going to give up.
 Rick, still concerned about Marie, left work at 4:30, making a quick stop to pick up a surprise for her.

“Felewen, please!”
 Felewen glanced back to her, and that small pause saved her life.
 The man in black had made no threatening move as the other two charged.
 They were almost upon him when he cast aside his hood to reveal his ever-changing face, his deep red eyes, and his horrible smile.
 His hands lunged forward, the floodgates opened, and all his power came rushing forth.
 A wall of black magic rolled like a tidal wave conjured from his fingertips.
 The elven brothers tumbled through and vanished.
 Felewen leapt back when she saw the attack coming.
 She rolled behind a house and tucked her head.
 The wave continued down the street, straight for Aurelia.

She wanted very much to kiss Rick.
 But she was betrothed to Davis.
 She shouldn't be kissing other men.
 But it was getting harder to remember that.
 Rick filled both her days and her thoughts.
 Marie wanted to go to the shore again the next weekend, but Rick's memories of his burn the previous weekend hadn't faded as fast as the burn.
 "Suppose I teach you to drive instead?"
 he suggested as they drove home Friday night after dinner and a movie.
 "Drive?
 Your automobile?"

“Good.
 Can we spar now?”
 “Of course,” Aurelia said, picking up her staff.

 Hours later, they finished and said their goodbyes.
 “See you tomorrow,” Harruq called, sheathing his blades.
 The elf did not reply as she vanished behind the trees.
 He stared after her for a bit, then turned toward home.
 Before he could take two steps, a sudden weight crashed into his side.

We took it easy though..." I'd gotten used to the idea that he left a substantial number of thoughts unsaid out of a desire to protect me from knowing too much.
 I didn't like it, but I'd learned to accept it.
 He didn't need to finish that particular sentence though.
 They'd gone easy because today was Ashure Day, and once the dance finished up, he'd be facing off against Brandon, and it would be stupid to tire himself out when he was going to be fighting for his life.
 It was a thought pretty much guaranteed to stifle a conversation, but I managed a smile.
 "Only you would come back dripping in sweat and say you took it easy."
 Alec's smile was a bit strained at the edges, but the tenderness on his face was genuine.
 "I don't know what I'd have done without you these last few weeks."
 My heart went pitter-patter, but still mindful of the fact that throwing myself at him would just result in him freaking out and keeping me at arm's length, I managed not to go all gooey on the outside too.
 Unfortunately the effort meant I was slow responding.

Walking down the lane, I tried to decide whether or not I wanted Brandon to show up today.
 After my mixed signals yesterday I figured there was a better than even chance he'd 'forget' to come get me.
 Strangely enough that didn't bother me as much as I thought it would.
 It was like walking down the lane managed to put things back in perspective for me.
 How could I be put out about something I hadn't ever actually believed was possible?
 I almost refused to believe my eyes when I came around the bend in our lane and saw a black Mustang parked on the side of the road.
 Brandon stood up from where he'd been leaning against the sports car and flashed me a blinding smile.
 He moved towards me with a casual grace that made little shivers run through me despite my earlier decision not to let his interest, or lack thereof, affect me.
 "I had a bet with myself that you weren't going to wait.
 Somehow the fact I just lost doesn't matter now."

A strange whine emanated from one of the dogs as they shifted to sit on their haunches.
 By their size, I might have guessed they were wolves, but I’d never known a wolf to be tamed.
 Their fur matched the robes of their masters, down to the black trim.
 I couldn’t be certain in the light, but I thought there was even some silver showing.
 Surely they would be less frightening in the light of day.
 Ruby broke the tense atmosphere with a curtsey.
 “And Ruby Summit.” I attempted a smile for her, not missing the silent exchange between Steed and Chevelle.
 They were trying to decide what to do with me.
 “Since you’re apparently not ready to retire for the evening, I suppose we will resume your training,” Chevelle said.
 I sighed.

No, blood.
 My nose was bleeding.
 It took a moment to get my bearings.
 My bed sheets were a tangle and my clothes were disheveled.
 It must have been a dream.
 I had fallen asleep looking at my mother’s pendant, trying to remember her, and somehow combined it with the disaster I had read of the northern clans.
 It was only a dream.
 Shaken, I sat up, struggling to collect myself.
 I reached up to remove the pendant from the hook and squeezed it tight in my fist.
 It felt good, like a connection, and I slid the leather chain over my head, pulling the pendant down to rest on my chest.

He shook his head.
 “No, they’re just gone.” “We’re separated?” she said nervously.
 “Yes,” he replied.
 “What do we do?” “Why are you asking me?” she demanded.
 “You’re the one who comes up with plans.” Emily paced back and forth, trying to think.
 Where were Seth and Jazell?
 Were they okay?
 More importantly, where were they?
 “I don’t know,” she said finally.
 “I just don’t know.” “Oh no,” Jason said nervously.

 He’s never been all that close To anyone in the family.

 What I mean is that his grades have fallen from bad to worse.
 I got a call from the school the other day, they informed me that he has been playing hooky often as of late.
 He even seems to be angrier than usual.
 Jim – I’ve noticed that he’s been in a worse mood than normal, but what do you want me to do about it?
 He doesn’t like me any more than he likes the rest of the world.
 I can’t think of anything I can really do for him.

 Chapter 1 Stepping back out into the relentless desert sun, I once again wished we were still back in Minnesota, or at least that we were done moving.
 Then again I might as well have been wishing that Mom had decided on somewhere other than Utah, or that we'd had some long-lost relative die and leave us a small fortune, or even better that Dad and Cindi...
 The thought was much too dangerous to complete.

“I am, how should I put it… venomous.” I gasped.
 It was her expected response.
 “Yes, yes.
 I know.” She held her tongue out for me to examine.
 As she pressed another arrow against it, tiny slits opened up and released a translucent liquid.
 “Not really venom, per se, all fairies have it.
 A chemical to help break down their food.
 Just that mine is toxic to many.
 Not to worry though, I have pretty good control of it now.
 Nasty, poisonous stuff.” She laughed again, “You know, that’s what Chevelle thought I intended the first time I dusted you.” I recalled the panic in his voice before he whisked her away.

Agreements should be negotiated between major arms suppliers to severely restrict production and sales.
 Strong sanctions must be instituted to discourage states from actively or passively abetting small arms proliferation, especially to non-state actors.
 10.UN action to curb the international trade in major armaments needs to go further than the existing Arms Register.
 Arms exports to areas identified by the UN as trouble spots should be banned by international law.
 An independent agency should be established to verify the submissions from arms-exporting states.
 Major arms exporters should agree to consult the Security Council in advance about large orders received for destabilizing weapons and, where appropriate, coordinate actions to limit the size of arms transfers.
 11.Narcotic drug production and trafficking must be treated as threats to international peace and security.
 The strongest possible sanctions should be instituted under the UN against countries that permit or support these activities.
 UN forces must be made available to assist member countries with eradication of these activities within their borders.
 Economic measures must be supported internationally to provide attractive commercial alternatives to drug growers through special trade agreements for agricultural commodities.

“What are you guys hiding?” Jason’s face twisted up and a snort of laughter fought its way out of his nose.
 “Nothing.” “Right…” Emily gave me a look that said, is this good or bad?
 I didn’t really have an answer for her but I knew that whatever was coming, it wasn’t going to be good.
 “So Jason, we have a question for you.” I nodded towards Emily.
 Jason’s face grinned in a seriously weird way that screamed, ‘weirdo!’ He shifted his hands and said, “What?” Emily stepped forward, “We want to know what you’re…” but she never finished.
 She had triggered it all.
 Jason had been hiding two blue, full, water pistols behind his back and was now shooting them at Emily’s face.
 She was holding up her hands and letting out some sort of squeal.
 Seth had been hiding a full two-handed water gun behind his back and the end was pointed at no other than me.
 “You wouldn’t,” I said, my voice dark.

The coaches believed Eric had quit out of wounded pride.
 The truth was, disappointing people wracked him with shame.
 We wanted to rejoin the teams that year.
 But until our sport came into season and we officially made the teams, we got denied privileges afforded to athletes, like assigned gym lockers.
 Since Eric still wanted to work out and wouldn’t face the world without a shower afterward, Cliff invited him to share his locker.
 Besides running the mile during track season, Cliff was second man on the cross-country team, behind Gary Hafner.
 Eric used the locker for a couple weeks before Coach Gory summoned Cliff to his office, sat him down, and asked him to explain why a new sweat suit just issued to Gary Hafner had turned up missing and gotten found in Cliff’s locker.
 Cliff maintained that he’d never even seen the sweat suit.
 “It looks like Eric stole them,” Coach said.
 “Eric doesn’t steal,” Cliff said adamantly.

But--" "No.
 If I can't have Rick, I don't want anyone."
 She cried against her mother's shoulder until her tears were exhausted.
 Was Rick as miserable as she was, she wondered.
 Was he sorry he'd made it possible for her to go home?
 Was he wishing they'd made love?
 Did he sit for hours just as she did, paralyzed with misery and loneliness, constantly thinking about her as she was constantly thinking about him?
 "Why don't I get you some juice, darling?"
 "No, thank you."
 "I don't want you to get sick.

The problem was not just the individual Immortalist; many an angry town would have killed the local Immortalist Sorcerer after having their people taken.
 Anyone that struck back at an individual Immortalist would face the wrath of the Guild of the Celestial Path, which included not just the god-like power of the Guild Master and his various sorcerers, but also the army of the Guild known as The Immortal Guards.
 While not a large army, they were the most feared warriors in the world.
 The leader of The Immortal Guards was called the Commander General, and Rodregas knew of his deeds and background though he had never met him.
 General Rigoria had once been the Grand Marshal of the same Knightly Order that had trained Rodregas.
 The Order was unique in that it trained not just in the various martial arts but also in the magical, and recruited those who had magical power, but lacked the temperament or intelligence to be a sorcerer.
 Instead of working toward the power of sorcery, they underwent the Sigil ceremony, gaining a magical enhancement but losing the versatility of a true mage.
 Gaining such sigils was outlawed by the guide except for their own warriors, but the Order of the Soaring Heavens was also the traditional sources for the Gods own Paladins, and even the Celestial Guild had never dared to anger the gods by interfering with their use of sigils.
 Rigoria had been one of the greatest of the Order of the Soaring Heavens, but he had grown old and his health had failed him.
 When tempted by the Immortalists with a new body, he had accepted.

The blades in his bow snapped inward.
 “Arrows cannot hurt me,” Velixar mocked.
 “They did not the first time.
 Why do you hope so now?”
 “Because these arrows are different.”
 He fired three at once, all burying deep into Velixar’s chest.
 The man in black screamed as the sacred water burned his skin.
 He fell to one knee and vomited a pile of white flesh and maggots.
 “You will suffer,” he gasped.
 “For ages, I will make you suffer.”

she whispered into his ear.
 "I like it anywhere you kiss me."
 She pressed kisses along his neck and then across his jaw, finally reaching his mouth.
 Their kiss was slow and sweet, and Marie sighed into his mouth.
 "It's so nice," she murmured.
 "What?"
 He tangled his fingers in her hair as he bent to kiss her neck.
 "Being able to kiss the man I love whenever I want instead of having to wait for him to kiss me."
 "You can kiss me any time, anywhere you want."
 He nibbled on her neck.

Antonil pulled his head back, the point stopping just shy of drawing blood.
 An upward cut took the blade from the elf’s hand.
 Antonil’s sword looped around, thrust forward, and buried deep inside flesh.
 The elf fell, gasping for air from the fatal wound.
 Blood pooled below him.
 Antonil pulled his sword free and saluted him with the blade.
 “Well fought,” he said.
 An arrow clanged against his sword and ricocheted off.
 “A warning for your honor,” said a camouflaged elf as he stepped out from behind a door.
 A second arrow followed the first, thudding against Antonil’s shield.

 Two more arrows flew, but they halted in mid-air.
 Velixar stood, his hand outstretched, gripping the projectiles with his mind.
 The elf fired two more volleys but all the arrows froze beside the others.
 “Fool,” Velixar hissed.

For a second I worried I'd made him angry.
 "No, not like werewolves."
 I waited for him to elaborate.
 When the silence grew too uncomfortable I was the first to crack, just like always.
 "Did I say something wrong?"
 Alec's voice was surprisingly gentle.
 "No, you've nothing to feel sorry about.
 I should tell you though that calling a shape shifter a werewolf is the kind of insult that nearly always results in a fight, and often even a death."
 I felt momentarily like I'd been hit.
 Alec was waiting for me to respond, but I couldn't bring myself to say anything.

He just remained sitting there.
 “What should I do?” A sly grin crossed his face and he rolled his hand out in front of him.
 “You are only limited by your imagination, Freya.” Great, so if I screwed up it was just a problem with my mind.
 I considered that, recalling what Steed had said about feeling it, thinking about what you wanted to happen.
 But what did I want to happen?
 I had to catch that line of thought before it spiraled out of control; I concentrated on finding something small.
 A tiny pebble lay on the ground at my feet.
 I focused on it hard, willing it to rise.
 When nothing happened I looked for Chevelle’s reaction.
 He watched me, his serene mask back in place.

What did you get?
 Jim – I didn’t sleep through the entire class, I was awake for all of the tests.
 Liz – But what did you get?
 Jim – I got a solid D.
 Liz – That’s barely passing.
 Jim – But it is a passing grade.
 Liz – Why did you even bother to take the class if you weren’t going to attempt to try and do well in it?
 Jim – Well, I needed four more credits to be considered full time, and Mayan art fit into my schedule pretty well, so I took it.
 Liz – Did you learn anything at least?
 Jim – Yeah, I don’t really like Mayan art.

If he could actually eat that much candy that fast shouldn’t he be like 400 pounds by now?
 Liz – Maybe he switched to some expensive imported brand of German chocolate.
 Jim – Does that make him a junkie?
 Liz – Not yet I hope.
 Jim – So what are you painting.
 Liz – I told you, “Dorks Playing Poker”.
 Jim – I thought you were just messing with Gene and Johnny.
 Liz – No, you’re playing games, but I’m calling it “Dorks Playing Poker”.
 I like the sound of it.
 Jim – It does have a nice ring to it.

“What do you do with the drugs if you don’t take them?” “I’ve probably got one hundred Oxycodone pills in my safe at home with as many refills as I want, but I won’t be using them,” I said.
 “I’ll take them if you don’t want them.” Fish on!
 “I’ll bet you would, I had a friend who sold his for a lot of money to a coworker,” I said.
 I still had my pants on when she offered to buy the Oxy.
 I noticed that she had left the door to the bedroom wide open and I wondered if someone was listening.
 I told her I was a “professional” and a “family man” and it just wasn’t worth the risk.
 She said she understood but if I changed my mind, she and her boyfriend would pay $25 per pill.
 I said thanks, but no thanks.
 She asked me to finish undressing and get on the bed for the massage.
 She stood directly in front of me, just a few steps away as I took off the last of my clothes and I stood there naked.

She dropped her own gaze.
 "The reason I like dancing so much is that I like you to hold me."
 He smiled at the pretty rosiness in her cheeks.
 Taking her hand, he leaned close to whisper, "One day--one day soon--I plan to arrange things so that I can hold you all night long."
 Her blush deepened.
 She understood his allusion, and although she wasn't ignorant of what the marriage bed involved, she had no firsthand experience at all.
 And Davis wasn't some adolescent boy trying to touch what he shouldn't; he was her Prince Charming, and he'd all but proposed marriage to her.
 Daringly she entwined her fingers with his and raised her eyes to smile into his.
 The evening was magic.
 Marie and Davis had dinner alone at the Locke-Ober Café, Boston's most exclusive restaurant, and then he took her dancing at a private club where she'd never been.

Still, he had no choice but to try.
 He tucked his bow beneath him and then smashed his face into the dirt while sprinkling grass atop his head.
 He shifted his legs back and forth until as much grass sprang up around them as possible.
 He covered the rest of his body in his cloak.
 A few words of magic shifted its colors, better emulating the nearby terrain.
 He tucked his arms underneath him, closed his eyes, and waited for his fate.
 For the longest of time, silence.
 His shoulder pounded with each heartbeat; his chest screamed with each breath.
 Colors swam across his eyes.
 His ears, incredibly sensitive even compared to other elves, strained for the sound of approaching dead.

Art – Listen and learn.
 First of all, I don’t understand women, nobody does, some of the time I feel that they don’t even understand themselves.
 Jim – If you don’t understand them, what makes you an expert?
 Art – Do you think all TV weathermen understand how weather is actually formed?
 Jim – Considering that ditzy blonde girl who does the weather for channel five, no I don’t think they understand the weather what-so-ever.
 If she’s a good sample of that profession, I would be surprised if most of them could even read.
 Art – They probably don’t understand everything that goes on in the atmosphere, and why it all happens, but they do have the years upon years of observation down so they can predict what might happen.
 That’s what I do.
 Don’t know how they work, but I am familiar with some of the more important signals women give off.
 And what happens after those signals appear.

“I,” she started and then paused as if caught up in her own words, “I think that is the ‘One Tree.’” At the responding look of confusion she said, “The legendary source of all Nymphs.
 While we serve the Gods like all mortals, the One Tree is our source.
 It is to us like water is for a fish.
 I don’t know how to even explain it to one who is not of our people.
 But I did not think it was real.
 It is a concept of what we are as a people.
 How can it be here off of a chamber for warriors earning the greater sigils?” Imeralda started forward.
 Rodregas caught her arm, holding her back.
 He was not sure what to say but Doi’van was.
 “Before you examine it more, can you come look at what we found?

 I didn’t play with my fullest potential before.
 Johnny – Uh-huh
 Eugene – Just remember when its all over that it’s just a game, don’t get suicidal or anything.
 I mean I was kind of hungry, but now that we’ve eaten I don’t have anything to distract me from handing out the beat-down.
 Johnny – Will do.
 Eugene – Its going to be bad for you, maybe we shouldn’t play it’ll save you a lot pain.
 Johnny – I think I can handle it.
 Eugene – Are you sure?
 It’s going to really hurt!

AElves, who are not physically as strong as other people, loved the metal.
 Rodregas held it up to himself and then, as excited as he had become, his heart sank as he realized that the suit was both too short and much too slim for him to wear.
 While there were straps to adjust it, his new body was very large and he would never wear the beautiful armor.
 He threw the armor on the bed.
 It might not work for him to wear, but he could get a good amount of money selling such fancy armor.
 It was the first item of real worth that he had found.
 On a shelf above it was another small pile of the silver chain.
 When he pulled it up he saw that it was a helmet, a solid Mithril skullcap with sides of chain mail designed to be connected at the bottom.
 He reached up and pulled it on his head, but even his head was too large for the AElfin style Mithril armor.
 It quickly joined the suit of armor and the candleholder on the bed.

I had always supposed his prescience was shadowy.
 But maybe not.
 By that Sunday morning when he showed up at Kenny Niedermeyer's, he might have gotten the whole message.
 I think about standing outside the basketball gym a month before his last day, when Eric could easily have run like he insisted Billy and I do.
 But he said “I’m going to stay and take my punishment.” “For what?” I asked, and he didn’t answer.
 For what?
 I still want to know.
 A favorite mystery writer of mine, Ross McDonald, earned this praise from a reviewer: “McDonald doesn’t write about crime.
 He writes about sin.” I think back to the day I spent asking kids whether they often felt guilty about something but had no idea what it was.
 Though I didn’t understand at the time, I was asking if they felt the darkness in their nature, the affinity for sin.

Celestia has grown distant to her clerics.
 Mankind breeds like mice while the elves find themselves gradually dwindling.
 A man fighting an elf is like a grain of sand blowing against a stone, yet strong winds and fields of sand can reduce the sturdiest of boulders to dust.”
 “What are we to do?” Qurrah asked.
 Velixar looked at him and smiled.
 “Kill the messenger and the guards that accompany him.
 Vaelor will be furious at the death of family, however distant.
 He will have every excuse to war with the elves and we will exploit that war to our purposes.”
 “Will you accompany us?” Qurrah asked.
 Velixar shook his head.

LIVING MONUMENTS Far rather would I pass away And leave a noble son of mine Whom I had taught to love the fine, The just and honest, in his day To serve the world with courage bold, Than have my life on granite told.
 I’d rather feel when death is near That in my children I shall live.
 No monument of stone can give Me greater glory, year by year, Than sons and daughters going on In truth and honor, when I’m gone.
 Who leaves a noble son on earth, A noble daughter, sweet and pure, Has monuments that long endure.
 No shaft can give her greater worth.
 The luster of her children’s deeds Is all the monument she needs.
 I dream of a heaven where Mary, my beloved grandma, can meet my Zoë.
 She is a blessing of inestimable worth, a beauty with a noble round face and hundreds of expressions, and she’s strong, with the same broad shoulders and barrel chest as her weight-lifting brother.
 Twice lately I have encountered the same Bible verse, from the prophet Joel.
 "I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophecy, your old men shall dream dreams."

Rodregas easily dodged as he landed a strong blow to his opponent’s chest.
 Rodregas was used to sparring with Doi’van and was surprised when his opponent went flying into the line of contestants and did not get back up.
 Rodregas waited a moment and then looked at the knight who stood outside the match.
 The knight did not look as surprised at the quickness of the match as Rodregas.
 He simply nodded toward Rodregas.
 Rodregas left the square and the knight sent the next two in.
 By mid morning Rodregas had cleared out his square without major effort.
 He noticed that all the other squares were still going on.
 His matches had ended faster than the others.
 His body’s balance of strength and speed were at full advantage in hand-to-hand fighting.

Instead, I have tried to show a bit more into their thoughts, their hearts, and their souls.
 I have had people call Harruq and Qurrah evil.
 Perhaps you agree.
 Much of what they have done certainly is evil.
 I will not sit here and justify the deaths of children, and to do so would paint me a psychopath and my characters sick beings.
 I view Velixar as sort of a recruiter, the kind of man who’d be right at home at a Nazi rally filling confused kids with bigotry, anger, and murder.
 He is gone, for now anyway, and in The Cost of Betrayal these two brothers will get a chance to live on their own.
 For once Harruq has not only felt regret but done something about it.
 For once Qurrah has seen that the darkness he follows is not the absolute power it claims to be.
 This Half-Orc Series is a story of redemption.

Splints holding together broken bones were also in clear evidence.
 At least the enchantment against flying insects seemed to be holding, otherwise it would have been even worse.
 Imeralda led the two men over to a corner where a young man lay; he was unconscious and looked near death.
 From his wounds Rodregas guessed he had been injured during the sword and shield competition.
 To Rodregas’ relief no one was paying them any attention, not even to Doi’van.
 Rodregas and Doi’van did their best to block the view of others as Imeralda gathered the limp pale hand that should have belonged to an old man, not a young one, and slipped the small frog figurine into it.
 Quickly she channeled the power.
 Rodregas could feel the instinctive rise of the young man’s own power.
 Then the squire started to squirm weakly in pain.
 Both Doi’van and Rodregas reached out and steadied the young man until it was over.

Her tears spilled over.
 "Then stay here with me.

 He took her hand, sliding the ring onto her third finger.
 She shook her head, gazing at the ring as tears ran down her cheeks.
 "Just over five weeks ago, I had a fight with Davis.
 I was confused and didn't have a chance to talk to my mother about it.
 I needed to and was going to, after I'd walked through the garden and thought about it and it was time for her to be awake .

How did your latest shoot..." Whatever I'd been about to say evaporated off of my tongue as I entered the living room and saw Mom curled up on the couch with bloodshot eyes.
 Mom had always been the strong one.
 I still more or less belonged in some kind of padded room.
 Mom had simply accepted events and done her best to hold our life together so there'd be something for me to come back to.
 "What happened?"
 I wanted to comfort her like I used to do with Cindi, but I suddenly realized I didn't know how.
 Parents weren't supposed to need reassuring.
 If they did, they were supposed to work it out between each other.
 Only now there was just her.

Sonowin spun, diving closer to the darkness and underneath the giant hand.
 Cries of pain filled the night as more and more elves fell to the reaching black magic.
 Dieredon held on tight, trusting his life to Sonowin.
 He scanned the battlefield while they whirled up and down, over one hand and then dancing away from another.
 Just as Sonowin pulled higher and higher into the air, outracing more than seven growing hands reaching up for them, the elf spotted two lone figures amid the sea of dead.
 “Sonowin,” he shouted to his steed.
 “There, you must get to them!”
 The horse snorted, banked around, and dove straight for the approaching hands.
 A quick spiral avoided the first wave.
 Dieredon clutched his bow and held on for dear life, his eyes locking on the man in black who stood perfectly still, his arms at downward angles from his body.

I could still feel the faintest traces of his power long after he'd finally let my hand go with obvious reluctance and strode off, leaving Dominic and I to find our seats.
 ** The pack was more subdued than normal on the way home.
 Everyone splintered off into smaller component parts as soon as we passed the wrought-iron gate signaling the entrance to the Graves estate.
 Donovan was waiting patiently inside the door, but he took one look at the bristling bundle of energy that was Alec, and obviously revised his plans on the spot.
 "Shall I have dinner delayed, Master Alec, Mistress Rachel?"
 "I'll take mine later, Donovan, but please don't let that inconvenience the rest of the household.
 I'll be out in the garden if anyone needs me."
 Alec took a pair of quick steps down the hall, and then turned back and looked at me.
 "Would you care to join me, Adriana?"
 It wasn't until we'd been sitting in a secluded corner of the sprawling, green sanctuary for nearly half an hour that Alec finally relaxed.

 Because you’re as great as anybody.

 I stared at my vicious expression in the mirror, amazed and perplexed.

The movement towards democracy is not merely a question of idealism.
 In some countries, particularly in Africa, it is an essential step towards over coming the desperate economic conditions that threaten the lives of millions of people.
 In many others, it can vastly accelerate the development process by releasing greater social initiative.
 In his message to the ICPF quoted earlier, the UN Secretary General emphasized the importance of democratization – what he chose to call political development – as an essential foundation and complement to peace, and to both economic and social development.
 There have been cases where development was accompanied by an authoritarian political system.
 But, we have invariably seen that if the participation in the market place is not accompanied by political participation, development efforts are brought to naught by social and political instability.... Once again, therefore, we see the inescapable relations governing the goals of peace, development and democratization – these are the goals of the United Nations.
 In order for this revolution to have its full beneficial impact on the world’s political and economic affairs, its principles need to be extended to cover all nations and international institutions.
 The end of the confrontation between democratic and autocratic superpowers within the UN system opens up the possibility of finally translating the idealistic aims of the UN into practical realities.
 First and foremost is the prospect of extending representative government to all nations.
 This effort will be given strong impetus by establishing democracy as a minimum condition for membership and participation of states in the affairs of the UN.

In truth, Eric moved in with me.
 On school days when the ocean beckoned, I might stop by the hospital at visiting hours, wash up and don a smock, spend a few minutes with my mom, and get her to sign absence slips.
 Eric didn’t need absence slips.
 If he returned to school after an absence and told the attendance clerk he’d been out with the one-day variety of bubonic plague, she would have excused him rather than phone his mother to verify.
 When anyone from the school called Sylvia, she might hold the person on the phone for an hour, ranting about their misdeeds.
 I have two pictures of Eric.
 His senior picture, given a full page in our senior-year annual, a head shot of keen blue eyes with thick lashes, freckles, and sandy hair, a chin square as Dick Tracy’s, an easy grin that would have wrongly convinced you he was loaded with confidence.
 And the one Sylvia called the “Jesus body picture” a snapshot somebody took in the locker room.
 Eric in a jock strap, beaming, his legs and arms spread as though to greet a familiar angel.
 Eric was superman.

Maybe whatever he was drawing was absolute crap.
 Maybe the masters like Michelangelo and da Vinci had completed their greatest works with expressions very similar to what everyone else in the class was sporting.
 Still, I couldn't help envy such contentment.
 I dropped off my bundle of papers at Mrs. North's class, and started back towards my locker.
 I couldn't help trying to catch another glimpse of the art class as I walked past.
 I'd been hoping to see Alec again, but hadn't expected him to look up as I craned my neck to see inside.
 I stumbled a little in surprise.
 He was still gorgeous, but the simple joy was gone.
 He no longer looked like something that couldn't exist in this world, but even with anger etched on his features my heart still skipped a beat.
 I ducked around the corner and started down the stairs, my embarrassment at being caught staring giving way to anger.

 She was halfway down the stairs when she remembered she'd promised Rick that she'd wake him up so that he could stay within earshot of her.

For enterprises which do not qualify or cannot compete for limited bank resources, financial institutions offering hire purchase or leasing of industrial and consumer goods are necessary.
 The market reforms were expected to lead to a rapid proliferation of new small enterprises, but most of those created so far are engaged only in trading and retail sales.
 Small business development centres, business incubators, industrial estates, and venture capital funds are needed to encourage entrepreneur ship.
 Some large industrial enterprises have begun leasing portions of their space and equipment to groups of employees who form small businesses for production of equipment and components.
 This practice should be encouraged and popularized as a natural step towards privatization.
 9.Information is a stimulant and fuel for transition: The shortage of reliable in formation and of institutions to disseminate it are major constraints on the development of the market.
 In a command economy, a few people at the top receive most of the information and take most of the decisions, while the rest of the population carries them out.
 In contrast, the market is based on millions of decisions taken every day by millions of individuals in fields, factories and retail stores around the country.
 All these decision makers require timely access to re liable sources of information.
 Information is needed to make sound business decisions, such as the production of or demand for different commodities or variations in price by region or over time.

Again that greedy look.
 “You are extraordinary.
 I do not have to give you unearned power.
 I must simply guide and instruct.” Velixar stood, and when his power flared, Qurrah fell to his knees and worshipped his new master.
 “You are what I have searched for all these years.
 You and I will destroy this world side by side.
 We will lay waste to all life and put absolute order upon every last soul.”
 “Teach me,” Qurrah said, his mouth buried into the dirt.
 “Show me the power I have sought for so very long.”
 Velixar looked down at his thin, ragged apprentice.

We hid our bikes in the trees and snuck up to their backyard.
 Jason and Seth appeared to be setting up some airplane that they built from scratch.
 They were muttering to each other and assembling a table they would use for a launch pad.
 I grabbed my water gun and Emily took out her trebuchet, with her balloons, and we snuck up on them.
 I held my hand up to stop Emily, waiting until Jason and Seth were grabbing the airplane out of a box and lowered my hand.
 “Revenge!” I yelled, and ran out from behind the trees, with Emily following.
 The looks on their faces were priceless.
 They spun around just in time as Emily launched a balloon right at Jason’s face.
 I aimed at Seth, who I soaked in minutes.
 Their faces looked like they had seen a dinosaur come back to life.

I heaved once and Steed shook beneath me with laughter.
 I glanced up to find him looking at Chevelle.
 For some reason it angered me, even though I knew Steed wasn’t laughing at him.
 I was talking again, without regard to thought.
 “His mother died, too.
 We killed her.” It sounded so matter-of-fact, my head bobbing along with the words.
 I couldn’t seem to stop.
 My mouth opened to speak once more but I was suddenly swept up, off Steed’s lap and into Chevelle’s arms.
 I managed fear for half a second but then lost the feeling to dizziness, followed quickly by only dull numbness.
 Chevelle was laying me on my bed.

We are told to do whatever he commands, but also told to stay as far away from him as possible,” said the young boy, who could not have been much more than twelve years old.
 Rodregas nodded and said, “Sounds like good advice.” Rodregas looked up as Doi’van and Imeralda entered the room.
 Doi’van looked grim.
 But as Rodregas assumed no one had died, he had to smile.
 “Is it that bad?” he asked.
 Doi’van missed his amused tone, or he was simply not in the mood to hear it.
 “The news is not all good,” Doi’van agreed.
 Doi’van grabbed the far too small stool beside the bed, which was the only other piece of furniture in the little dorm room that they had been assigned.
 Rodregas knew it was only due to his visitor status and having ‘servants’ that he had his own room, most squires would share housing during the tournament.
 Rodregas watched the stool curiously as Doi’van sat to see if it would actually hold the massive weight of the Hellborn.

Alec let go of my hand with an actual look of regret.
 Mrs. Tiggs seemed to have read whatever memo Mrs. Sorenson had been working off of earlier.
 She started out the hour by asking me a question I was positive wasn't in any of the chapters I'd ever read.
 The class' collective mouth dropped in astonishment as Dominic called her on it.
 "But Mrs. Tiggs, isn't that covered in Chapter 18?
 I mean, I just started the class obviously, but it just seems confusing.
 Your syllabus says we're talking about the preterit today."
 The only other person I'd ever met who could've even come close to pulling off such an innocent expression was Rachel, and I wasn't sure even she could compete with Dominic today.
 If I'd found her standing in front of a broken window with a rock in her hand, and she'd told me she had no idea why the window had shattered, all the while flashing me that look, I would've believed her.
 Mrs. Tiggs apparently wasn't quite so gullible.

Rodregas twisted as he fell and grabbed one of the slavers and brought him down.
 With a quick stab into his groin, Rodregas took the slaver out of commission.
 Rodregas rolled off his squirming body and threw himself up to a standing position.
 He almost immediately went down again as his wounded thigh buckled under him.
 Rodregas saw the Immortal Guard who had stabbed him, a stocky man with large arms.
 He was coming in carefully, shield up, sword in position.
 Rodregas made up his mind not to underestimate him despite being severely wounded.
 Rodregas struggled back up and spread his feet wide for balance and locked his legs straight to try to keep them from buckling under him.
 He felt cold and knew he was losing blood fast.
 Rodregas knew that this was probably it.

“We think that our Night’s Circle wasn’t strong enough because Mark was seriously injured.
 But no problem, you guys have to destroy him now.” She must have seen me shaking because she added, “No pressure.” “No pressure?” I practically squeaked.
 “You just put the fate of both worlds on my shoulders.” “No,” she said, “I put the fate of both worlds on all four of your shoulders.” “Alright, is that all?” I asked, eager to leave.
 June nodded and I turned to open the door.
 I was just about to turn the handle when she said, “Jazell, don’t be scared to bring out your emotions.
 They make you stronger.” I looked over my shoulder to see June standing stiffly.
 “Thanks,” I whispered.
 “Thanks June.” “Good luck, Jazell.” I opened the door and saw that Emily and Jason were also coming out of their rooms.
 Emily looked a little shaken but she gave me a thumbs-up.
 Good luck, June’s voice whispered one more time.

She leaned in close to my ear with her mouth, her young body firmly against my back, and then asked me seductively if I would sell her the Oxy.
 I told her I would find out how many I had and we could probably work something out and sell them to her.
 She then asked me to turn over and she sat on me, barely above my crotch.
 I immediately noticed a tattooed first name of “Steve” on her flat stomach, just right of her belly button.
 I tapped the tattoo and ask her if that was her boyfriend’s name.
 She leaned into me and whispered that it is just some guy who treats her like crap but she keeps going back to him.
 The fact that she chose to whisper that bit of information convinced me he was outside the open door.
 As we talked I described to her that I had a very controlling wife and two young children at home.
 I told her this because I needed to set some restrictive boundaries; I knew I would need to work within the confines of the narcotics officers, and this would allow me to put her off, buy some time, if I needed it.
 She talked with me and continued to massage my chest as she straddled my naked body.

The black wolf was inching towards me now, growling low in its throat.
 I could see its haunches tense up, and then it was airborne, hurtling towards me almost faster than I could follow.
 Only it didn't hit me.
 A patch of night had interposed itself between me and the wolf.
 My vision still wasn't up to making out fine details, and everything was moving too quickly to follow.
 The growling seemed to be in three parts now, which didn't make any sense because the patch of night was vaguely man-shaped, if impossibly big.
 There was a yelp as one of the wolves was tossed into the side of the canyon with enough force that I could feel it from where I was lying.
 A shower of sparks lit up the night as the second wolf dodged away from my defender, and then impossibly the first wolf was back and darting in as I heard jaws snap shut on something.
 The black shadow staggered back, nearly falling under the combined weight of its two opponents.
 A second later another yelp was cut short as one of the wolves fell away to lie motionless on the ground.

His horse neighed a quick question, one Dieredon wished he could laugh at.
 “Everyone can be killed,” he said, tying his hair behind his head.
 “And no, I have no plans of breaking my ribs again.”
 The horse made an interesting little noise, one Dieredon had long ago learned was laughter.
 He smacked her rump, earning himself an angry neigh.
 “Fly on.
 You don’t want to miss the fun, do you?”
 A snort was his answer, but the creature did fly faster toward the rest of its kin.

“Take him,” she said.
 A bolt of lightning hit his shield, numbing his arm and knocking him back.
 The shield slumped low, but he charged anyway, fully willing to die fighting.
 “For Neldar,” he cried, thrusting at Aurelia’s chest.
 Felewen was there first.
 All it took was three cuts.
 The first took the man’s sword from his hand.
 The second took his arm from his body.
 The third took his life.
 A final bolt of lightning shot down the street, killing the wounded soldier who had fled.

The other four fell dead from my arrows and Jason's knives.
 I ran out from behind the tree and stormed over to the squirming faery man.
 Or I should to call them faery jerks now.
 I grabbed his coat and forced him to look at me.
 He smirked and I couldn't hold back the urge to slap him.
 I slapped my hand across his face so hard it left a mark on his cheek.
 “Start talking,” I snarled.
 “Who are you guys and what are you doing?” The faery jerk smirked again.
 “We're part of Kojas' personal guard.
 We were sent to look for you half-lings.” “Well I want you to know something,” I said and got closer to his face.

He had never been unkind to her before they'd become betrothed.
 Of course, both times before when he'd shouted at her, he'd come to her to-- "Marie?"
 Davis called as he tapped on her door.
 "Darling, I'm sorry.
 Please come out for a minute."
 She went to open the door.
 "You hurt my feelings.
 And you hurt my arm."
 "I'm sorry.
 I'm under a lot of pressure at work, and I took it out on you."

“Yeah.”
 Qurrah chuckled, but it was mirthless.
 “I do, and it does not surprise me as much as it should.
 I’m not sure who would mate with our mother, but some elf man did.
 We are smarter than most realize, you know that.
 Our features are sharper, and we only resemble the orcs that attacked Veldaren.
 It is a part of us.
 Unwanted, perhaps, but I shall not cower and hide a part of who I am.”
 “Just strange, is all,” Harruq said.
 “Life is strange.”

Tears trickled down his face.
 He felt the anger growing inside him, but he forced it down.
 In his mind’s eye, he saw Velixar.
 The old prophet warned of death, retribution, and pain, but Harruq silenced him.
 Let the gift be gone.
 He denied the darkness within him.
 If this was betrayal, then so be it.
 He would pay the cost.
 Great spasms racked his body.
 All the power Velixar had granted him fled.

Rick glanced at his watch.
 She'd been in the garden for 20 minutes.
 It was foggier than usual--was that an indication that there'd be a door or window or whatever back to 1927?
 Now that he'd told her he loved her, had opened his heart to her completely, he couldn't bear the thought that she might not walk back into his arms.
 So when he at last saw her moving through the fog, he ran to snatch her up.
 "Marie," he sighed into her hair.
 She could barely breathe but didn't want to be released.
 When he at last set her down, she continued to cling to him.
 "I wish you didn't have to go to work today."
 He was surprised by her words.

Seconds later Jason walked through the trees, rubbing his face.
 Seth grinned at all of us; we were back.
 That’s how it all started.
 I don’t know how we got the gift to become these different people, but we did.
 That’s the mystery and hopefully we’ll solve it one day.
 We were chosen for some unknown reason, but that reason doesn’t matter.
 All that matters is that we protect this town.
 Jason’s eyes flashed.
 I stood up and leaned over to him.
 “What Jason?” “Monsters, a whole bunch of them.

Instead, pillars of soft light reached up to the sky, swaying slowly back and forth with the wind, creaking in a rhythm I'd known by heart since I was seven.
 I felt tears collecting in the corners of my eyes as I reached out and touched the nearest tree.
 It was as if the world I'd known my entire life had been simply a moldy cover designed to hide the true nature of my surroundings.
 Now the mask was gone and I was immersed in vivid colors, living lights, and a sense of harmony so strong it nearly overwhelmed me.
 It was impossible to say for certain how long I sat looking at the gentle motion of the tree branches, marveling at the way things made up of light could still cast shadows when silhouetted by the harsher light of the sun.
 Only somehow the sun had disappeared, replaced by the paler, colder light of the moon.
 The trees were still graceful strands of light, but the breeze had changed to a harsh thing, one carrying new scents that somehow represented danger.
 Something inside me forced my limbs into motion.
 I was running before the first howl tore through the night.
 I was moving unimaginably fast, jumping fallen trees and bounding over other obstacles which even my improved vision struggled to make out in time for me to avoid them.

“Well, it’s just that I remember reading in the village about castles in the North.” Was I supposed to have read that?
 Had that been in the documents I had pilfered from the library?
 Shut up, Frey, shut up!
 They seemed to relax a little as Chevelle shook his head and brought his horse back to pace.
 I thought I knew what they were thinking.
 Idiot.
 Ruby answered, “Hmm,” with a cocked eyebrow as she turned to follow the group.
 They were mostly silent the rest of the day, until we stopped for the night.
 The group split after dinner as Anvil and Grey positioned themselves on rocks at the perimeter of our camp.
 Ruby hung out by Grey and Steed busied himself as Chevelle paced stiffly around the camp.

"They're jet skis.
 They're made for the water."
 She watched as the actors climbed towers, rode hand trolleys on cables, jumped from shattered platforms into the water.
 And when the heroine shot the villain, causing his jacket to catch on fire, Marie screamed.
 It was so real, and she gripped the edge of her seat as she waited to see what would happen after he fell into the water.
 The villain jumped up on the platform to make his bows with the rest of the cast.
 Marie raised wide eyes to Rick's face as they stood to leave.
 "Was that man who was on fire hurt?"
 "No.
 He'll do another show in a couple of hours."

The UN is precluded under article 2(7) of the Charter from intervening in ‘matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state’.
 It must be possible to define objective criteria for identifying instances in which action in apparent disregard of this provision is fully justified.
 The deaths of hundreds of thousands of people in Rwanda and Somalia due to famine, ethnic strife and civil war surely qualify, even if errors in the method of intervention, and lack of public support among nations asked to contribute troops, complicate these precedent-setting initiatives.
 The sovereignty of a nation derives ultimately from the fact that it represents the will of its own people and the right of those people to freedom of action over their own lives and territory.
 National sovereignty is limited on two sides: on the one, by the inalienable human rights of a country’s citizens and, on the other, by the rights of other member nations of the world community and the citizens they represent.
 In past centuries the sovereignty of nations may have been based on the principle that might is right.
 In our more enlightened age, however, the only acceptable basis for a nation’s sovereignty is that it expresses the will of its own people, and this condition can only be met under a freely chosen form of government that enables people to express their own free will and determine their own destiny.
 Therefore, the decision of the UN to insist on the operation of democratic processes in member countries is an essential step toward resolving the dilemma of sovereignty.
 When the representative nature of a national government is in question, its claim to sovereignty over its own people under all circumstances is also questionable.
 Hitherto, it has not been possible to address this issue forth rightly, because the evolution of the international community had not yet come to accept in practice, as opposed to merely in principle, the fundamental human rights so frequently espoused in constitutions and ignored in actions.

In “A Father’s Story”, he tells about Luke, a horse breeder who attempts to live in God’s will yet finds himself needing to choose between what he believes is right in God’s eyes and his daughter’s well-being.
 He chooses for the daughter.
 I confess to finding myself more sympathetic with Luke than with the patriarch Abraham.
 Soren Kierkegaard calls Abraham the Knight of Faith, a fellow so sure of God that even the idea of questioning a command to murder his own son was unthinkable.
 Good for him.
 Honest.
 Luke the horse breeder, I can admire, and Eric I can adore, in part because I know their flaws, their humanity.
 Luke's are exposed in "A Father's Story".
 Eric's I can remember, and for reminders, I have his report cards.
 Adoring a human may require us to have developed beyond pure selfishness.

He knew I was different, of course, knew of the magic, though I’d shown him nothing of my real power.
 But he didn’t understand I was an elf.
 I hadn’t explained, knowing it would do nothing but perplex his simple mind.
 He merely thought I was something special, extraordinary.
 But did he actually think I was human, marrigeable?
 I was incredulous.
 But he was obsessed.
 The moment it slipped from his lips, he became more focused on that than anything else.
 Making me his bride.
 I couldn’t understand.

We need to set you up outside of town.
 Chevelle is afraid we’re causing a scene in the village.” She laughed lightly.
 It seemed like she was having fun.
 I wondered if that meant she was causing trouble.
 “Don’t think he trusts you with the girl,” Ruby added, smiling playfully.
 “I prefer the outdoors anyway.” Steed dipped toward me, his hand folding his waist in a bow as he stood to go.
 “Sunshine.”
 My head was not up for this at all.

Others, though, looked at him strangely, clearly put off by the way he had won the melee.
 He felt a little unsteady, not sure what to make of both the welcome and the uncomfortable looks.
 As he passed through the doors in the main hearing chamber, the Grand Marshal stood at the far end waiting.
 In the chamber were both knights and squires.
 Many smiled; he thought a few looked like the ones in the hall, not sure what to think of this new knight.
 Rodregas was not surprised that when he started to kneel in front of the Grand Marshal, for Van’dret to step forward and speak.
 “Grand Marshal, you are not really thinking of knighting this fiend, are you?
 He killed a fellow squire out there.
 And he consorts with Nymphs and Infernals, not people of the Celestial Realm.
 You do the Order a disservice to make him a Knight of the Soaring Heavens.” Van’dret’s voice was slow and reasonable sounding and he spoke not so much to the Grand Marshal as to the audience.

It wasn't until I'd followed Isaac to my history class that I finally worked up the nerve to find out more of what was going on.
 Once the substitute had called roll, and then more or less turned the class loose for a 'group study session', I turned to Isaac and whispered my first question.
 "This fight between Alec and Brandon, it's for real?
 I mean they aren't just going to fight until first blood, are they?"
 Isaac's nod was hesitant, like he knew I was headed towards things he wasn't supposed to tell me.
 "I'm afraid the contest is quite serious, but still nothing for you to worry about."
 That didn't add up in the slightest.
 "I don't believe you.
 At least not the part about it not being anything to worry about.
 You all wouldn't have been so worried about Alec bringing me home Friday night if this was all no big deal.

The rocks streaked past us as we ran faster and faster, the wind whipping his mane.
 A great bird perched on the dead limb of an ironwood tree and I jumped to it just as it dropped from the branch and flared its wings out to catch the wind.
 We flew still farther as I watched the mountain pass below.
 There was a scrubby patch of trees ahead and I could see movement there, inside.
 I tried to focus on it… familiar silver and white.
 Commotion brought me back and I sat up, startled.
 My head spun.
 Ruby caught my arm to steady me.
 Her smile was strained as she handed me a drink of water.
 Chevelle was near the entrance of the stone room with Anvil and Grey.

When we rely on the inner resources, we achieve the maximum because we are constantly led to discover more of our own unlimited capacities.
 Why should we wait before acting until we are compelled by the irresistible force of the rising expectations of the world’s masses, by the explosion of violence in our cities, or by the complete breakdown of our economic systems because of spiralling unemployment?
 Why should we not act now to prevent these outcomes and reverse the trends that threaten to make them a reality?
 All the resources necessary are within our reach, within ourselves.
 We need the courage to think and say that it is time to abolish weapons of mass destruction and call a halt to the use of war for settlement of disputes, that it is time to insist that all people enjoy the most basic democratic freedoms, that there can and must be enough food produced to feed everyone, and that every person must be guaranteed the right to gainful employment.
 The barriers to these achievements are not material or technological.
 It takes money, materials and technology to make war, not to stop it.
 That requires a determination and insistence, an intolerance of violence, which must start with a commitment of the world’s leaders and the total empowerment of the UN to enforce peace.
 It takes material resources and technology to suppress people, not to make them free.
 That requires an acceptance of basic human rights as a non-negotiable minimum requirement for each nation to participate in the international community, which must start with a voluntary abdication by the great powers of the principle of rule by might that governs the present structure of the UN.

Rick snatched her up, hugging her fiercely.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart.
 I just love you so much."
 The words "I love you too" formed in her mind, but his tight embrace had knocked the breath out of her and kept the words from slipping out.
 "Rick," she gasped, "please put me down."
 He set her down and then took her face between his hands, raining kisses on her lips and cheeks and eyelids.
 "I love you so much."
 She put her hands on his chest and pushed away.
 "Let me catch my breath!"
 "I'm sorry."

Alec appeared immediately, paint-speckled and undeniably alive, from where he'd been working in his studio.
 "I really wish you'd just call for me when you need something.
 All of this moving around isn't going to help your back heal any more quickly."
 "You're not letting your injuries slow you down."
 It was a losing argument, but I hated being cooped up in bed all the time, and it was the only argument I had.
 Alec paused for a second to look down at the long, thick bandage wrapped around his middle.
 The gash of white cutting across his darkly tanned skin was uncomfortably similar to what I imagined his wound must have looked like just after Brandon had inflicted it.
 He sighed, but there wasn't any real frustration to the sound.
 "Our cases are hardly comparable.
 You know I heal more quickly than you do."

He tore his eyes from the fire, unable to withstand the strength of the image.
 The fire shrank back to a small blaze.
 “Most men cowered at the sight of it.
 Do not be ashamed,” Velixar said.
 “There might have been a victor, but Celestia interfered at last.
 She cast each god far beyond the sky, to where she herself had made a home.
 She gave half to Ashhur and half to Karak.
 The souls of the soldiers who fought and died alongside them were given to their masters.
 She cursed the elves who sided with Karak, branding them the ‘orcs,’ or ‘betrayers’ in her tongue.
 Once the brother gods were locked away from the world, and each other, Celestia issued her final decree.”

Rodregas then dropped his right sword as he kept his left engaged, pushing the blue steel sword away.
 Rodregas moved in and thrust out with his open hand with a speed the guard simply could not match nor have expected.
 Rodregas had the guard’s throat in his grasp before his opponent knew what was happening.
 The guard was not a big man and with his celestial strength Rodregas simply picked him up and squeezed.
 Rodregas felt the guard’s neck give under his grip.
 Before the slavers could react, Rodregas went from lifting him up to driving him down into the ground.
 Adrenaline was surging and suddenly Rodregas had a bloody mess in his hand.
 The guard was very dead.
 Rodregas let go of the broken neck and stood quickly, trying to clear himself of the gore.
 Both slavers looked shocked at what had happened and Rodregas moved quickly to take advantage of their surprise.

I wasn’t sure how to answer.
 But if it helped, if there was a way to unbind me, free my mind and get back the magic… I settled on a, “Mm-hm?” He nearly smiled.
 “Well, if you were able to… move about…” It seemed to make him uncomfortable, searching for words.
 “Then perhaps you could find a way around it.” I bit my lip and he reached up to gently pull it loose.
 His hand lingered, thumb tracing my bottom lip.
 I was definitely not imagining that.
 Warmth flooded my neck, my cheeks, and his gaze followed the flush.
 His hand dropped to my shoulder.
 “Please, Freya, try.” All I could do was nod.
 And then he stood and walked away.

"We're just enjoying having her back."
 "Of course."
 Davis took her hand, and they sat on the sofa.
 "How have you been, darling?"
 Marie gaped at him.
 How had she been?
 That was all he could say to her when he hadn't seen her for the past five weeks?
 "Fine, Davis.
 I've been fine."
 Freeing her hand, she moved away from him and retrieved her tea.

I could only think of one thing: Fight fire with fire.
 I flung my arm toward the incoming stream of flames and a tongue of fire akin to a dragon’s shot out and collided with it.
 I was shocked.
 I’d only used my power to light candles and lanterns.
 I’d had no idea I could produce such a vicious plume of flames.
 I looked to Chevelle.
 “Yes,” he exalted.
 He raised his arms above his head to construct a massive circle of blazing heat.
 When his eyes returned to mine, he smiled.
 He liked playing with fire.

She stayed defensive, parrying with all her skill while constantly dancing away.
 Harruq pressed closer, and every time the elf pulled out of a roll or landed from a leap backward, he was upon her.
 Notch after notch covered her staff as the swords chopped harder and harder.
 His strength grew as the fight progressed.
 He held nothing back.
 He weaved his swords through three stabs, feinted a high slash, and then twirled up and around for a low thrust.
 Aurelia fell for the feint and brought her staff up high, leaving her lower half exposed.
 Her slender frame twisted.
 A sword cut a thin line across the green fabric of her dress but did not touch skin.
 She thought Harruq might stop and claim the cut counted.

But success isn't the point.
 The point is, when we're stumped, or stuck, and we ask God, if an answer comes, we had better heed it.
 Okay, I think.
 I will write about reading Brother Lawrence and this trip before the next novel or anything else gets in my way.
 And by the end, I vow, I will know better how to adore God.
 Which, for reasons I’ll soon learn, turns me once again to thoughts of Eric.
 After a mile or so I’m questioning whether, on that Sunday as he walked over the hill between Sylvia's house and Kenny Niedermeyer's, Eric got handed the choice to save me and/or Billy, or to save himself.
 The only answer I receive is a maybe.
 But all I need is to recognize the long shot possibility that the dearest person I have known gave his life for me and, despite the sorrow, my heart leaps with adoration.
 For a moment on Highway 101 in Pismo Beach, I feel sure that Eric was Jesus.

You stumble in a fight and you are dead.
 With your center low you have control.
 You are ready to dodge and to strike back as needed.
 Plus, you have leverage.
 If you develop good foot work and keep them moving and you keep your center of gravity low, you can win against stronger but less-disciplined fighters.” They both nodded, for the moment convinced.
 “Now watch and try to learn this basic form.” Rodregas stepped into position; his knees deeply bent, his hands loose but raised just below his shoulders.
 He stepped forward and raised his left arm in a sweeping block and then he took another step and struck out in a swift blow to an imagined attacker with his right hand.
 While he followed a set form in his mind, he also saw his invisible attacker and he struck like he was really there, his blow stopping only when they met the invisible attacker’s form.
 After sharing a few basic blocks and strikes, he stopped and faced the other two again, and said, “Now, I will repeat that and then you two can take a turn.” Learning to fight through mastering one’s own form was new to both, and they struggled to follow his example.
 Doi’van often over reached any possible opponent, while Imeralda’s movements had little of real strength or violence behind them.

Her dark hair fell over his arm and onto the pillow, and he reached up with his free hand to caress it.
 Marie stirred, moving closer to Rick.
 She blinked and found him hovering over her.
 As she gazed up into his eyes, she felt as if she were in a dream.
 This was just like one of her fantasies.
 Except that he was wearing a shirt.
 "You fell asleep," he whispered, his face moving closer to hers.
 "Yes."
 "Me too."
 His lips brushed over hers.

 She hugged him hard and kissed his cheek.
 "Do you mean it?"
 "Of course I mean it.
 That would be a terrible joke."
 "Oh, Rick, thank you so much!

 She turned to go upstairs.
 "Whoa."
 He caught her hand, chuckling.

“Or was it you, Qurrah Tun?”
 He raced back to Woodhaven, his mind decided.
 It was time he had a talk with one of the brothers Tun.

 Harruq arrived at the sparring point in the forest less disheveled than the previous day, and he seemed in better spirits.
 “So what is your surprise for me?” he asked.
 Aurelia smiled from her seat against a tree.
 She patted the grass beside her.
 “Have a seat.

“How long will they offer that much coin?”
 Qurrah popped his neck, wincing as he did.
 “So be it,” he conceded.
 “Take the work…‌if they’ll take you.”

 “Course they will,” he muttered, his frown betraying the confidence in his voice.

Maybe one or two will be okay once I've touched them up, but this brochure is proving tougher than expected.
 Can we talk after dinner?"
 By now I really should have been used to Mom ignoring me when she got buried in a project.
 I shrugged and went upstairs to change.
 Hours later, having finished up all my homework and endured the agony of dinner, I was finally free to do whatever I wanted with the last few minutes of my night.
 My room was still miserable, but with Mom sitting down in the living room with her laptop going through the gigs of data that she'd shot over the last few days, it offered the only real chance at some time alone.
 I trudged up the stairs, shut my door, and then realized I wasn't sure what to do with myself.
 I'd spent most of the time since we'd arrived either buried in homework, or borderline catatonic.
 The obvious choice was sitting on the rickety table next to my bed, but I wasn't sure if I was up to Les Misérables right now.
 Maybe in a few weeks, once the production had left Vegas, I'd be ready to delve back into it.

 CHAPTER 3 THE RAVEN TOWER
 Rodregas stepped into the master’s bedroom for the first time in his twenty years of service in Raven Tower.
 He was unarmed; unarmored and needed to get as far away from Raven Keep as he could before someone noticed that he was not a sorcerer.
 He had spent too much time on the road without money, and he was not going to repeat the experience if he could help it.
 He needed money.
 Money would buy him what he needed to start his new life.
 Unfortunately, Ravenhurr had not been interested in material wealth, and what money he did have, he tended to spend on materials needed for his magical ceremonies; still there should be something that he could use.
 The bedroom was not large but this floor also held Ravenhurr’s study and a water closet.

Choosing instead a rambling, rarely used path out of the village, I found myself wandering idly through the trees and, eventually, into an abandoned, overgrown garden, where I tried to work out what to do with my now empty afternoon.
 Sitting surrounded by the various weeds, my tutor might have urged me to do something useful, like identify the species, but she wasn’t here, and I couldn’t help but attempt to repeat the process I’d used on the thistle in her study.
 I’d been warned not to practice without supervision, but the field felt alone as I concentrated on one weed and then on each of the others, spinning my charms in an attempt to develop them.
 I had no luck with the wild flowers and renegade vegetable plants, but a small thorn tree and a couple of noxious strains began to mature in response to the magic.
 All this time, I’d thought something was broken in me, that something had happened when I’d lost my mother, but maybe Junnie was right.
 Maybe I’d just needed to get my focus, to work until it came through.
 “Well, well, what do we have here?
 Is Elfreda making magic?” Evelyn’s sourness burned through me.
 It took everything I had to curb my reply, keep myself out of trouble.
 “Oh, uh, I didn’t realize… is this your…” I was struggling to answer.

I only caught his eyes for a few seconds before he looked away, but even his normally riveting blue eyes couldn't distract me from my inability to identify the look.
 I was used to people disliking me, ignoring me, or even occasionally liking me, but this was the first time I'd met someone who seemed to be still trying to decide what camp to join long past the time when most kids our age would have either made a decision or just decided I was weird and started ignoring me.
 Britney seemed to be getting suspicious that I wasn't really listening, so I had to make a lot of eye contact over the next few minutes.
 When I finally got a chance to look back up, Alec and his friends weren't at their table.
 Cassie caught my eye before I looked down, but she was definitely glaring.
 Not the typical I-hate-you-and-I'm-going-to-do-everything-I-can-to-smear-your-reputation-and-get-you-in-trouble-because-we're-in-high-school-and-that's-all-I can-really-do type glaring.
 Instead her eyes seemed to warn me never to go out alone at night because if she ever found me somewhere without any witnesses, they were going to have to hospitalize me.
 I felt a chill run through me, and dropped my eyes out of involuntary reflex.
 I probably would've started shaking if someone hadn't grabbed my shoulder and startled some kind of twisted cross between a shriek and a gasp out of me.
 I turned to give whoever it was a piece of my mind, but Brandon's laughing gray eyes made the words tangle up before they made it down to my tongue.

She’d like cherries and whipped cream on it.
 She’d go shopping with her mother and maybe have lunch in town.
 After lunch she’d come home to take a nap.
 The house would be hot in the afternoon.
 “Don’t forget to pick up the dry cleaning!” Marie jumped, looking up to see who’d yelled.
 A car door slammed, and she saw a sleek gray car back out of a driveway.
 She’d wandered far from Rick’s house .

 "It felt kind of like a game of capture the flag, with me as the flag."
 It wasn't the most flattering comparison ever invented, but at least it allowed me to try and convince myself I'd imagined the near-violence.

"So, tell me about yourself."
 "There isn't much to tell.
 I was born here, and I'll probably die here."
 "More of the obligations you were talking about?"
 Brandon nodded, staring off in the distance for a second.
 "Yeah.
 It sounds pretentious, but a lot of people depend on my family.
 Half the businesses in the town are owned by my family, the other half are owned by Alec's mother."
 The revelation was a bit of a shock.
 I'd known all along they were both ridiculously rich, but them owning the livelihood of nearly every person in the town was mind-boggling.

 She had parents she loved, parents she knew were worried about her.

A surprisingly adorable-looking nerd in jeans and a tee-shirt ducked out of our way, and I felt a pang of sympathy.
 He was the kind of boy Mom pointed out when she surfaced from one of her projects.
 She hadn't ever managed to really pique my interest in any boy, but I could see how a few years from now, he'd probably be fairly popular among college girls.
 Britney stopped before one of the top lockers and started spinning the tumbler.
 She was still relating some story about her old school, but suddenly I couldn't hear a word.
 The crowd of students had drifted to the sides of the hall, like worshipers making way for a pair of pagan gods.
 Even so, there still wasn't quite room for them to walk side by side.
 The girl was leading.
 Her dark, wavy hair and flawless skin would've made her pretty in any crowd, but she also had perfectly symmetrical features and one of those bodies that required hours each day in the gym to maintain.
 I wanted to hate her.

 “Should we head out there?” “I think we should,” she replied.
 “We have nowhere else to go.”
