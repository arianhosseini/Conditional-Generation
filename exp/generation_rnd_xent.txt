The idea that hunger cannot be conquered because we are running out of land to support rapidly burgeoning populations is contradicted by the facts.
 Globally, there is no correlation between population density and hunger.
 China, with only half as much arable land per capita as India, produces 13 per cent more foodgrains per capita.
 Taiwan and South Korea have only half the farmland per capita of Bangladesh, yet they produce 40 per cent more food per capita.
 Tiny Netherlands, with the highest population density in the world, produces more than sufficient food to feed itself and remain a large net food exporter.
 Currently 11 per cent of the world‚Äôs land surface is used for agricultural crops, just 4 per cent more than in 1960.
 A comprehensive theoretical study of soils, climate, vegetation and topography conducted in 1975 indicated that both land and water utilized for agriculture could be doubled, if necessary, and that the earth could support 36 times the 1975 level (18 times the 1990 level) of cereal production using the same share of cultivated land.
 There would be severe practical obstacles to such a vast expansion of croplands, but these findings suggest that physical limitations to food production are not the primary constraints.
 A more commonly accepted estimate indicates that the world‚Äôs land and water used for agriculture could more than double.

But by themselves these steps will only mitigate the most pernicious threats to international security.
 They will not provide an effective system for ensuring the peace and security of all nations that is so vitally needed, and now so imminently possible, as a basis for accelerating the political, economic and social development of humankind.
 The end of the Cold War provides us with the opportunity, and pressing global issues provide the urgency, for more significant measures.
 These measures cannot be conceived within the perspective of international security that has dominated our thinking in the post-war period, or from a half-hearted desire to modestly improve what to some still appears an adequate and acceptable system.
 This is an occasion that demands visionary and courageous leadership to usher in a better world.
 The children of the next millennium will judge us by our response.
 Historically, all landmark changes in the international political and security system have been the result of armed conflicts, wars and revolutions.
 In each case the victors who emerged from the ashes of war sought to build on a static formula for enforcing peace in a dynamic world.
 In each case, the arrangements for conflict termination contained a dynamism that would produce the tensions, disputes and conflicts of the future.
 These in-built limitations and imbalances resist adjustment until a new round of fighting sweeps away the old frame work and replaces it with another, fashioned in much the same way.

Would Anvil use the same method on a person?
 A thunderous crack answered my unspoken question.
 The lightning bolt was faster than my eyes at such a close distance, by the time I looked at Steed, there was nothing but a wall of water.
 He had constructed a barrier of sorts, caught the strike and redirected it around himself by melting the snow that spotted the mountain.
 Anvil was winded, though the strike wasn‚Äôt as severe as his previous show.
 Steed would unquestionably be the winner now and as he took aim to retaliate, his opponent raised his hands in surrender.
 ‚ÄúQuick thinking, Mister Summit.‚Äù The large man grinned and I was in no doubt they were old friends.
 Chevelle stepped forward then, eager.
 I had a feeling he‚Äôd been itching for this the way I‚Äôd been itching to burn Ruby.
 Steed smiled in acceptance, but not the same smile he‚Äôd given his last opponent.

I closed the door behind me, and though tired, knew I wouldn‚Äôt sleep with him in the next room.
 I walked to the back window and stared out into the night.
 Moonlight glinted off Ruby‚Äôs figure in the distance, heading away from the village.
 I didn‚Äôt think.
 I just pulled a cloak from the pile on her bed and was out the hidden door behind the wardrobe.
 I ran in a crouch, praying no one spotted me as I gained on her.
 I only once glanced at the house in the fear I wouldn‚Äôt be able to find my way back.
 If I wanted to catch Ruby, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to mark my path.
 Her cloaked form leapt over a tall rock and disappeared.
 I hurried forward, sure I was about to lose both her and the route.

I had been thinking about my discussion with Steed, but hadn‚Äôt decided how to respond if I were asked again about the incident in the clearing, about controlling the snake.
 No one knew about the hawk and I wasn‚Äôt sure how I had done it to begin with, so I couldn‚Äôt exactly explain it.
 It would have been like explaining how to wiggle your ears to someone who wasn‚Äôt able.
 But it had been easy for me, much easier than fire even.
 I drew my cloak tighter around my shoulders and yawned as I considered my horse.
 I‚Äôd had so much trouble learning to control him, trying to push him from the outside.
 Falling back from the group only enough not to gain notice, I tried to settle into his mind as I had the snake and the hawk.
 I closed my eyes, trusting him to avoid running into anything, though a low limb was the more likely problem.
 It was more difficult and‚Ä¶ different.
 I was there though, leading him and seeing what he saw.

 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fantastic,‚Äù she breathed.
 He smiled at her.
 Steed was following.
 ‚ÄúAlmost unbelievable,‚Äù he added, shooting me a look.

 They didn‚Äôt approach but stopped just inside the room and dipped into a bow.

Her long hair covered a lot of the two of them but really hid nothing.
 He met her large green eyes and said, ‚ÄúYou amaze me.
 I knew you were brave and courageous, but now I know where your true magic talent is...‚Äù He looked at her eyes as he spoke and even when he smiled at his own words, he let her see the sincerity of what he said.
 The main rule of flattery with women is to never lie.
 It was a lesson taught to Rodregas by a lost love, and one that had served him well over the years.
 Most women can always tell a lie, especially in such a moment of connection as the talk after good sex.
 Luckily, even with far more normal women there is always something good you can say; with Imeralda he could have gone on for hours.
 Imeralda‚Äôs eyes lit up in pleasure and humor at his words but, of course, he was careful to say nothing of the future, nothing of love.
 Such talk would serve no purpose and would likely ruin the moment.
 To his surprise she also kept such thoughts to herself.

I wanted to force the issue, wanted it so badly I could feel the desire bubbling inside me, but even more than my natural shyness, the thought of him pulling away again, this time in disgust, was too much to contemplate.
 Once we got to school, I'd found the rampant gossip had subsided to a dull rumble, but the few undecided votes had come down solidly on the side of everyone else.
 Some people hated me for using Brandon, others hated me for playing Alec, while a small, but decidedly upwardly-mobile group disliked me for achieving not just one, but both of the conquests they'd been dreaming of since grade school.
 In the end, it didn't really matter why everyone disliked me.
 Still, only the fact that Alec's pack closed ranks around me kept the situation from becoming unbearable.
 Biology went better than it had since my first day in Sanctuary, largely because Alec seemed to have developed a postdoctorate knowledge of Biology.
 Also he didn't have a single qualm when it came to using that knowledge to deflect questions aimed at me.
 Mrs. Sorenson tried three different times to make me look stupid before finally giving up and getting down to the business of teaching.
 She continued to shoot us nasty looks throughout the class, but I hardly noticed.
 Alec spent the rest of the class time writing questions for me in the margins of my notebook.

Meeting Lisa is the most important defining moment in my life.
 Acknowledgments I would like to thank all of the drug and alcohol rehabilitation professionals who choose to tackle the daunting task of attempting to help those in this world who cannot take just one drink but must consume the whole bottle and those who cannot take a prescription pill as prescribed but must crush, snort, smoke or inject these powerful drugs to feed the monster of addiction.
 Many of these counselors and staff who help the addicts in our lives were once addicts themselves.
 They choose to ‚Äúgive back‚Äù because they have either finally come to understand what caused them to want to destroy themselves and are compelled to share this knowledge or they know that they can only continue their sobriety by staying where they found it, or both.
 Either way, they are the students who became the teachers of recovery and only they are bullet proof to the lies that flow so freely from an addict‚Äôs mouth.
 I would like to thank the staff of Narconon and every other facility that helps our addicts attempt to identify and handle the demon they cannot resist.
 I would like to thank Chris Tillman for encouraging me to turn my cathartic writings into a book to share my story with others.
 I would like to thank my mother for being the best mother she could be despite astronomical obstacles that faced a single parent in the 60‚Äôs with no financial support from her first husband and an abusive second husband.
 Mom, we never knew how hard life was for you because you made sure we came first and you protected us the best you could!
 To my son Bryce, I would like to thank you for all of your accomplishments and helping me as a father not have a complete melt down because at least I knew I wasn‚Äôt a complete failure as a Dad.

 It all crashed down on me, the weight of the whole situation.

The remaining contents consisted of drawings, pictures and other personal items.
 Rodregas dumped the trunk contents on the floor, sandwiched the armor in the blankets and loaded up the trunk.
 How he was going to cart the trunk out of the tower he did not yet know.
 He went to the door and listened; it seemed to be getting quieter.
 It was the middle of the night and the stir from the ceremony seemed to have subsided, but it was only hours until dawn when everyone would be heading out to celebrate the new ‚Äòbirth‚Äô of Ravenhurr.
 Not a true celebration for most; as their lord and master, ‚Äòhe‚Äô was more feared than loved.
 Rodregas locked the door to prevent a surprise.
 He should have done that before; it was sloppy of him not to take such a simple precaution.
 Asking Captain Poir to send up Adapt Korin had been totally unplanned.
 He had been dreaming of killing Korin for all the 18 years that he had served in the tower.

For food and spending money, we foraged for soda bottles and redeemed them.
 With my share, I bought just enough beer so the proprietor of a smaller Bourbon Street bar allowed me to remain on a stool from which I admired a certain barmaid.
 She reminded me of Karen Flagstad.
 Not in her looks.
 She was taller and red haired.
 But in her expression, I read the same message I got from Karen‚Äôs sweet face.
 It said, I‚Äôve been hurt bad and know how it feels so I‚Äôll be nice to everybody and try not to make anybody else feel that way.
 A thousand and some miles from home, I was lonely enough to once again ache for a best friend.
 So while I admired this barmaid, who looked about three months pregnant, I dreamed she and I would roam until we discovered the right small town, where we didn‚Äôt know anybody.
 There she could leave behind the sorrow of getting ditched by the creep who knocked her up.

They will be generated across all sectors of the economy, most especially in construction, transportation and utilities, education and health services, wholesale trade, and financial services.
 Employment is not a zero sum game.
 Computerization: The exciting growth of ICT-based service exports by no means exhausts the potential contribution of computers to growth of employment opportunities.
 Computerization is not merely a field or sector of commercial activity.
 The computer is an instrument and a catalyst that can stimulate creation of employment and self-employment opportunities in virtually every field ‚Äì from farming, fishing and textile designing to lean manufacturing, financial services, bio-informatics and genetic engineering.
 While the application of computers has already been extended to all these fields, there has not yet been a systematic effort to assess the employment potential that can be tapped by fully extending and accelerating this movement.
 The recent initiative in India to establish knowledge centres in every Indian village by 2007 is one example of a pioneering effort to harness ICT as a means to catalyze a whole range of on-farm and off-farm rural activities, which will inevitably translate into more and higher productivity and greater employment generation.
 These centres can be utilized to deliver technological expertise to upgrade farm yields, vocational training and education, purchasing and marketing information to raise incomes.
 The experience of India also shows that bridging the digital divide helps to bridge the gender divide in the area of knowledge and skill-intensive work.
 As the construction of rural roads acts as a stimulus to agricultural development of isolated communities by connecting them with sources of inputs and markets in the outer world, ICT can be a catalyst for stimulating the entire gamut of economic activities in rural communities throughout the developing world.

 Velixar drew out his magical chest.
 He set it beside him and let it grow out to normal size.
 From within he pulled out a suit of armor stained a deep shade of black.
 He threw it to Harruq, who managed to catch it even though his mouth hung wide open.
 ‚ÄúThe first Horde War was caused by a disciple of mine,‚Äù the man in black explained.
 ‚ÄúHe blessed the armor of one of the leaders of the orcish clans.

It was too unbelievable to be real.
 I took a couple more steps, and then looked to my left and was rewarded as an infectious grin slowly appeared on Brandon's face.
 I wanted to say something witty, but the thoughts all just swirled around in my head without making it down to my mouth.
 Brandon's smile grew just a little bigger.
 "I really think you should let me give you a ride home.
 Based on our past history, it's only a matter of time before one of us runs into the other, and I'm afraid of what my Mustang might do to you when that happens."
 Brandon's voice washed over me like silk, carrying away any desires I might have had to walk all the way home just to prove a point.
 Not trusting my voice, I nodded and took the couple of steps needed to reach his passenger door.
 "I wanted to apologize for what happened earlier today.

A thorough examination of facts and a dispassionate analysis reveal grounds for hope and opportunities for action.
 The possibility of more rapid economic growth and rising incomes in both developed and developing countries ‚Äì spurred by further substantial reduction in defence spending, the diffusion and application of new technologies, economic liberalization leading to growth of international trade, the globalization of financial markets, and the emergence of new engines for global expansion among developing countries ‚Äì indicates that our apprehensions need not prove justified, provided society acts courageously and decisively to meet the challenge.
 A global overview of employment cannot do full justice to the special circumstances, problems and potentials of specific regions and countries, but it can dispel the growing concern that employment has become a problem beyond the means of governments or the global economy to eradicate or even contain.
 In the final analysis, creation of jobs for all is not a question of possibility.
 It is a question of necessity.
 Neither logic nor self-interest justify a detached attitude or a half-hearted effort to address this issue.
 As in the case of the recent global response to the threat of global warming from depletion of the ozone layer, it simply is not acceptable for us to remain indifferent or claim that we are powerless to act where the entire world‚Äôs vital self-interests are at stake.
 When war threatens a nation‚Äôs borders, technology threatens its environment or unemployment threatens the livelihood of its people and the fabric of its social existence, there is only one acceptable response ‚Äì that is, action.
 The greatest achievement of this century has not been technological, economic or political, but rather the growing concern and intolerance for the slaughter, persecution or impoverishment of other human beings.
 This marks the awakening of our collective, human consciousness to the full value of human life and the consequent rejection of physical strength, political power and money as the governing values of society.

With the pain so unbearable, he dared not cough against the liquid that came burning down.
 Some of it went into his lungs, but he kept them still.
 Qurrah reclined, closed his eyes, and let the potion do its work.
 He could feel the magic flowing through his body, concentrating about his ruined throat.
 Part of him hoped the liquid would heal the damage done so many years ago, but he knew better.
 A scar that old was beyond repair.
 He would have to settle for surviving.
 That was just fine with him.
 When he finally dared a loud, gasping breath of air, the pain was not so bad.
 Qurrah stood, picked up his whip, and then went to help his brother.

We were still working on statistics, which was nice in that I could follow what was being said and wasn't falling any further behind, but kind of a bummer because it meant I couldn't do a bunch of makeup work during class.
 It was a relief when Mrs. Campbell finally capped her marker and turned us loose to work on the homework assignment.
 I was midway through the first assignment when one of the aides slipped into the room and whispered into Mrs. Campbell's ear.
 There was a kind of muted, collective gasp that made me look up just in time to see the color drain out of her face.
 Before the aide had even finished whispering, Mrs. Campbell was out of her chair and headed towards the door.
 Thirty seconds later we were all still looking around and wondering what had happened.
 It was a testament to our respect for, or in some cases fear of, Mrs. Campbell that nobody spoke in anything above a whisper for an entire five minutes.
 Every terrible thing that could possibly happen to a person flowed through my mind, and all I could do was hope I was overreacting.
 Mrs. Campbell had scared me a little that first day, but she'd been pretty nice since, and she'd always been fair.
 "So what do you think happened?"

 Brandon ran one finger down the side of my face, and then leaned back with a smile as I reached for the door.
 It wasn't until I was out of the car that I realized our Jeep was parked in its normal spot off to the side of the house.
 Excited to talk to Mom about her last outing, I waved goodbye to Brandon and hurried to the door.

 Whew, no need to go through the third degree about Brandon.
 "Anything promising, Mom?"
 "Hmm?

 I didn't want to see the mess my water had made of his shirt, so I started at the top and worked my way down.
 I'd seen better hair in a couple of fashion magazines, but not very many.
 Casually windswept, straight blond hair had become iconic sometime in the last few years, and this boy either spent an hour on his hair each morning, or the wind in Utah was kinder and gentler than the wind in Minnesota.
 Kinder, and currently working on its cosmetology license.
 His skin was exquisitely tanned, lighter than Jasmin or Alec's, but exactly suited to his lighter hair tone.
 Friendly gray eyes perfectly spaced above some of the most natural looking white teeth I'd ever seen.
 My heart would have started slowing down if I'd been sure the display of teeth was a smile, but there was something about the expression that defied classification.
 Gritting my teeth slightly I let my gaze continue on down to assess the damage, only I couldn't.
 I could see the wet spots on the shirt.

I'd actually been trying to sneak a look in the mirror to find out how everything was shaping up, but it wasn't worth trying to explain.
 With the pall that'd descended over the pack once we'd made it back, it was almost certain she wouldn't believe me.
 Nobody even knew where we'd gone, but they'd keyed off of our mood faster than I would've believed possible.
 The results hadn't been good.
 Jasmin stepped back around behind Dominic as I was watching, and for the first time I got a good idea of how the massively piled style Jasmin had been working on for the last half hour was going to turn out.

 "Oh no, I really look that horrid?"

 Rodregas watched a few of the other matches before it was his turn again.
 Except for him, everyone remaining wore full plate.
 Rodregas‚Äô next opponent was shining in the sun in his steel; which was better than him having to face Night Bronze plate, but still not very reassuring.
 The flag fell and Rodregas dug his heals into Doom Hoof‚Äôs side and the mount plodded forward.
 His opponent‚Äôs horse looked almost as powerful, but much faster.
 The collision happened before Rodregas was fully expecting it and he felt himself hit the ground and hit it hard.
 ‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù Rodregas muttered to himself, ‚ÄúHe has a Dire Steed and full plate armor.‚Äù Rodregas rolled over and pushed himself up, Doom Hoof stood nosing the sand looking for food.
 ‚ÄúThe damned beast should be pulling plows not in a tournament for knighthood.‚Äù Rodregas thought.
 Rodregas‚Äô opponent was starting to turn around, probably to ask for his surrender.

He led them into an alley in between several worn buildings made of stone.
 He stopped just before the next set of homes, for he heard talking.
 Holding Qurrah back, he peered around the corner to find a soldier dressed in finely polished armor raising his sword in salute.
 At first Harruq did not see who he saluted, but an elf fell from the roof and landed before the soldier.
 ‚ÄúAn elf,‚Äù Harruq whispered, managing to grab Qurrah‚Äôs attention.
 Now both peered around the corner, curious why such an exotic creature had arrived mere seconds before war.
 ‚ÄúGreetings, Dieredon,‚Äù the soldier hailed, pulling off his helmet.
 He was a middle-aged, blond-haired man who had numerous scars on his face.
 ‚ÄúGreetings to you as well, guard captain Antonil,‚Äù Dieredon said, taking a step back and kneeling.
 ‚ÄúThough I fear greetings is all I may offer you.‚Äù

 "We need to go.
 One of Brandon's people just got close enough to smell us.
 They left before we could tell for sure who it was, but the odds of them coming back with lots of help just went through the roof.
 If we're still around when they do, things will get ugly."
 Part of me wanted to break down into a gibbering wreck.
 The rest of me just nodded calmly, and turned to head upstairs as Isaac politely passed me, apparently on his way to the kitchen.
 Alec gently grasped my shoulder before I'd even managed to take a step.
 "There isn't time.
 We have to go now."

And, even if we never performed any of it, which we didn‚Äôt, they were my songs, and they were popping up on the radio.

 Not much has been made of that connection, but John, early on, taught me the logistics of writing for money, of getting my stuff with one of the music publishers.
 A lot of artists did this, you know, kind of like what Dylan was doing with The Basement Tapes, except that took on a whole life of its own, because it was Bob.
 So, I did some demos, at Ardent with Jim‚Äôs help, and others, I just wrote, you know, just committed them to paper and John helped me get them disseminated.
 It worked well then to do that.
 I don‚Äôt know if it still does.
 Probably, though I don‚Äôt do that anymore.

Rodregas was an Immortalist in fact, if not a member of the Guild, and he was pretty sure most of the knights would kill him if they found out his story.
 ‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt some wizards have the secrets for some of the lesser sigils?‚Äù asked Doi‚Äôvan, joining the conversation.
 ‚ÄúI thought a lot of them used ones that help wizards not to grow old.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat is true,‚Äù said Imeralda with a shrug.
 ‚ÄúA healing sigil is why wizards live so long.
 It is considered by most to be the moral choice instead of the Immortalists‚Äô answer for long life.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat about you Doi‚Äôvan?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 ‚ÄúImeralda says that you are almost as powerful as me as a magician.
 If we found a way, would you like to take on some of the power of the sigils?‚Äù he asked.
 Rodregas had expected an immediate response, but instead his question was followed by a long pause before Doi‚Äôvan answered.
 Rodregas had learned that Doi‚Äôvan thought before speaking.
 ‚ÄúI am not sure.

But if you can stop and turn, take a few more shots.
 If they again turn and charge, you run and don‚Äôt stop running.
 Forget the horses; you will be much harder to track without them.‚Äù He was about to ask Imeralda how long until they would arrive, when Rodregas started to hear noises from up the road.
 The party carrying the captives had arrived.
 Rodregas held a finger to his lips and waved Imeralda deeper into the trees.
 With any luck she would be safe; it was hard to catch a Forest Nymph who was trying not to be found in the trees.
 Doi‚Äôvan stepped partly out of the shrubs and got behind a tree to give him cover against return fire.
 There was a good-size tree not far in front of the two of them.
 Rodregas put his back to it and drew his two short swords and then did the most difficult thing he could do in this situation.
 He looked at Doi‚Äôvan and not at the caravan.

 Alec looked back up at me, and his eyes were filled with incredible need.
 I was suddenly struck by the similarities to the me he'd painted, and what I saw written on his face.
 It seemed impossible he would be unsure, that a glorious being like him could ever need anything I could provide, but I couldn't deny it was there.
 There was no way of knowing what it was, but I didn't care.
 Whatever it was he needed I wanted to give him.
 I opened my mouth to say as much, but my vocal chords wouldn't cooperate.
 I was still trying to verbalize my feelings, when his free hand came down to my chin and gently pulled it up.

Prosperity, which eliminates hunger, also tends to eliminate violence.
 Even in war-ravaged Africa, experience shows that where food is plentiful, war is avoided.
 The converse is also true.
 Historically, war and civil strife have been the single greatest cause of famines.
 In addition to destroying crops and food supplies, it disrupts food distribution through the use of sieges and blockades.
 In the past decade, war has had a greater impact on food supplies in Africa, particularly the Sahelian region, than have the severe droughts that periodically plague the continent.
 Freedom from hunger and political freedom go hand in hand.
 As subsistence agriculture and periodic famine were the economic foundations of monarchy and feudalism, the generation of agricultural surpluses that stimulated commercialism, and later industrialization, have formed the basis for the rise of democratic institutions.
 Greater freedom for individual action and ownership both stimulate and are supported by greater productivity in agriculture.
 Authoritarian government is frequently either the result or the cause of food shortages ‚Äì its use of force justified on the one hand to meet a crisis situation or necessitated on the other to restore order and initiate emergency measures.

 At this Rodregas saw many people nodding, but he remained silent.
 It was not his turn to answer any question other than from the Grand Marshal.
 The Marshal Faurrenida voice made his displeasure and his dislike of arguing with a non-knight clear as he said, ‚ÄúWhile a knight has the full right to enter both the Lesser and Greater Sigil Chambers and take and sigil as his level of magic might allow, it is not a sigil he earns today.
 It is knighthood.
 Now, the discussion is over.‚Äù growled Marshal Faurrenida.
 To forestall any further argument, the Grand Marshal stepped forward quickly and drew his sword.
 The sword gleamed of the highest quality blue steel and red fire seemed to run its length.

 You expect that kind of energy in a child; when it comes from an adult it's hard not to react in kind.
 It didn't manage to infect me this time, but it did help focus me on the here and now.
 I figured I owed her for that, so I tried to suppress my generally ungracious nature.
 I even let her lead me up the creaky stairs to show me the 'amazing view' for the third time.
 Mom pulled the mirrors out of my hands as soon as I reached the larger bedroom, and nudged me towards the window.
 "Admit it, Adri, we didn't get sunsets like this very often in Minnesota."
 "Adriana," I corrected automatically, trying to avoid thinking about where my nickname had come from.

America‚Äôs share of trade with low-wage countries represents only 3 per cent of GDP, compared to 2 per cent in 1960.
 For the OECD as a whole, imports from low-wage countries represent only 1.5 per cent of total expenditure on goods and services.
 On the other hand, there is irrefutable evidence that expanding international trade creates large numbers of jobs, even in high-wage economies.
 The real issue, therefore, is whether the overall balance favours net job creation or net job destruction for each nation and for the global economy.
 On this issue the evidence is clear.
 Protectionism reduces overall economic welfare, often hurting those with the lowest incomes.
 In the long term greater international trade, like technology, expands overall employment opportunities substantially.
 Trade also counters the tendency of prices to increase along with incomes in more developed countries.
 Living standards rise as consumers benefit from the availability of lower-priced imported consumer goods.
 One of the greatest barriers to solving the world‚Äôs employment problem is the perception that trade destroys jobs.

My control had progressed a good deal since my training had begun; it seemed almost easy to navigate a small flame.
 I smoothed it out into a line and traced arcs and then more intricate designs.
 The designs started to resemble portraits and I had to concentrate hard to keep from seeing them, so I focused on landscapes, but those grew from tiny village houses and trees to rolling hills and curving creeks.
 Before long, the hills rose to mountains that melted into unidentifiable monsters.
 I snuffed the flame with a wave and the den was black with night.
 Eventually, the clouds broke and the soft glow of moonlight filtered in through the opening.
 I leaned onto an elbow to examine the glistening patches of light on the skin of my outstretched hand, twisting it from day to night, pale to dark.
 Weary and trancelike, I lowered my head, tucking my arm back as a pillow, and fell into a deep sleep.

"Actually I was completely serious.

 I waited for the inevitable joke, or backhanded compliment to follow, but he seemed happy to just stop there.
 For once in my life I managed to be smart and do the same.
 "So what's the agenda for today?"
 Alec stretched and then shrugged.
 "School, just like every Monday."
 My groan brought a smile to his face.
 "I can ship pesky parents out of the country, but if you start a wholesale program of cutting class your mom will find out when she gets back."
 "So I just go about my day like normal, pretending like I don't know Brandon's a psychopath who just happens to be able to change shapes at will and rip big holes in brick walls?"

Harruq halted before the mess that had been his prey.
 The line of undead stood motionless, their unfocused eyes looking nowhere.
 The wind blew through them, shifting their hair and whistling through the holes in their bodies.
 The half- orc said nothing, just stared at the carnage and the servants of his master as he waited for Qurrah.
 The mindless rage that had consumed him slowly faded.
 By the time his brother arrived, it was all but a memory.
 ‚ÄúThe undead took them,‚Äù Qurrah said, his breath quick and shallow.
 ‚ÄúVelixar did not trust us.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI trust little,‚Äù Velixar said, stepping through the line of his servants.
 ‚ÄúThe truth is I do not take risks.

At once, my stomach was a knot again.
 We rode into town at a walk; Chevelle was sitting straight and tall in his saddle but his arm hung casually, hand resting on his leg.
 I was more comfortable watching him, looking for a reaction, than the passing elves.
 Two men walked by in the opposite direction, their dark eyes on us.
 My cape blew back, exposing the shape of my leg, and they hissed indecent comments.
 I gasped, shocked, and my horse picked up its pace to ride beside Chevelle.
 Chevelle held up two fingers slightly to silence me.
 We hadn‚Äôt ridden more than a quarter of the way into town when he turned the horses to a medium-sized structure, stopping before a water trough.
 He dismounted effortlessly and pulled me from my horse and into the building in a few quick steps, closing the door behind us.
 It was dark inside, his fingers lingering on my arm.

 The ghosts of the village clung to his back and neck.

 The thought of council brought the danger of my situation to the forefront.
 ‚ÄúNo.

 They were quiet the rest of the evening, but as I dozed by the fire, their conversation restarted in hushed voices.
 I tried to listen, but exhaustion won out and their words began to meld into dreams.
 I could hear them as I was drifting, floating in a great shadowed lake.

I, however, was jumped on by something entirely new.
 They were small and stubby, the size of dwarfs or gnomes.
 Their skin was shriveled and grey, and hung off their bodies like cold clothing.
 Their eyes were a bright yellow that matching their teeth and their fingers looked like gnarly old trees.
 And the smell; it was awful.
 They grabbed my feet, back and tugged at my hair.

Peace building has thus far been defined as post-conflict actions to support reconstruction and to strengthen and solidify peace.
 The concept needs to be broadened to include pre-conflict actions and expanded to encompass a wider array of potentially destabilizing factors that lead to conflicts.
 The Commission supports the establishment of an International Centre jointly operated by the UN Security Council and UNESCO to implement peace-building programmes.
 Peace-building activities should be expanded to address security threats issuing from environmental degradation, poverty, migration of population and refugees.
 Many cases of ethnic conflict have an under lying basis of economic deprivation that must be addressed before tensions will permanently subside.
 Others can be mitigated by the introduction of positive economic incentives for cooperation.
 Economic cooperation is already dissipating ethnic tensions and conflict in the Middle East.
 It can be creatively fostered in the Balkans and elsewhere.
 In other cases, the modification of the electoral and constitutional systems in a culturally appropriate manner can reduce or eliminate tensions in ethnically divided countries.
 International assistance is also needed for coping with tensions arising from the sharing of natural resources ‚Äì particularly water resources ‚Äì and chemical or radioactive pollution of air, soil and waterways.

I was taken aback with his sudden intensity, and part of me wanted to bristle at the implication I couldn't be trusted with a secret.
 His expression softened a little as he reached into the small bag mounted on the fuel tank, and handed me a bottle of water.
 I hadn't even realized I was thirsty until that second.
 "I'm sorry, Adriana.
 I know I can depend on you, this is just important enough that I needed to make sure you understood what's riding on your discretion."
 I finished with the first third of the bottle, and then nodded.
 "I won't say anything.
 What exactly are we going to see?"
 "Not a what, but a who."
 Much like he'd done when we'd been fleeing from my house, Alec picked me up and then slung me around so I could wrap my legs around his waist, and my arms around his neck and chest.

Having him touch me in other ways was pretty high on the list too, but maybe that was just psychosomatic.
 He didn't need to know that.
 I really did want to spend time with him.
 Even if he wasn't going to touch me, being with him was better than being anywhere else.
 "This is a mistake.
 The worst kind of mistake because we both know it's wrong and we don't care."
 "I don't think it's a mistake.
 I don't even think it is wrong."
 "But if you did, would you care?"
 "Probably not, but that doesn't change the fact that this is what I want to do."

 "How soon will we know if it's really bad or just a little bad?"

 That's probably where Alec is right now actually.
 Brandon's people are always skirting around the edge of our territory, but tonight they'll be out in greater numbers than normal.
 If things don't boil over now, it's pretty much guaranteed that there will be some kind of confrontation Monday at school."
 The word confrontation reached out and grabbed me.
 It took a second before I realized it was dragging up memories of the near-fight between Alec and half his pack.

A mere tinkering with or modest amendment to the structure of the UN will only perpetuate the inherent inadequacies of the present system and postpone its maturation into a truly effective instrument for global political, economic and social integration and collective accomplishment.
 Many proposals are being floated to modify its workings, mostly by expanding representation on the Security Council.
 As an interim measure and first steps, the immediate addition of five more permanent members to the Security Council, based on the criteria of population and economic status, and the abolition of the veto power are fully justified.
 However, these changes do not go far enough in furthering the interests of global peace and development.
 They will not fundamentally alter the out-dated, non-representative structure which perpetuates the status quo.
 It is time to devise a new formula and a new structure for international governance that will reconcile and harmonize the political rights and economic interests of all the world‚Äôs peoples.
 The institution that had come to symbolize the Cold War must be restructured in such a manner as to symbolize the abolition of all war and the establishment of peace and democracy as the foundations for global development.

Alec drew the blinds, which didn't do anything to muffle the principal's raised voice.
 Fifteen minutes later, after the unmistakable feeling of Alec's power had crested to the point where it almost felt like there was a breeze blowing from the office, we were all sitting down with the bewildered school counselor and playing musical classes.
 Only it turned out Rachel and I were the only ones not changing our schedules.
 I started to protest being treated differently than everyone else, only to feel my mouth click shut as Rachel shook her head at me.
 It wasn't until Alec was walking me to Biology that I finally got an explanation.
 "You and Rachel are the ones who need the most sleep, ergo you don't change classes."
 "That's crazy."
 I would've stopped.
 You can't really have a good disagreement while you're walking down the hall, but we happened to be holding hands, which he used to keep me moving along.
 And here I'd been so excited back in the councilor's office when he'd taken my hand.

"I'll be done with Dom in just a moment, Jess, then I'll fix your hair while Rachel finishes up with Adri."
 The nickname should have hurt, but somehow it wasn't as bad when the pack used it.
 It was almost like having a new family, one without all of the grief-poisoned memories that popped up every time I really thought about Dad or Cindi.
 Faster than I would've believed possible, we were all in our dresses, and waiting in the living room for the boys to make their appearance.
 Jasmin and Rachel had worked what I was pretty sure was actual magic.
 Even Jessica was nothing less than stunning, and I didn't look as bad as normal.
 Jasmin's backless black dress and shoulder-length gloves had streaks of blue that brought out her eyes, while Dominic's tight, red gown seemed to give her the confidence and poise you'd expect from someone so gorgeous and utterly exotic.
 Jess had opted for a sleeveless silver number that flared out at the bottom so much I wasn't sure how Isaac would be able to walk next to her without stepping on the shimmery material.
 Rachel's mauve dress was probably the most conservative of all, neither over-snug, nor especially low-cut.
 It had seemed entirely out of character considering what she'd purchased for the rest of us, but when I'd asked, she'd just grimaced and said Alec would've made her stay home if she'd chosen anything more daring.

After educating the public about the need for choice and the necessary costs involved, the final selection of the most accept able package should be made by the people themselves through a national referendum.
 2.Establish macro-economic stability: The errors in earlier efforts at adjustment and stabilization have led some to argue for a series of compromise programmes that do not seriously ad dress the imminent dangers of hyperinflation and economic collapse.
 No transition strategy can be successful without first creating stable conditions for economic growth.
 No effort to improve agricultural production or the availability of food will be successful so long as the currency is not accepted as a stable means of exchange.
 This is the ultimate justification for the insistence of the international lending community on harsh measures to stabilize the economy.
 If the previous stabilization programmes have not proved politically viable, socially acceptable or economically effective, alternative programmes similar to the Yugoslav strategy must be attempted without further delay, backed by the full commitment of government.
 In some cases, it may be necessary to temporarily reintroduce controls on wages and prices as an interim measure to stop the free fall of the currency.
 But whatever the method, it is essential that this effort be combined with simultaneous implementation of other essential policies.
 3.Eliminate crop losses: In Russia and the other republics of the former USSR, highest priority in agriculture must be given to efforts that will increase the availability of food and reduce the huge crop losses and massive food imports.
 These losses vary by crop and region but average between 25 and 50 per cent of total field production for major crops.

In 1990, 948 million people or about 20 per cent of the entire world population lacked even basic literacy skills.
 Adult literacy rates in the least developed nations still average less than 50 per cent and are less than half that in a number of countries.
 Unless more intensive efforts are made, worldwide the absolute number of the illiterate will decline only marginally by the year 2000.
 Illiteracy is likely to increase by 10 per cent in South Asia ‚Äì home to more than 40 per cent of the world‚Äôs illiterate ‚Äì and by nearly 7 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa.
 Although universal primary education has been a goal for decades and primary education has been made compulsory in most countries, 128 million children living in remote rural areas, urban slums and refugee camps ‚Äì representing 20 per cent of the total school-age population ‚Äì are still excluded from primary education.
 Unless greater measures are introduced, this number may rise to more than 160 million by the turn of the century.
 Achieving true universality of primary education by the year 2000 will require a massive investment in school buildings, teachers and instructional materials for an additional 230 million school-age children.
 An additional 4 million teachers will be required, 20 per cent more than in 1990.
 In sub-Saharan Africa, gross primary enrolment will have to double before year 2000 to achieve this goal.
 In addition to the quantitative deficiency in educational enrolment and achievements, the quality of teaching facilities, materials and staff is severely deficient in many countries.

He paced the short distance down to the back row of seats with such incredible grace that I felt my mouth go dry.
 No one person should be so attractive, not when there wasn't enough of him to go around to every single woman in the world.
 For a few seconds I forgot all about the reasons I didn't like him, and just wished he was sitting in front of me instead of two rows behind me where I couldn't see him.
 Then I realized what his arrival really meant.
 Rachel had stood me up.
 She wasn't on the bus, and she apparently hadn't come with her brother, so she wasn't coming.
 I knew I should reserve judgment until I'd given her a chance to explain what'd happened, but it was hard to remember that when faced with Alec's air of superiority.
 Rachel was nicer, but she was still a Graves.
 Maybe this was just a sign of things to come.
 Apparently I wasn't the only one put off by Alec's snobbishness.

 When I was given the shots fired and weapon instructions, I realized that desperate druggies rob guys like me.
 The officer began to explain what I was to do if this turned out to be a robbery.
 Apparently, this Steve was known to carry a weapon and he was known to come up a little short on cash for drug deals and if the seller wasn‚Äôt willing to accept the lower amount, he might brandish his weapon.

Rodregas thought about the attacker and realized that here was one that would be a challenge.
 Judging by the distance his attacker kept and how he was clearly keeping his center of gravity low and balanced, Rodregas knew this opponent was a challenge.
 He was not just bigger and stronger; clearly he knew how to fight.
 A good fighter, of course, knows you do not let an opponent recover.
 His attacker came in hard and fast.
 Rodregas never saw the blow to his face, but luckily it was not a direct hit as Rodregas was already moving in close.
 Before the attacker could deliver another blow he was inside his opponents swing.
 Getting close is not always the best strategy on a powerful larger opponent.
 His attacker‚Äôs large hand reached for his face.
 Rodregas turned into his weight and tried to use his momentum to drive the large body off balance.

I contemplated jotting down a note before just shrugging and skipping outside, happy for once to be shivering.
 It wouldn't last.
 Eventually the sun would clear the hills, and we'd be headed for eighty-plus degrees, but I could at least enjoy the next hour or so without worrying I was going to melt right out of my clothes.
 Walking down the lane, I tried to decide whether or not I wanted Brandon to show up today.
 After my mixed signals yesterday I figured there was a better than even chance he'd 'forget' to come get me.
 Strangely enough that didn't bother me as much as I thought it would.
 It was like walking down the lane managed to put things back in perspective for me.
 How could I be put out about something I hadn't ever actually believed was possible?
 I almost refused to believe my eyes when I came around the bend in our lane and saw a black Mustang parked on the side of the road.
 Brandon stood up from where he'd been leaning against the sports car and flashed me a blinding smile.

Not surprisingly, today all of the high-income industrial nations, as well as the top 25 ranked nations on UNDP‚Äôs Human Development Index, are liberal democracies.
 In contrast, only eight of the 43 poorest nations have multi-party democratic political systems.
 Even among the poorest countries, democracy has served to protect the population from the worst scourges of war and poverty that have ravaged many authoritarian countries.
 Economist Amartya Sen was one of the earliest to observe that no country with a democratic government and a free press has suffered from famine during the last four decades.
 India, the world‚Äôs most populous democracy, suffered its last major famine prior to independence in 1943.
 Although a major famine threatened ten million lives in India during the mid-1960s, it was averted by the government‚Äôs emergency measures and timely launching of the Green Revolution.
 In contrast, as many as 30 million persons may have died of famine in China during the late 1950s.
 The political necessity of maintaining popular support and the threat of exposure by the media force elected governments to take all necessary steps to ensure sufficient food supplies.
 Modern democracy is the political counterpart of the market economic system.
 Historically, democracy broke the monopoly of the aristocracy over governance of the people, giving freedom and rights to the individual politically.

 ‚ÄúAny more questions or can we begin?‚Äù ‚ÄúFine.
 What sort of weapon did you have in mind?‚Äù Her smile widened.
 Her hand stretched out to the side and a long, silver sword came from the pile of gear to land in her palm.
 She righted it, twisting the blade for me to see.
 My stomach dropped.
 ‚ÄúThere are a few things you need to remember when using a blade,‚Äù she instructed.
 ‚ÄúFirst of all, always go for the fatal attack.

"How do I look?"
 she asked Rick when she joined him downstairs.
 "Beautiful."
 She was even darker than she'd been yesterday when she'd tried on the dress, and the contrast the dress made with her hair and skin was striking.
 "I can see where you two have been," Teri said when they arrived at her townhouse.
 "Yeah.
 Doesn't Marie's tan look great?"
 "Yeah--I wish I tanned that prettily."
 As she'd promised when she'd invited them, Teri had made a Chinese meal.
 "House rules: you have to spend at least 15 minutes using chopsticks," she told them as they sat down to dinner.

Peace is imperative for a thriving democracy.
 A comprehensive perspective and integrated approach to these inter-related issues can lead to a major breakthrough on multiple fronts.
 We are poised at what can become a turning point in the role of war in human affairs.
 The momentous consequences at stake call for decisive action.
 Historically, war has been a means of territorial expansion and economic conquest that strengthened and enriched the conqueror while draining the energy and diminishing the wealth of the conquered.
 War and economic development co-existed and sometimes complemented each other.
 Technological progress increased defensive and offensive capabilities.
 The demands of war and the associated destruction stimulated greater economic activity and spurred organizational innovation, especially for the benefit of those not directly engaged in the conflict.
 Guns were one of the first products of mass production.
 In the modern era, society has become the principle target and victim of war.

It was obvious he saw my anxiety, but I couldn‚Äôt be sure he wasn‚Äôt enjoying it.
 He just remained sitting there.
 ‚ÄúWhat should I do?‚Äù A sly grin crossed his face and he rolled his hand out in front of him.
 ‚ÄúYou are only limited by your imagination, Freya.‚Äù Great, so if I screwed up it was just a problem with my mind.
 I considered that, recalling what Steed had said about feeling it, thinking about what you wanted to happen.
 But what did I want to happen?
 I had to catch that line of thought before it spiraled out of control; I concentrated on finding something small.

She was reclined, her bare legs showing where the material of her skirt was pulled to the side.
 When I looked up, she resituated herself, leaning toward Steed and talking low about some nonsense.
 She walked her fingers up his chest as she talked, glancing at me for a reaction.
 She was trying to make me jealous.
 I was suddenly furious.
 She‚Äôd poisoned me and now this.
 I wanted to burn her right then and there.
 I caught Chevelle‚Äôs expression as I glared at her.
 He had seen what she was doing, knew her motives most likely, but I could tell he thought it had worked.
 He thought I was jealous.

 I was fixated on it, my mind spinning, convinced that if I were as invisible as everyone thought, if they truly couldn‚Äôt see me, at least I could get closer and finally know.
 As I shook my head at the idea, my eyes fell downward.
 A small scream escaped.
 My arms were covered in tree bark, blending seamlessly with the stump on which I sat.

As a result, business process outsourcing has become one of the fastest growing sectors of the world economy.
 As growth of the labour force slows in high-income countries, there will be increasing pressure for export of service jobs.
 Public concern in the West over the rapid growth of outsourcing is fuelled by the common misconception that employment is a zero sum game.
 A recent authoritative study of the impact of IT outsourcing found that the direct gains to the US economy in the form of additional jobs in other fields, higher real wages, higher real GDP growth, contained inflation and expanded exports far outweigh the losses.
 While global IT software and service outsourcing displaces some IT workers, total employment increases as the benefits ripple through the economy.
 The net additional number of jobs in the USA added as a result of outsourcing is projected to exceed 300,000 by 2008.
 They will be generated across all sectors of the economy, most especially in construction, transportation and utilities, education and health services, wholesale trade, and financial services.
 Employment is not a zero sum game.
 Computerization: The exciting growth of ICT-based service exports by no means exhausts the potential contribution of computers to growth of employment opportunities.
 Computerization is not merely a field or sector of commercial activity.

Discussing UFOs, Illuminati, and X-Files had been like air and water for some of the people I'd known back in Minneapolis.
 I'd never given their wild theories a second thought before, but what Britney was describing sounded like a pretty convincing attempt at a cover-up.
 I looked up as I realized Britney had fallen silent, only to realize with a start that a pair of tears were trickling down her face.
 "Mark and Lessi were the only ones to really open up when I moved in.
 Their great-grandparents were some of the first people to settle down here.
 They used to tell me all kinds of crazy stories.
 After they were killed nobody would really talk to me.
 Everyone was polite, but it was like I was shut out, like they blamed me for what happened."
 Britney paused for a second and then shuddered.
 "I was supposed to have been with them."

The unconscionable loss of lives due to hunger in an age of plenty generated growing concern over the issues of food and famine.
 Starvation forced millions of people, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, to flee their homes in despair.
 It undermined social stability, fuelled violence and in some cases led to war between neighbours and fellow-countrymen.
 The effort to glean more food from desiccated earth further ravaged the environment and aggravated shortages.
 To this was added the galling sight of hunger amidst plenty, when adequate food production was not matched by sufficient job opportunities to provide incomes to all who needed to buy food because they could not grow their own.
 These concerns motivated and were symbolized by the institution of the World Food Prize in 1987.
 It was in this context that, on World Food Day in October 1988, a small group met in Washington DC and proposed the launching of a new initiative to utilize the growing consensus over food to press for more rapid and substantial progress on peace, disarmament and development.
 Without peace there could be no stable basis or fertile soil for development, without development there could be no lasting and assured peace.
 The inextricable linkage between war and famine, economic dislocation and unemployment, violence and social in stability, fleeing refugees and migrating populations, high military spending and growing indebtedness argued compellingly against any uni-dimensional approach to resolving the problems of peace and development.
 In the rapprochement between the superpowers we saw an opportunity that demanded new perspectives, new attitudes and new approaches.

"So you're saying that I was, am, so broken I glow so your people would be able to pull me aside and fix me."
 His nod was hesitant, but my wan smile seemed to reassure him somewhat.
 "I guess that makes sense.

 Not when I still collapse at the mere mention of what I've lost."
 The silence wasn't as comfortable now.
 I had to break it, even if it meant further examining all of the holes inside me that I'd spent so many months struggling to ignore.
 "So you're just one of those guys that can't resist trying to help the broken girls, huh?"
 "No.

 Seth looked over his shoulder, his eyes twinkling in amusement.

 I remembered being trapped underwater just before waking, but I hadn‚Äôt been drowning.

 I was horrified as more of the memory returned.
 The cloaks who had surrounded my mother, killed her, had been circling me.

 "Of course I knew.

 I've never led her on, but I've always been aware she liked me."
 There didn't seem to be much else to be said, so I thanked Brandon again for the ride into school, and headed off to my home room.

She was beginning to think she didn't understand her betrothed at all.
 She'd never seen him get angry before he‚Äôd proposed.
 And she'd thought that being betrothed would mean they'd spend more time together, but they were actually spending less time together.
 He had dinner with her family two or three times a week, but he and her father always retired to her father's study for the rest of the evening.
 And they'd only gone out alone twice.
 Considering the pattern of the past five weeks, Marie was thrilled when Davis told her that he was taking her out to dinner the next Friday evening.
 But it turned out to be completely unlike the night of their betrothal.
 Davis was in an abominable mood, complaining about the food, the service, even the color of the tablecloth.
 And he was too tired to go dancing after dinner.
 "Can we at least go for a walk by the river?"

The officers are un-amused.
 The officers are sent to stake out a nearby drugstore.
 My story to the drug dealers will be that I will fill the prescription there and meet her in that parking lot as it is a stone‚Äôs throw within the county line which they want the bust in.
 One problem I point out is that the drugstore will be closed in a few minutes but they send the crew that direction for feedback on the location.
 The call comes back and the parking lot is virtually empty of cars leaving no cover for the officers to hide.
 I am starting to feel like I know more about this drug busting business than the cops.
 After a change of venue to a nearby grocery store down the street and several miles within the county line, it is nearly 9 pm and I have been unable to call my wife for over three hours.
 The officers move into place for the bust.
 Several marked police cars hide in an adjacent apartment complex that has a driveway into the grocery store parking lot at the opposite end of the shopping center.
 I am instructed to park my truck‚Äôs front end against a fence that borders the parking lot facing the greenbelt.

 The elf glared, detonating the attack with a thought.
 Molten rock covered the street, splattering across both Velixar‚Äôs and Aurelia‚Äôs shields before sliding to the dirt.

 He took out a bag of bones and scattered more than thirty pieces.
 ‚ÄúHow long before you break?‚Äù

 The elf dropped to one knee, words of magic streaming out her mouth as fast as she could speak them.
 Her magical shield could halt attacks of pure magical essence, such as the conjured fire, but animated objects were a different matter.

Everyone in the club was Italian, except one fellow.

 To them, my traveling wardrobe marked me as a hick and slob.
 So when I arrived in my jeans and flannel shirt at a party to which they hadn‚Äôt invited girls yet they still dressed in alligator shoes and polished chino slacks, at least a few of them took offense.
 The Polish fellow began goading me, first about my clothes, then about the beard I had grown, then about what losers were all us from California.
 I attempted patience, since I was their guest and because I remembered Tony‚Äôs stories that placed him in the low range of this crowd‚Äôs toughness.
 But at last I mouthed a comeback.

That first acceptance by the group opened the floodgates and Buddy Gardner became something of a songwriting machine.
 Other artists recorded many of his best things, a blessing, and he became a regular at Hi Studios, at Sun and later at Ardent.
 He was covered by many of the Mid-South‚Äôs biggest stars.
 And later by some of the country‚Äôs:  Elvis Costello did ‚ÄúLemmy Caution‚Äôs Incubus.‚Äù  Van Morrison made ‚ÄúBlues for Sid and Shirley‚Äù a staple of his live performances.
 Led Zeppelin, for God‚Äôs sake, did ‚ÄúProcap√© All Night,‚Äù Jimmy Page being an early fan, as is written.
 Just for the record Buddy wrote these hits for other stars:  ‚ÄúButtermilk Thighs,‚Äù ‚ÄúBlues for Sandra Leathers,‚Äù ‚ÄúWrong for the Right of Way,‚Äù ‚ÄúArcade Late-Night Blues,‚Äù ‚ÄúOpen Channel D,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Sins of Monk Cassava,‚Äù ‚ÄúThey Bribe the Lazy Quadling,‚Äù ‚ÄúPatience Hell, I‚Äôm Gonna Kill Something,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Nice and the Good,‚Äù ‚ÄúStrawberry Fields for Only a Little While,‚Äù ‚ÄúTake me for Granted, Please,‚Äù ‚ÄúSurfing the Big Muddy,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Rules for Hide and Seek,‚Äù ‚ÄúYoung Avenue Blues,‚Äù ‚ÄúPicnic in Overton Park,‚Äù ‚ÄúChin-Chin in Eden,‚Äù ‚ÄúTurn on Your Love Lights but Turn that Damn Stereo Down,‚Äù and on and on.
 Buddy and the boys were off and running.
 Soon they were one of the most sought after acts, playing gigs everywhere the area offered, in clubs, at outdoor festivals (happenings), and, of course, their famous half-aborted rooftop gig on top of the Sterick Building downtown.
 Officer Mike ‚ÄúMooncalf‚Äù Milton, one of the arresting officers, recalls to this day how polite Buddy and the band were as they were being ushered into police cars while the mob roared.
 ‚ÄúBuddy Gardner was a gentleman in a jerk business,‚Äù Officer Milton remembers.

The two dug through dressers upstairs, grabbing old and expensive robes and shirts.
 They then dragged the body outside to where the deceased elf had kept a private garden.
 Thick brick walls guarded against any prying eyes.
 They dug a large hole in a corner and then bled the body dry, letting the fluids soak into the dirt.
 Occasionally, they would halt and listen, worried their violent struggle had reached unwanted ears.
 No curious investigators arrived, however, and they continued with their dark deed.
 When the blood dripping from the elf‚Äôs wounds became but a trickle, they filled the hole and moved on.
 Using the clothes and robes from upstairs, the two brothers wiped away as much of Ahrqur‚Äôs blood as they could.
 They tossed the bloody clothes, the table, and the pieces of glass they into the fireplace and burned them.
 Harruq wrapped the body in spare blankets he found in a closet.

Part of the reason she felt like she could be gone so much ever since the accident was the fact that I always did the responsible thing.

 With a quick movement of his arms and the haunting memory of the sounds of crunching and popping from all those years ago, he twisted Korin‚Äôs head nearly all the way around.

 He reached down and took the purse off his belt.
 Rodregas opened it to find only a few silvers.
 He knew Korin should have more.

 No--VCR, she corrected herself.
 She got so involved in the exercises and then exploring the house that she'd only watched one of the movies--"Gone with the Wind," which made her laugh sometimes and cry sometimes and held her spellbound the entire time--by 5:30, when Rick got home from work.
 ‚ÄúWould you like me to get you some more movies for tomorrow?‚Äù Rick asked Marie as they prepared dinner together.
 ‚ÄúI still have that other one to watch.
 ‚ÄòCasablanca.‚Äô‚Äù  She handed him the green peppers she‚Äôd just chopped.
 ‚ÄúWhat next?‚Äù ‚ÄúMushrooms.‚Äù  He handed her a carton.
 Rick added some seasonings to the sauce he was stirring.
 Glancing at Marie, he saw that she had a mushroom on the cutting board but was just staring at it.

 Pain shot through my side.
 We rolled over and I fell on top of Seth and then we both landed on Jason.
 Emily landed on us and we all tumbled onto hard ground.
 I didn‚Äôt move.
 Instead I stared at the sky trying to understand how I wasn‚Äôt dead.
 I just was hurting all over and my back felt like I was run over by a car.
 I sat up and my back cried out in protest.

He removed his bow and ran across the grass.
 Velixar had not moved since the brothers‚Äô departure, his hands resting on the grass, palms upward.
 His hood fell far past his eyes, blocking nearly all of his face.
 Yet even with lack of sight and sound from Dieredon‚Äôs approach, the man knew someone neared.
 ‚ÄúGreetings Scoutmaster,‚Äù Velixar said, his deep voice rumbling.
 ‚ÄúI would call you otherwise but I have not been granted your name.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúYou have not earned it,‚Äù Dieredon said.
 He halted directly in front of the motionless man.
 Less than six feet separated them.

Life was supposed to get better as you got older, but it was starting to look like it just got more complicated.
 Just before I looked back down at the shiny aluminum of my now-naked can, Brandon looked up and caught my eye.
 The smile on his face seemed to say all kinds of things.
 I'm sorry I can't come over and talk.
 They all really depend on me.
 This whole thing with Jasmin is really crazy; we've got to figure out how best to handle it.
 Maybe it really said all of those things, or maybe I was completely deluded, but it was definitely a smile.
 That alone was enough to make my heart skip a beat, and send a warm tingly feeling lapping through me like a wave of distilled happiness.
 I was halfway through History before I realized there'd been something odd about the discussion at Brandon's table.

For a moment I thought about what would happen if I fell and hurt myself.
 By the time Mom realized I was missing, I'd be a perfectly preserved mummy, sucked completely dry by the harsh climate, exactly as ordered for a pyramid burial.
 I hadn't realized some part of me was hoping Mom would be there waiting when I got home.
 I felt it shrink as I came around the corner and saw the empty cement pad.
 I walked through the door and dropped my things on the couch.
 I could feel myself sinking back into oblivion, but instead of welcoming it, I was suddenly terrified.
 I'd spent weeks numb to the entire world.
 I'd even missed Dad's favorite season, the one that'd become mine as well.
 It'd be all too easy to slip into the same kind of numbness now as a refuge against everything.
 What would happen if I failed to surface?

 "No.
 But it isn't enclosed.

 But she was fascinated, not scared.

 She enjoyed it so much that they got back in line and rode again.
 But as much as she enjoyed the "E.T."

 That was really like flying--even more than in the airplane.

The north end of the valley was a terraced masterpiece that was remarkably green despite the complete lack of visible water.
 Large trees of a type I didn't recognize towered on each side, shooting up dozens of feet before branching out into an interlocking canopy that cut the harsh sunlight down to a greenish haze that swayed with the gentle motion of a breeze too slight for me to feel.
 A gravel pathway cut its winding way between real, live grass before terminating in a sandy courtyard that my eyes had been avoiding, almost as though my mind wasn't ready to deal with what it knew it would see there.
 The pack had turned at our appearance and six sets of unblinking, inhuman eyes stared up at me.
 A low growl sounded from one of the throats, and Donovan edged in front of me as the largest of the figures turned and struck out at another of the shape shifters with blurring speed.
 A startled yelp bounced off of the valley walls, and then Donovan relaxed slightly and started forward.
 "We should be safe now.
 Master Alec seems to have things well in hand."
 His word choice didn't inspire an overabundance of confidence, but I could hardly turn and run away after begging to be allowed to come watch.
 The path seemed to shrink as we were walking, and almost too quickly sand replaced the crunch of gravel under our feet.

We were not just in a new town, but in a whole new world.
 Thomas and I stuck together, were confidants and support for one another.
 We were getting older and wiser so we were more aware of what was going on around us.
 Our stepfather Dino turned out to be a mystery man with a past that didn‚Äôt add up and a temper that escalated with every drink he poured down his throat.
 He had a painted on smile that couldn‚Äôt be trusted.
 It was the same smile every time and it was anything but genuine and it could turn to angry gritted teeth in a moment.
 He was terrifyingly loud and strong, and we were not accustomed to being told what to do by a man.
 We did our best to stay out of his way, particularly when he was drinking, but he would always find us.
 My brother Thomas and I had become very good at yard work and chores as we learned to perform them with perfection or pay the price of Dino‚Äôs disappointment.
 Every weekend was filled with hours upon hours of yard work at Dino‚Äôs command.

 Brandon reached into the tall, glass-fronted fridge next to the cashier while he was talking, and pulled out a bottle of water and one of those aggressively-colored energy drinks.

 "Um, yeah.

 He handed me the bottle of water.

 The half-orc bowed and then joined his brother.
 The two journeyed across the hills and then snuck inside Woodhaven.
 When they reached their home, Harruq removed his armor and began wrapping strips of old cloth around his wounds.
 Qurrah watched him for a moment before speaking.
 ‚ÄúYou know what you must do, should it come to it,‚Äù he said.
 Harruq nodded, knowing exactly what he meant.
 ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt have much of a choice, do I?‚Äù
 He wrapped a long piece of cloth around his chest and then struggled to make his beefy hands tie a firm knot behind his back.
 Qurrah crossed the room, silent.

But the sinful heart can‚Äôt find happiness.
 And God, he assured us, wants his creatures to get happy, which is why Christ said we must be born again, so he could give us new moral natures, new affections, new objectives, and new directions.
 What planted the hook in me was: according to Billy Graham, when you make your decision for Christ, you do it for the sake of the nation and the world.
 Without God, any nation will perish.
 And a nation is only as strong as its people.
 A better world requires better nations of better people.
 Christ can make us into those people.
 Billy Graham had injected some hope into at least one heart often shamed by its selfish and ornery ways.
 When he asked for all who would surrender to come to the altar, I stood and followed the auburn haired babe.

They were excused from class, walked through the desks that lined the classroom, all eyes following them out the door.
 Their parents stood with the principal ready for their arrival at the office.
 As they entered the room it wasn‚Äôt hard to see the anger and disappointment.
 They were from different sides of this small town.
 My father‚Äôs dad was a butcher, his wife a seamstress.
 My mother‚Äôs dad was an oil rig grunt of American-Indian decent, and his wife, a meek submissive homemaker.
 Neither parent thought the other was good enough for their child, let alone the fact that they were both still children.
 Once the reason for the marriage was revealed, their parents accepted it as best as they could.
 My father‚Äôs parents arranged for them to live together in a small home while they finished school and awaited the birth of their baby.
 It was the late fifties and a pregnant teenager was an embarrassment.

Still, if don't write and share these loco thoughts of mine, not as many people will get to know about Eric, and Olga.
 No doubt Don will read my vision of Eric‚Äôs death as sacrifice and consider it a symptom of a narcissistic belief that the world revolves around me.
 The problem I find with such an explanation is, it wouldn‚Äôt answer a single question about why Eric knew all he did.
 So I‚Äôll risk having friends like Don intervene to get me committed.
 Because, even if I only saw a long shot chance that Eric died to rescue me, from death, from perdition, from a wasted life, or from a danger I can‚Äôt imagine, consider what a cold-blooded wretch I would have to be if I failed to give him his due.

 It didn't look so different from Rick's, she decided.
 They didn't have any white roses like he did, nor an electric fountain, but they had red roses and azaleas, just as he did.
 She wished she'd brought back a picture of him.
 But a picture wouldn't help much, she knew.
 She wanted to be in his arms, kiss him, touch him.
 She wanted to lie in his arms as she had their last night together.
 She wanted to make love with him and fall asleep with him and wake up with him.
 Sounds of breakfast preparations brought her out of her reverie, and she realized she'd been crying.
 Wiping her eyes, she went inside.

That‚Äôs just being a coward, to wish for things to stay like they are.
 We ought to get excited about changes.
 You, for instance, you ought to jump at the chance to go to Pepperdine.‚Äù Though I only remember my mom going to church for funerals, or as far as the front door to pick up a free copy of the Christian Science Monitor, her preference for my education was Pepperdine, a Christian college.
 I suppose she hoped I might find guidance there.

 I gasped as I realized what Alec must have suspected for quite some time.
 "You mean that was really him in my dreams?"
 "Indeed.
 That's part of why he was so concerned you might be a powerful Fir'shan posing as a normal human."
 A tiny sound just outside the door preempted my next question.
 Alec carefully maneuvered a pair of huge metal baskets in through the door.
 I felt my eyes go wide as I realized that they were full of hundreds of cans of food.
 I didn't even want to guess at how much weight was in each basket, but as Alec cleared the door it was obvious that the slow speed that he'd been moving at had only been due to him not wanting to hit anything.
 He moved like they weighed no more than a couple of pillows as he crossed the cabin and set them down in front of what must be the food pantry.

 Nobody else seemed to think that was unusual, which freaked me out almost as much as Ben having nearly gone over the stairs.
 At least I didn't have to listen to all of the gossip during lunch.
 Once I'd been able to hobble down the stairs, I'd made my way to Mr. Whethers' room, and I'd spent the entire lunch break studying.
 I hadn't been especially excited at the prospect of spending that long by myself, but the cafeteria was all the way on the other side of the school.
 Limping over there listening to Vincent run his mouth and then coming all the way back here for History wouldn't be worth it.
 History being what it was, I probably heard about as much in that one hour as most everyone else did during the whole rest of the day.
 Mr. Simms seemed especially dense, and pretty much let everyone do whatever they wanted for the entire class.
 In deference to my new dedication to academic excellence, I finished up the reading, and then opened up my Biology book and started trying to get a handle on all of the items I'd thought I understood, but apparently hadn't.
 When the bell rang I limped back to my locker before making my painful way to Physics.

 And it was all true.
 Suddenly, I couldn‚Äôt catch my breath.
 ‚ÄúPlease, Freya, stay calm,‚Äù Ruby pleaded.
 They were circling me, their arms outstretched as if to catch me‚Ä¶ or cage me.
 Black spots floated in my vision.
 My head screamed.
 The sound of metal bands snapping echoed through a scraping, screeching noise inside my head.
 I pressed my palms against my temples.
 I didn‚Äôt know I was going down until my knees hit the hard rock.

These days, with my big kids and Pam off in the world on their own, Zo√´ is my only real treasure.
 Around the time she was born, I often wrote for the San Diego Reader.
 My editor asked me for a story they would call ‚ÄúOld Man, New Baby‚Äù.
 Here is a condensed version: It could be a gender difference, or an individual one.
 All I know is that I never thought much about having kids until I had one.
 Laura, my first wife, wanted kids.
 So when they weren‚Äôt happening, being the agreeable fellow I can be now and then, I got a simple operation and zap.
 The greatest surprise of my life has been the transformation of my heart the day my daughter joined us in the outer world.
 Back up.
 I had been a sensitive, affectionate kid, as kids go, until I hit adolescence and people started dying.

The Orqui mated with Daemons and their offspring became its races noble house, just as the blood of Celestials flowed in the noble houses of Humans and AElves.
 Of course, here in the Eastern Realms true ruler ship was not by the demi-gods of the noble houses anymore but by the Immortalists and their Guild of the Celestial Path.
 Often those of Celestial blood, instead of being rulers, were prey to the Guild for their rituals.
 Rodregas decided it was now or never if he was going to ask Doi‚Äôvan of his past.
 ‚ÄúSo,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwas your mother in a place of strong magic when she was pregnant with you?‚Äù He held his breath, worried that his question might be impolite.
 But Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs smile continued and he nodded, ‚ÄúYes, my mother is a princess of the Orqui clans of the Farisa across the inland sea.
 There the Orqui are torn between following the Celestials and the Daemon Lords of the Infernal Realm.
 My family is of the Orrghirrlida tribe that follows the Celestials.
 Of course, the Daemon Lords love to tempt all those of Celestial blood.
 I was born a bastard from an illicit affair of such a temptation.

 I was sure I was wearing the same irritated look as Chevelle now.

 Her mouth was twisted in a smile, loaded with false honey.
 I noticed her eyes then, looking past the heavy paint they wore, to dark green jewels‚Ä¶ emeralds.
 They were so like those I had just examined in the mirror that I had to look away.

She stopped when he passed out from the pain.
 She turned his head to the side so he wouldn‚Äôt choke on his own blood, a strange gesture of kindness considering what was left of his manhood.
 ‚ÄúGlad to give you something to remember the town by,‚Äù she said.
 After a flirtatious flip of her hair, she started down the street.
 Aurelia froze, her blood as cold as when she had sensed the man in black.
 This time no magic could be blamed, and no sense of death.
 No, it was just the sight of Harruq, dressed in black armor and wielding ancient blades dripping with blood.
 Just the sight of him massacring an elven warrior.
 ‚ÄúOh, Harruq,‚Äù she whispered.
 Then he saw her, and all time stopped.

You are out traveling and adventuring, while most of us Immortalist just sit in our towers.
 I have always thought that our one weakness was our isolation.
 It is hard to know what is exactly happening when we are not out to see it.‚Äù  For a moment, Taiga paused, looking up at the crystal roof overhead in apparent contemplation of the possible implications of their isolated natures.
 After a moment, in which Van‚Äôdret waited patiently, Taiga continued, ‚ÄúYou are one of our best, and yet you are also in the world.
 The tournament draws the powerful and those who wish to be powerful.
 I would simply suggest that you keep your eyes open, and keep your  mind a little more focused both on your journey and at the Cathedral,‚Äù Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs tone almost dismissed his own comment as a simple chatter of no import.
 Accept Van‚Äôdret had been invited to have lunch with one of the most powerful people on the planet to drop the simply suggestion that he should keep his eyes open for something unusual at the Cathedral of the Heavens.
 The rest of the dinner quickly wrapped up, and Van‚Äôdret soon found himself caught up in thought as he journeyed down several floors to the Great Hall that served as the gathering place for the other Immortalist in residence in the city.
 His questing mind was rudely interrupted by a woman stepping to his side and asking him, ‚Äúso did you ask him?‚Äù ‚ÄúAsk him what?‚Äù Van‚Äôdret asked.
 The Immortalist Sorcerer in the form of a tall athletic human female with spectacular long red hair and blue eyes gave Van‚Äôdret a silent glare before responding.

The half- orc pushed him away and got to his feet.
 He glanced around, trying to orientate himself, when he felt a sharp pain stab into his back.
 He spun, his whip lashing out as it burst into flame.
 It wrapped around the man‚Äôs neck, choking out death cries as his flesh seared and smoke filled his lungs.
 The only noise Qurrah heard was the sound of skin blistering and popping in the fire.
 At last the man crumpled, the bloodied shard of glass from the bottle still in his hand.
 ‚ÄúDamn it,‚Äù Qurrah said, wincing as he touched the cut on his back.
 It was wide but not deep.
 Painful too, he noticed as he took a few steps.
 Furious, he turned back to the corpse of the drunken man and smashed a fist against its chest.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just a friend.

 You should accept her invitation.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to.
 I‚Äôd rather be with you.‚Äù She smiled and leaned over to kiss his cheek, but she could no longer concentrate on her book.
 How could it be that a man she‚Äôd known only a week wanted to be with her all the time when she‚Äôd gone four or five days at a time without seeing the man to whom she was betrothed?
 Could it be that Davis‚Äô job was harder than Rick‚Äôs?
 No‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt just that Rick didn‚Äôt spend half the evening at his office.
 He‚Äôd even chosen to be with her rather than with a girl he‚Äôd known longer than he had her, a girl from his own decade.
 Confusing thoughts and feelings kept her from being able to fall asleep quickly that night.
 She'd had so much fun this week, watching pictures and using the microwave oven and wearing blue jeans, but she missed her parents and her brother and Tom and Davis.

 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre big and scary and send little kiddies running when they see you on the street.‚Äù

Gasping, he gripped the edge of the desk and then turned to jerk the drawer open again and grab the papers.
 Nothing had changed.
 Nothing had changed.
 He threw the papers onto the desk and ran downstairs and out into the garden.
 Forcing himself to calm down, he closed his eyes and began to think about 1927.
 He imagined Marie in the dress she'd worn to and from 1927, imagined her in a speakeasy, imagined her listening to the radio in a room without a TV.
 He had a hard time concentrating and remaining calm, but he continued to conjure up the images, trying to fill in details .

"It just seems silly.
 I mean, I'm not really part of the family or anything, so there isn't really a need, is there?"
 Donovan's smile was incredibly gentle as he shook his head in disagreement.
 "You're very much a part of the family, and if I may be so bold, I'm quite delighted by your inclusion.
 I've not seen Mistress Rachel or Master Alec this content in more years than I like to think about.
 For my part, I hope to have the continued pleasure of your company for a very long time."
 I felt myself blushing.
 I hated how easily my face heated up, but a little thing like my imminent death was hardly going to change that.
 "Thanks, Donovan.
 Not just for that either.

I'd starve to death before anyone found me."
 Donovan's laugh was surprisingly relaxed.
 I'd only ever seen him with a serious, if respectful expression.
 Even Rachel's frequent teasing hadn't ever managed to crack his 'working face'.
 "I hardly think that would be the case.
 While you may very well have lost your way, it would have been a small matter for one of the others to track you down.
 You have, if I may say so, a very distinctive smell.
 It reminds me of a type of sage brush that hasn't grown here in quite some time."
 His sigh was more felt than heard, and it put me in mind of mountains, redwoods, and other ancient things.
 "Donovan, can I ask you a question?"

Fourth, radical changes are needed in the content of school curricula at all levels to make education relevant to the real needs of the students and the development of the country.
 The society whose system of education is integrated with the social aspirations of the country will develop most rapidly.
 The system of education prevalent in most developing countries is oriented toward the outer form ‚Äì acquiring a degree or qualifying certificate ‚Äì rather than the inner content of knowledge.
 Educated unemployment is a direct result of a system that fosters obedience and rote learning rather than individual initiative and creative thinking.
 A new system of development education needs to be introduced at all levels to equip the student with an understanding of his/her society, its achievements and potentials, and the opportunities open to each individual to participate in its future growth.
 The index of its success will be the extent to which students of this curriculum seek self-employment rather than salaried jobs.
 Fifth, minimum and average educational levels should be raised in all countries.
 Two centuries ago education was a luxury of the rich and it was simply inconceivable that every member of the population in any country could receive even a minimum level of education.
 Few of the industrial nations fully meet their own present minimum standards for every citizen.
 These minimums are arbitrary, not optimal.

How did that happen?"
 Alec released my waist and spun me out and back in without missing a single step.
 I wished I could be so lucky, only the fact that his arm was like an iron bar allowed me to keep my misstep from resulting in a fall, or possibly a sprained ankle.
 "Donovan has very inflexible standards when it comes to some things.

 In fact, I don't think I'll ever forget the expression on Jasmin's face when he told her she could go clubbing all she wanted after¬†he judged her suitably proficient in real dancing.

 "That's amazing.

One semester, I taught nine classes at four colleges, about 90 hours a week, which left me too weary to write, or so I thought.
 My son Cody and I went to Tae Kwon Do classes twice a week.

 He told us, "Everything begins with the spirit.

Oravue was a good sized city, with paved roads winding up and down the sides of the hill that the town was built on.
 The whole town was dominated by the fortress like Cathedral in the middle of town.
 While the Cathedral was one of the most impressive fortresses in the known world, the town, in contrast was without walls or visible defenses of any kind, unless you counted all the winding stairs and streets that quickly got the three companions lost several times on their way to the Cathedral of the Heavens.
 The Cathedral of the Heavens was located like most powerful places of mystic significance, on a crossroad of two ley lines.
 The huge structure had been built into and around the top of a granite hilltop.
 The walls were hundreds of feet high in most places and constructed of the very sides of the mountain simply carved flat and smooth.
 Because it was built directly on and out of the very bedrock of the Earth, knocking down the fortress walls was not an option for an opposing army.
 Like the stone of the farmhouse, the stone construction of the Cathedral had been enchanted by Nymphs of the Earth.
 It was said that the ley lines were tapped to provide magical protections as great as the physical.
 The Cathedral‚Äôs defenses gave it the reputation as one of the most impenetrable fortress in the Eastern Realms.

 It was the first time I'd been alone with her--you know, without you and my own date--and it took her less than ten minutes to figure out that I'm not exactly the marrying type.

 "What happened?"
 "She turned cool seven or eight minutes into the conversation, finished her drink, said thank you, and left."
 "She knows what she wants.

 That conversation left a bad taste in Rick's mouth, and he arrived at Ted and Lauri's that evening feeling wary.

But a half mile or so later, I came upon a suitable hollow in a low embankment guarded by the curling roots of a sycamore.
 It wasn‚Äôt a bad start, but I gathered some shrubbery to cover the entryway, the bitter stench of its sharp green leaves giving me a little more security‚Äîor at least the feeling of it.
 The sun hadn‚Äôt set when I‚Äôd finished lining the floor with vines, but I went ahead and settled in, sitting so I could see through an opening in the frond-covered entry.
 It was quiet, harder to fight the thoughts that were trying to creep in.
 I began to run songs through my head for distraction, mangling the lyrics and humming through the parts I couldn‚Äôt remember at all.
 My fingers tapped soundlessly into the dirt, until a flicker of movement just outside stopped me.
 I held my breath for what I was sure was impending, and painful, death, and saw it again.
 I released the breath, which was not, in fact, my last.
 A soft white rabbit loped in front of the bushes I‚Äôd posted for a doorway.

The switch from centrally planned to market-oriented economic systems in Eastern Europe cannot be successful until the population has acquired the skills needed to function effectively in the new economic environment.
 Under the communist system, emphasis was placed on education and training in technical subjects with little attention to marketing, organizational, commercial and interpersonal skills, which are essential requirements for functioning in a market economy.
 A detailed inventory should be compiled of the types and levels of skills needed for transition to the market, covering areas such as entrepreneurship, management, national and international marketing, strategic business planning, finance, quality control, product development, production technology, design, and human resource development.
 Intensive training programmes need to be introduced to impart these skills on a massive scale.
 Even in the most advanced industrial nations there is vast scope for upgrading skills to improve productivity and to keep pace with rapid technological development.
 Inadequate skills are a major impediment to the assimilation of new technologies.
 The increasing demands of global competitiveness place pressure on workers in these countries to continuously improve their skills.
 The mismatch between the skills of the workforce and the evolving needs of industry aggravates unemployment.
 Studies of the return on investment from training programmes document the enormous benefits of continuously upgrading the skills of the workforce.
 Private sector investment in training will prove in adequate unless it is encouraged by incentives or complemented by greater public investment in this sector.

I purposefully rode behind him, glad at least to be able to control the horse on my own.

Agenda for a Global Employment Programme
 Employment is a global problem that cannot be fully solved by individual countries in isolation.
 Policy measures at the national level influence trade and investment flows and employment rates in other countries.
 Economic growth and expansion of employment in one country enhance employment opportunities in other countries as well.
 Therefore, co ordination of policies is in the interests of the global community.
 A comprehensive and coordinated international effort is called for to improve the global climate for economic growth and job creation by evolving stable and supportive policies to regulate capital flows, foreign trade, debt, commodity pricing, immigration and labour movements, transfer of technology, investment, military spending and the arms trade.
 We set forth below a broad policy framework to stimulate global job growth with the aim of achieving full employment early in the twenty-first century.
 1.World Employment Programme: Raising incomes and creating jobs in the developing countries is the best way to promote global economic growth and employment generation in the coming decades.
 The World Summit on Social Development should call for a comprehensive World Employment Programme to stimulate more rapid growth in developing countries as an engine for global economic expansion.
 The International Labour Organization has operated a programme for the past two decades, but solution of the employment problem requires an integrated approach that transcends the scope of any single international agency.

 But what if she couldn't?
 She hadn't been able to this morning.
 Swallowing, she looked up at Rick.

Over the past month, she had grown close to the half-orc Harruq Tun, and with that closeness was danger.
 She saw only a goofy young man while Dieredon swore she met with a killer.
 Only one of them could be right, but who?
 Perhaps not, she wondered.
 Perhaps she saw the elf in Harruq while Dieredon saw the orc.
 The kindest man might become a brute when surrounded by other brutes.
 When Harruq was with his brother, or the strange man in black, how then did he behave?
 Could he kill?
 Could he murder?
 She had to know.

I leaned around him to see, placing my hand on his leg as I angled my head past it.
 That broke his stare and he glanced down at me.
 I watched Chevelle, still walking casually toward us, as if there weren‚Äôt two angry panthers preparing to pounce on him.
 But I must have appeared about as threatening as a kitten, because the leg I was gripping shook with laughter.
 My angry gaze turned on my new acquaintance and he raised his hands in surrender, still chuckling.
 ‚ÄúI take it you know him?‚Äù he asked.
 ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs following me,‚Äù I announced, too loud.
 His eyes were concerned, so I let down my guard, moving to stand behind him.
 Chevelle approached us, staring directly at me as if there were not the broad, tall form of the stranger between us.
 He let me see his irritation for one long moment before his features melted back into their standard sternness.

It is true that the UN stands for diversity and pluralism, but not when it comes to freedom and human rights.
 True pluralism and diversity can only be exercised and enjoyed by people in freedom.
 Recognizing the considerable effort that will be needed to prepare still subject people and to train national leaders in democratic institutions and processes, all possible support should be extended by the international community to make available the knowledge and skills needed to build viable political institutions.
 The UN should establish a graded, time-bound programme for the transformation of authoritarian states.
 Should the people of any country themselves prefer an alternative system, let them freely make that choice by electoral process.
 Suspension of voting rights or of the privileges of membership should be the ultimate penalty for the failure of governments to comply with this condition within a reasonable period of time.
 The affirmation of democratic principles cannot and will not stop with the domestic governance of member countries.
 It is inevitable that the same principles be extended to the relationships between the nations that make up the international community.
 The present structure of the UN system is a product of the Second World War, just as the League of Nations was of the First.
 The Allied powers conceived it at the height of the war and evolved its structure to reflect the immediate post-war realities.

Now the mask was gone and I was immersed in vivid colors, living lights, and a sense of harmony so strong it nearly overwhelmed me.
 It was impossible to say for certain how long I sat looking at the gentle motion of the tree branches, marveling at the way things made up of light could still cast shadows when silhouetted by the harsher light of the sun.
 Only somehow the sun had disappeared, replaced by the paler, colder light of the moon.
 The trees were still graceful strands of light, but the breeze had changed to a harsh thing, one carrying new scents that somehow represented danger.
 Something inside me forced my limbs into motion.
 I was running before the first howl tore through the night.
 I was moving unimaginably fast, jumping fallen trees and bounding over other obstacles which even my improved vision struggled to make out in time for me to avoid them.
 The speed of my passage wrung tears from my eyes, but I didn't dare slow.
 They were back there, four of them moving with speed only slightly less than my own, noses to the ground to follow my scent, save for the moments in which they let loose their unearthly howls.
 A flicker of motion up ahead should have made me pull up in fear, but the smell accompanying it was somehow familiar, somehow safe.

As Eric helped me out, I got more cheers than he had.
 Later he would explain I had made a neat flip while careening into the pool.
 He led me inside, wetted a washcloth and dabbed the wound on my forehead until I faded.
 I awoke on the outskirts of heaven, gazing across a chasm at the enchanted forest.
 The air resonated with music, clean and simple melodies, at once ardent, tender and joyful.
 Maybe it was a dream.
 Or a premonition.
 Or, for all I know, I might have briefly died.
 The spell broke and left me sprawled in the Desert Inn.
 I lay still a while, sore all over, with a throbbing skull, wishing to go back to heaven.

Mighty pleasant work, which we‚Äôre both apparently competent at.
 According to the pre-natal calculations, our little girl--Zo√´ Ada Fox Kuhlken--got conceived during the week after Pam‚Äôs last exam.
 All my adult life, I have worked to support other people.
 I don‚Äôt mind day jobs or sharing what I earn.
 But my day job performance suffers when my mind veers off to the stories I want to get home and write, and I suspect my stories could be richer, more passionate and imaginative, more intuitive and maybe inspired, if they didn‚Äôt always get interrupted by my day job.
 Sure, Franz Kafka was an office worker and William Blake a printer, but Kafka didn‚Äôt live very long and Blake had no kids.
 Anyway, those guys were geniuses.
 Not me.
 So I worried, would the baby help squash my writer‚Äôs dreams.
 People heard I was going to be a father again and asked, "So how old will you be when the baby turns eighteen?"

Chevelle mumbled something but I couldn‚Äôt make it out.
 My ears had begun to buzz, not the all-out siren that had crippled me before, but a constant, crackling hum.
 I worked my jaw, tugged at the lobe of my ear.
 The stranger‚Äôs lips moved, apparently able to speak again, and Anvil approached him, dwarfing the captive with his mass.
 Anvil exhibited remarkable menace when he addressed the frozen councilman, who mouthed another reply.
 Through ringing ears I couldn‚Äôt decipher their words, but somehow I did hear the breaking bones.
 A grotesque crunch accompanied the snapping of the councilman‚Äôs thigh, and he dropped nearly to the ground.
 Anvil leaned over him, somehow even more intimidating as he spoke directly to the man, as if they were the only two here, as if he hadn‚Äôt just suffered a traumatic injury.
 And, evidently, Anvil didn‚Äôt like the answers he received, because the councilman‚Äôs other leg snapped, dropping him to rest on the stumps of his broken, mangled thighs.
 I should have turned at the sight, but I couldn‚Äôt keep from wondering how it was possible he remained upright at all.

When they arrived at the Cathedral eight days later it was late in the afternoon.
 They had to hustle through the town of Oravue to reach it in time to register for the upcoming melee.
 Oravue was a good sized city, with paved roads winding up and down the sides of the hill that the town was built on.
 The whole town was dominated by the fortress like Cathedral in the middle of town.
 While the Cathedral was one of the most impressive fortresses in the known world, the town, in contrast was without walls or visible defenses of any kind, unless you counted all the winding stairs and streets that quickly got the three companions lost several times on their way to the Cathedral of the Heavens.
 The Cathedral of the Heavens was located like most powerful places of mystic significance, on a crossroad of two ley lines.
 The huge structure had been built into and around the top of a granite hilltop.
 The walls were hundreds of feet high in most places and constructed of the very sides of the mountain simply carved flat and smooth.
 Because it was built directly on and out of the very bedrock of the Earth, knocking down the fortress walls was not an option for an opposing army.
 Like the stone of the farmhouse, the stone construction of the Cathedral had been enchanted by Nymphs of the Earth.

Not used to being outclassed academically, I got flustered, which led to a misplaced decimal, and then an incorrect conversion from English to metric.
 Alec just continued on, never seeming to really hurry, never actually making a mistake, but still grinding through calculations with a speed I might have been able to match on a good day, but couldn't even approach today.
 It would've been much easier to just stop my efforts and watch him work, but I was too stubborn to give up.
 Alec finished up with the theoretical portion of the assignment, and started stringing the pulleys while most of the other groups were still arguing over whether or not they could afford to add a few extra grams for extra credit.
 If there was a single person in the class who¬†didn't¬†need any extra credit, it was Alec; but he calmly loaded the system with an extra sixteen grams, caught Mrs. Alexander's eye, and then smoothly started the train of weights moving up the ramp, over the wall, through the woods, and right up to Grandma's house.
 It wasn't fair that someone who missed so many days of school could be so consistently right.
 He must have an IQ of 160.
 That and an ego big enough for someone twice as smart.
 Mrs. Alexander shuffled over and smiled at the pair of us.

As usual, Alec slipped into class a half second before the bell.
 I was so happy I forgot how arrogant he was, and I smiled at him as he sat down.
 It was like he was looking at something that wasn't even human.
 My insides seemed to freeze and shrink.
 I couldn't even muster up my normal blush of embarrassment.
 I'd had plenty of people hate me since I'd arrived in Sanctuary, but he was the first person I'd met who I was convinced wouldn't have thrown me a life preserver if I was drowning.
 It wasn't even because saving me would be too much work.
 He was completely convinced the world would be a better place without me.
 I'd never been so unnerved in my life.
 As Mrs. Alexander took roll and then released us into our groups, I was still trying to pull myself back together.

"The boy's name's Ben.
 I'm not sure why she's fixated on him the way she has, or why she views Lucy as such a deadly threat to her chances with him, but it's essentially that simple."
 I felt like my head should be reeling from the sheer stupidity.
 Even in a town this small, it didn't seem like the competition for the available males should be a matter for death threats.
 Brandon took my head shaking as denial of what he'd said, rather than disbelief regarding the situation.
 "I promise that every word I just told you is true.
 More importantly, I promise I'll make sure nothing terrible happens to you."
 Looking into Brandon's caring eyes, I almost couldn't believe any of it.
 Being threatened and then having the perfect man come to your rescue didn't happen in real life.
 Then again, maybe I was due for some happy endings.

 His heart pounded as he ran toward the waves.
 He hoped she had enough sense not to go out very far.

4.Liberalize agricultural and textile exports: Utilize agriculture as an engine of industrialization, international trade and employment generation by reducing the barriers to a major expansion of agricultural production and exports from and between developing countries.
 More than two billion people in developing countries, representing about 35 per cent of the entire world's population, are dependent on agriculture as a primary source of livelihood.
 This compares with 45 million people in industrial countries, which represents less than 1 per cent of the world's population.
 Agriculture is the most heavily protected sector of world trade.
 In 1991 the industrial nations spent more than $180 billion on agricultural subsidies to support their farm populations, which is three times the total world overseas development assistance.
 These subsidies cost Western consumers another $135 billion annually in terms of higher food costs.
 Agricultural protectionism in the North not only places powerful constraints on exports from developing countries, but also directly interfere with the livelihood of one-third of the entire human race living in developing countries.
 The elimination of the system of quotas and subsidies to Western farmers can dramatically reduce the budget deficits of industrial nations and bring down food prices, while stimulating large-scale expansion of agriculture, industrialization and job growth in developing countries.
 Existing trade barriers by the industrial nations to textile exports cost developing countries an estimated $50 billion annually.
 The complete elimination of these barriers could result in a doubling of textile exports by developing countries.

 It was all so surprising that it took me a moment to find my voice.

 "Those of us who don't require normal amounts of sleep have all been up for quite some time, with the exception of Master Alec, who remained abed for an uncharacteristic length of time, but the rest of the house is just now waking.
 In fact I rather suspect you have just enough time to shower and eat before Mistress Rachel will be pounding on the door, as it were, in excitement for your upcoming trip into town."
 A groan escaped me despite my best efforts.

 I guess this was my bottom.
 Moving back to Sacramento would be the first time in many years I would live with my mom, who had recently become a widow.
 She needed my help sorting things out, because she was left with a lot of complex issues after Dino‚Äôs suspicious death.

 He cut into a bush that apparently had a yellow jacket nest in it and they swarmed him and stung him to death.
 Nobody else at the event was stung, but he was stung several hundred times.
 The venom in such a massive dose poisoned him, so the story goes.
 I do believe in Karma (well, I do now!)
 and the world is a better place without this man, but I don‚Äôt know if I believe that story.

It didn't seem fair for things to cool off now when it was so inconvenient after so many weeks of oppressive heat.
 I was still musing over the injustice of it all when Alec shifted me around so I was held in just one arm.
 "There's something I'd like you to have.
 Something I hope will help you remember what you mean to me..." He trailed off, and then seemingly at a loss for words, reached out and lifted the black velvet that'd been covering the painting.
 Another graceful gesture flipped on the set of soft lights surrounding its border.
 As always with Alec's paintings, it took me a second before I could shift my perspective enough to translate the beautiful formations of light into something I could tie to the drab, dreary world I inhabited.
 It was the same grotto where we now stood.
 The warm glow from the climbing ivory and roses formed a backdrop awash in the silvery light of a full moon.
 Just visible off to one side was the pool, alive with enough microscopic life to give it a pale glow of its own to compliment the off-center reflection of a hundred tiny lights.
 A few seconds later I finally recognized that the subject of the piece was a female, reaching out towards the point of view with glowing hands.

 Half the businesses in the town are owned by my family, the other half are owned by Alec's mother."

‚ÄúRuby, is there a way to harness the power of things‚Ä¶ like that waterfall?‚Äù Grey glanced at me.
 The look of concern for my intelligence was not exactly uncommon, but it was something I could never quite get used to.

 She got her mischievous grin then.

 She continued as if excusing herself, ‚ÄúBut it was merely a fairy‚Äôs tale and probably not entirely accurate.‚Äù Then, in a lower voice, ‚ÄúIt is fun to speculate, though.‚Äù I wiped at my cheek to clear the dampness from the mist, mirroring her low tone as I questioned her.
 ‚ÄúHow would you steal life force?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, like I said, probably not accurate‚Ä¶ but you would have to take the other‚Äôs life in order to gain their power.

I guess I've just decided I'm tired of trying to be good when I have so little time left."
 "Why is that selfish?
 Most people would think you were being quite charitable taking the new girl to the big dance when you could have your pick of anyone in the school and half the females in the state."
 Alec slowly reached over and took my hand for the first time since we'd sat down.
 The sudden surge of tingly, pleasant energy nearly distracted me from the fact he was very carefully not meeting my eyes.
 "Can you feel that?
 I mean, it feels good, doesn't it?"
 I felt smiles tug at the corner of my lips as a giggle bubbled in my chest.
 "I think it's supposed to feel good, silly."
 My laughter died at his lack of matching mirth.

It is unrealistic to expect that any system of international controls or inspections can prevent their eventual acquisition by states that decide to develop them and have the advanced scientific capabilities to do so.
 From the inception of nuclear weapons, two things have been clear.
 There can be no victors in a nuclear war and there is no credible defence against these weapons.
 Confidential studies by NATO in the 1960s concluded that the costs of a nuclear exchange to either party would be so great that the weapons were essentially unusable.
 No satisfactory answer has ever emerged for the question: where and under what circumstances can these weapons be deployed beneficially?
 The continued expansion of nuclear stockpiles over three decades may have added to the self-importance of the military and political leaderships, and perhaps of the general public, in states that possessed them, but there is little evidence that it ever added to national security.
 The unusability of these weapons helps to explain why predictions of rapid spread of these weapons to other states proved to be so wildly exaggerated.
 The irrelevance or unusability of nuclear weapons is evident in all the wars involving major powers during the past four decades.
 A greater understanding of the environmental impact of these weapons has further strengthened the perception of unusability.
 It is time that psychological posturing gave way to a mature recognition that these weapons have no place in the civilized world and must be banished from it.

Chairs are scattering as they tip over and who knows what those two men in the helicopter are going to do?
 I look up and the only man standing is Grandpa who has his arms in the air as the wind from the copter pounds him and ripples his suit like a flag in the wind.
 This deeply religious (and senile) old man proclaims loudly ‚Äúthe lord has come to take my son!‚Äù and he continues to repeat this line as if he is a TV preacher in a revival tent.
 I have an eye on the copter and a hand on Grandpa‚Äôs leg as I attempt to pull him to the ground with the rest of us.
 People are barely audible but they are screaming and crying and in total panic.
 The men reach inside the helicopter and they hold what appear to be large boxes.
 They turn the boxes over in all this mayhem; something dumps out in large clumps banging down on the top of the cars and limos they hover over.
 The loud bangs cause those who aren‚Äôt looking to think they are explosions or gunfire.
 A closer look at these clumps reveals that they are flowers!
 In a misguided effort to sprinkle flowers over the gravesite ceremony, they have terrified everyone (except Grandpa).

Whoever his assailants were, they had him trapped.
 Rodregas violently kicked out with one leg, but his stabbing attacker avoided the blow.
 He did let up on the knife for a second though.
 Instead of following up, Rodregas used the momentum of his kick to swing his body sideways.
 Skilled, close up fighting was all about leverage.
 Instead of resisting the attacker‚Äôs strength Rodregas pushed down on the earth with his hands and lifted his body up and to the side, curling the leg he had kicked out underneath.
 He planted his foot under his body.
 His attackers seemed confused, grabbing him and trying to counter his change of position.
 Rodregas only had one leg under him, but he pushed off with it with all his strength and thrust himself up.
 It should have failed with all the men holding him down, but he now had celestial strength, and even with the knife wound he was strong.

The Graves estate was cradled between two spurs, and we'd finally traversed the length of the estate to arrive where the spurs joined the mountain.
 The north end of the valley was a terraced masterpiece that was remarkably green despite the complete lack of visible water.
 Large trees of a type I didn't recognize towered on each side, shooting up dozens of feet before branching out into an interlocking canopy that cut the harsh sunlight down to a greenish haze that swayed with the gentle motion of a breeze too slight for me to feel.
 A gravel pathway cut its winding way between real, live grass before terminating in a sandy courtyard that my eyes had been avoiding, almost as though my mind wasn't ready to deal with what it knew it would see there.
 The pack had turned at our appearance and six sets of unblinking, inhuman eyes stared up at me.
 A low growl sounded from one of the throats, and Donovan edged in front of me as the largest of the figures turned and struck out at another of the shape shifters with blurring speed.
 A startled yelp bounced off of the valley walls, and then Donovan relaxed slightly and started forward.
 "We should be safe now.
 Master Alec seems to have things well in hand."
 His word choice didn't inspire an overabundance of confidence, but I could hardly turn and run away after begging to be allowed to come watch.

 He went to search through the refrigerator and the cabinets.

Numerous attempts to let Richard in our lives always ended in disaster.
 I know it is natural to want to know who your father is.
 Unfortunately sometimes he is a complete jerk.
 Richard is just not a good person; actually he is quite the opposite.
 It was difficult for me to discover that my father‚Äôs lifelong friends didn‚Äôt even know he had sons.
 Besides being an alcoholic his whole life, I found out he was a first rate con-man.
 He was a womanizer, with a taste for young girls, and a big time loser.
 When I did try to let him into our lives, he was verbally abusive to me, my wife and even my children.
 The final disaster with Richard followed a family vacation.
 Richard invited himself to join our annual family beach vacation and I allowed it.

His large frame stalked through the grass, eager for the hunt to begin.
 The great Lion twitched his ears to the right.
 He had expected his nemesis, the White Stag, but instead walked a woman.
 Her long legs somehow managed to keep pace with him.
 Her hair, as golden as his own fur, rained down her curved back; she wore a glowing short white shift adorned with many pouches.
 ‚ÄúWhy do you hunt with me, Goddess?‚Äù The Lion growled.
 The Goddess Blodeuwedd answered, ‚ÄúI am proud of you.
 I will be truthful, I shared my favor with you simply as a matter of convenience.
 I hoped you might succeed.
 I did not think you would live, much less add to your power and gather more hunters to our pride.‚Äù The great Lion shook his head, the ways of the winds and the speech of gods were the same, fickle and not to be truly understood.

‚ÄúOld family recipe, you see.
 My mother left a diary.‚Äù She was thoughtful for a moment.
 ‚ÄúAh, what a thing, a mother‚Äôs diary.‚Äù Ruby went silent for too long and I wondered if she would be returning to this one-sided conversation any time soon.
 Her eyes flicked back to me.
 ‚ÄúIt was very fortunate for me she‚Äôd kept a journal, you see, for I would have no fairy knowledge without it.‚Äù I felt my brows draw together and tried to smooth my face.
 ‚ÄúNo, don‚Äôt feel bad for me.
 With you in such a position.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know what she meant exactly, but she continued, ‚ÄúAnd my dear brother has been there for me all along, helping me with the elf parts.‚Äù She kept talking as she leaned forward, seemingly unaware I‚Äôd not spoken a word in response.
 Not that she‚Äôd given me much opportunity.
 I contemplated whether this was her usual behavior toward strangers or if she felt we had a special motherless bond.
 She ran her finger through the substance in the canister and it came out coated in a deep, dark green that had the consistency of grease, which she smeared across the base of my eyelid.

The hands I‚Äôd splayed against the wall of stones for support were now in bonds.
 I forced myself to look away from Ruby‚Äôs back, her arms stretched out defensively, to see what was holding me.
 My breath came then, fierce and gasping.
 Panic.
 Long vines were wrapping tightly around my wrists, reaching out for my legs.
 I burned my right wrist free, fighting to reach my sword before they grew back.
 Large thorns burst from the vines on my legs and pierced my skin like daggers.
 I barely had the capacity to hope they weren‚Äôt poison.
 I sliced at them furiously, but I wasn‚Äôt fast enough.
 Out of the corner of my eye I saw a flash of lightning and it confused me for a moment; no storm was near.

When Dieredon had first come to her, she had expected little difficulty in the task.
 ‚ÄúThey are new to the town, and when they came so did the murders,‚Äù he had said.
 ‚ÄúMeet with one of them, discover who they are.
 If they are the vagrant scum they appear to be, it will be easy enough to catch them in their crime.
 The humans can then deal their judgment with a rope.‚Äù
 It seemed perverse that she had met Harruq by saving him from the fate she was supposed to doom him to.
 Still, Aurelia was not one to judge by appearances, and what she had seen that night had seared her heart.
 Two soldiers beating Harruq bloody without cause or reason, Harruq who was so kind to her when they sparred, who brought her flowers and told her stories, who looked upon her like she was a goddess of light in his dreary world‚Ä¶
 Harruq drew his sword.
 It shook in his hand.

It hadn‚Äôt occurred to me that might be how he killed his prey.
 He made his way back over the scrubby brush, two small rabbits in hand.
 He dropped them and a branch covered in fat, blood-red berries by the fire, and I posted myself on the edge of an uneven rock to watch.
 He didn‚Äôt speak, but I couldn‚Äôt tell if he intended to give me my space or was just indifferent.
 I had, after all, apparently been guilty of the charges.
 I was a criminal.
 I silently wished Steed was here to build me a shelter so I could crawl in and hide until morning.
 I wasn‚Äôt about to try to build one on my own and risk embarrassing myself in front of Chevelle.
 A gust of wind pushed the flames beneath the spit, causing them to writhe and jump.
 They formed shapes that pulled at my memories.

He'd sunk down beside me while he was talking, resting with his hands behind his head so he could look up at the few thinly-stretched clouds.
 I took the opportunity to move closer, cuddling up next to him.
 I didn't bother looking up at the sky.
 Truth be told, I had all the beauty I needed right in front of me.
 His slight start as my head came to rest on his arm was disappointing but entirely predictable.
 He adjusted my blanket slightly so it was between us and then pulled me closer.
 He was perfectly happy to touch me as long as there wasn't any actual skin on skin contact.
 Every time I pushed for more he backed away or found somewhere else he had to be.
 "That must have been rough.
 There are a lot of strong personalities down there."

1.Stabilization and adjustments: The majority of countries, having suffered from inflation and balance of payments problems in the 1980s, applied sharp stabilization and adjustment programmes in the early 1990s to stop inflation, balance budgets, and close balance of payments gaps, while at the same time liberalizing prices in order to correct major price distortions.
 These deflationary policies led, in most cases, to sharp declines in output.
 2.Resource allocation: Sudden dismantling of the central planning machinery responsible for the allocation of materials for current production and allocation of funds and materials for investment in these countries was another shock.
 It proved impossible in the majority of countries to create and organize, overnight, commodity and financial markets of sufficient depth and flexibility to substitute effectively for the planning machinery.
 3.Import liberalization: Drastic import liberalization led to the inflow of better-quality, lower-priced foreign goods that depressed demand for domestically produced goods.
 The shock impact of imports was aggravated by the fact that farmers in the region were forced to compete in some cases with subsidized agricultural products from the West.
 4.Privatization: Although the actual progress of privatization has been relatively slow in most instances, the uncertainty regarding the future status and ownership of enterprises and property has inhibited investment, slowed up current production, and led to widespread plunder of state property.
 5.Trade: As the socialist structure of these countries began to change and the political influence of the Soviet Union diminished, there was a huge drop in the trade between countries of the region, and, following the break-up of the USSR, between the republics of the Soviet Union as well.
 Not all countries in the region experienced all five shocks.
 Those that were spared proved better able to sustain output and real incomes.

Democracy is the most potent fertilizer to ensure food security at the household level.
 ICPF was founded at a time when a consensus was emerging worldwide that drastic steps were needed to wipe out the hunger and famine that were ravaging parts of the developing world and afflicting to a lesser extent poorer sections of the industrial nations.
 Recognizing that the problem of food was inextricably intertwined with the problems of peace, political and social stability, and employment, and that no comprehensive solution to one was possible without substantial progress on the others, it was our hope and intention that this growing consensus on food could be harnessed to accelerate progress on arms control and disarmament.
 Ironically, events have unfolded in the reverse sequence.
 Rapid progress has been made during the intervening years to reduce international tensions, but little has yet been done effectively to address the food issue.
 Now that opportunity is before us and compels us to act, for without significant progress on abolishing hunger from the earth, our efforts at arms control and peace making may come to naught.
 Increasing the availability of food and jobs form essential components of a comprehensive strategy to eradicate hunger, poverty and violence from the world.
 Food Security
 Despite great achievements in the post-war period, we live in a world of persistent hunger amidst plenty.
 Presently, around 800 million people living in 46 countries are malnourished and 40,000 die every day of hunger and hunger-related diseases.

The sight of branches clawing at us as we slipped by them with little more than inches to spare was too much.
 I finally closed my eyes and ducked down as close to Alec's neck as I could get.
 With one less sense distracting me, the rest of them kicked into high gear.
 I could feel every step, including the occasional slide as the rough gravel we were running on wasn't up to bearing our combined weight without slipping.
 The bitter taste of fear along the back of my tongue was surprisingly strong, but even so I found my thoughts dwelling on the sheer pleasure of having my arms wrapped around Alec's rock-hard upper body.
 The high-pitched scream of a performance engine pulled me away from my absurd musings.
 James' blue and white Accord passed us doing the better part of twice the legal speed limit, and then flipped around with the distinctive squeal of overworked tires.
 Alec veered up onto the road as I looked back to find that even as fast as he was running, the Accord was still gaining on us at a prodigious rate.
 As the car pulled even with us, Alec smoothly reached over, pulled the passenger door open, pried me off of his back, and slid me into the front seat without losing even a single step.
 If everything had happened at something approaching normal speed, I probably would've started hyperventilating, but it was all so quick my mind didn't have a chance to fully register what was going on before I was safely ensconced next to James.

I must really repulse him.
 Physics was my own little personal hell for the next forty minutes.
 I absorbed absolutely nothing from the rest of the discussion about calculating mechanical advantage, and when we were finally released into our groups Alec and I didn't even look each other in the eyes.
 I gutted out the last five minutes by pretending I was completely absorbed in a reference book while Alec started running preliminary calculations.
 He was out of his seat and halfway to the door by the time I'd even realized the bell had rung to dismiss us.
 Spanish was both better and worse.
 Better because without Alec sitting six feet away from me I was able to think about something other than him, worse because we had a pop quiz and I barely placed in the A- range despite having spent a fair amount of time on my vocabulary.
 Math was plain and simply burning up too much time.
 Something needed to change because my only hope of going to college was to get a scholarship, or load up on student loans, and I had no desire to graduate sixty thousand dollars in debt and spend the next fifteen years trying to pay it all off.

 I was a prisoner after all.
 Chevelle‚Äôs voice was barely audible as he spoke to his visitor in a formal tone.
 ‚ÄúRuby.‚Äù Ruby?
 Before I could stop myself, I was at the door peering through the frame.
 A tiny crack of light allowed me about three-quarters of Chevelle‚Äôs back and all of his guest.
 Ruby.
 She looked to be a little shorter than me, a little smaller, but seemed larger somehow.
 I thought I knew why.
 Around her petite face, by some means both wicked and charming, was a mane of deep crimson hair flowing in curls.

But trees speak to me.
 Speaking to the One Tree was wonderful; the One Tree is here and not here.
 Somehow it can be reached from here I think is the best way to describe it.
 But there is no sigil to be had.
 The tree ‚Äòspoke‚Äô to me as trees do, and it explained about the ‚ÄòBlessing of the One Tree,‚Äô that is probably why it was here like the greater sigils.‚Äù Imeralda spoke in a conversational tone but also like she was amazed by her own story.
 She continued, ‚ÄúI think for a Nymph the Blessing of the One Tree is like a sigil.
 It directs your magic and focuses it as the Tree of Life wants it, but not by binding it into a shape.
 It heals your spirit and makes you more‚Ä¶, well, more of a Nymph,‚Äù she said, her voice was a tone of sunlight and happiness.
 For reasons Rodregas did not understand he felt great.
 ‚ÄúSo, why do you have to climb up a hundred feet to the end of a branch to get a blessing from a tree?‚Äù Imeralda laughed and then yelled down to Doi‚Äôvan, ‚ÄúTake your boots off and your harness and your weapons and climb up on the top of one of the big roots.

Alec's smile nearly made me cry.
 "You know it might be for the best.
 You need some time to get your bearings again.
 Going cold turkey is generally the best way to kill an addiction."
 We'd been through this more than once since he'd killed Brandon.
 He'd been so sure he was going to die that he'd relaxed his normally rigid rules.
 Since then he'd done everything possible to keep me at arm's length.
 Everything short of sending me away.
 Growing up with the example of his mother was a powerful object lesson regarding what happened to humans that got involved with shape shifters; but given enough time, I'd exploit that tiny piece of him that wanted exactly what I wanted.
 "Unless you're sending me away there's no point in having this conversation.

 "They aren't always completely in control, Adri.
 They try, and some of them are really good.
 Alec is probably the most controlled person I've ever met, and Isaac is so disciplined he's almost immune to the power plays.
 Even so, sometimes it's like they operate on a shorter fuse than the rest of us."

 "Yes please, Brandon can only take me home on Tuesdays and Thursdays."
 It wasn't my imagination; Isaac flinched slightly, and Rachel's smile momentarily turned plastic.

 Isaac recovered with admirable speed, smiling as he gestured us forward.

Within the next decade, the aging of the population is expected to reduce job pressures and even lead to labour shortages in some European countries.
 Job growth has been quite rapid in the developing countries over the last forty years, more than doubling total employment.
 The single most important factor behind rising numbers of unemployed persons and increasing absolute numbers of families below the poverty line in developing countries has been the 2.4-fold expansion of population in the Third World, and more than doubling of the economically active population since 1950, which have resulted in a 4 per cent decline in the overall employment rate.
 Population growth rates continue to fall steadily in most countries, with the exception of Africa, providing an opportu nity for economic growth and job growth to catch up with the population explosion of recent decades.
 Along with rapid quantitative job growth, the global economy has achieved dramatic qualitative gains in the nature of employment.
 During recent decades, there has also been a marked movement away from subsistence level manual occupations, primarily in agriculture, to more skilled and remunerative forms of employment.
 Worldwide, the percentage of the work force engaged in agriculture has fallen by 24 per cent since 1950, from 67 to 51 per cent.
 Unemployment is of growing concern today primarily because population has expanded in recent decades even faster than job creation and because a larger percentage of the population, principally women, seek employment now than at any time in the past.
 The shortages of jobs and the resulting poverty represent the most pressing social problem in the world today.
 But viewed in historical perspective, it is clear that substantial progress has been made during the post-war period, making humanity as a whole more prosperous than at any previous period in recorded history.

Jasmin's complete stillness was an eerie counterpoint to the waves of power still beating at me.
 I somehow knew she was just seconds away from springing when the sound of running footsteps caused all three to turn.
 Alec appeared around the corner, followed by Isaac, just a split second before Brandon sauntered into view from the opposite direction.
 The tingly feeling grew exponentially more powerful with so many more shape shifters present.
 Rubbing my arms did nothing to ward off the feeling that entire colonies of insects were skittering across my skin.
 Mr. Rindell's appearance forestalled what I'd been sure would turn into a full-blown fight.
 He sized up the situation with the canny eye of an educator who'd seen more fights over his career than most gang leaders.
 "Class is about to start, and if every one of you isn't where you're supposed to be before the bell rings, you'll have detention for the next month."
 Vincent's hiss was still almost inaudible.
 "This isn't over."

 I knelt down and smacked him across his good cheek.
 ‚ÄúOw, what was that for?‚Äù he grunted.
 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have enough bruises for your liking?‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs for being a jerk and not telling us you were going to fight Kojas on your own,‚Äù I said angrily.
 ‚ÄúHey in my defense, he found me first.‚Äù I opened my mouth to say something smart, but I hear Emily scream.
 I turned around to see Jason crash into a tree and not move.
 Seth jumped up and grabbed his sword from the ground.

 Kojas turned around and looked like a kid on Christmas morning.
 He raised his sword to block Seth‚Äôs blow.

As the limo drives from location to location for this funeral-a-thon, my little brother Harry is watching a helicopter above us.
 At first, it is a welcome distraction, but the chopper keeps showing up.
 We see it through the limo‚Äôs glass sunroof, then notice it when we are getting in and out of limo.
 The longer this goes on it becomes an obsession for all of us (except Grandpa who is likely about to overdose on little white pills which have the name of an explosive!)
 At the gravesite ceremony, thank goodness, that frickin‚Äô helicopter we have all been obsessing about is not anywhere to be seen.
 Our limo pulls up followed by a stream of limos and cars.
 A large tent is up over the gravesite and rows of chairs for the service.
 The massive flower arrangements, which have somehow followed us from every location, are front and center next to a podium where people will once again speak to what a wonderful father, son, brother, (criminal), blah blah blah Dino was.
 Everyone is seated and the service is ready to begin.
 Once the sermon begins, though, guess what is back?

"Okay, Adri.

 Her grin didn't engender trust, but when I opened my mouth to call her on it, she forestalled me with an upraised hand.
 "I swear.
 We'll go home and leave the dress here."
 The pout came back out for a moment.
 "But, if you're not going to let me buy this for you, I'm going to need to compensate by buying something for Jasmin."
 Rachel flounced off, followed by a frowning Jasmin, leaving Dominic to help me out of the straitjacket I was currently using as a dress.

I tried to see past it, through the flames to Chevelle, and then it was gone.
 He was further back now, raising his right hand so a stream of fire followed it, arcing in my direction.
 I was afraid I wouldn‚Äôt be able to extinguish it before it hit me.
 My feet were frozen in place.
 I could only think of one thing: Fight fire with fire.
 I flung my arm toward the incoming stream of flames and a tongue of fire akin to a dragon‚Äôs shot out and collided with it.
 I was shocked.
 I‚Äôd only used my power to light candles and lanterns.
 I‚Äôd had no idea I could produce such a vicious plume of flames.
 I looked to Chevelle.

If Ravenhurr had already included its magic in his own, then Rodregas would have it now.
 Imeralda though has no connection to the Infernal Realms and therefore is blind to it.‚Äù The three nodded slowly, caught up in the mystery of the hidden chambers.
 Imeralda said, ‚ÄúThe need for a connection to sense the rooms would be true for the knights as well.
 We know that neither Hellborn nor Nymphs are usually allowed in.
 In that case there might actually be another room behind the forth wall that we simply don‚Äôt have a connection to and therefore cannot sense.‚Äù The others nodded.
 Rodregas thought that they were heading along the right path.
 Imeralda asked, ‚ÄúDoes that mean that in this room these are great sigils as well?
 Ones that require Infernal sourced magic to work?
 That kind of makes sense if you can have greater sigils that are the shapes of the Celestial Beasts.
 Why not daemons of the Infernal Realm as well?

I almost choked when warm wine hit my throat.
 He leaned forward to get a better look at me as I lowered the container.
 He looked as if he thought I might spook, otherwise I guessed he had plenty to say hidden beneath that smirk.
 It didn‚Äôt stop him from moving uncomfortably close, though, or eyeing me with what I was certain was the same look I‚Äôd just given my meal.
 I cleared my throat, thinking I‚Äôd made my sense of discomfort clear when he started to move, but he only stood, which brought him even closer.
 Well, parts of him.
 I turned toward the fire, tugging the pack tight against my shoulder as I prepared for a graceful exit.

 Seth started to stand up and signaled me to wait for him.
 He jumped over and ran out into the open.
 He leaned forward and narrowed his eyes, probably trying to see the disappearing bunch.
 He held his hand out, signaling me to wait.
 Then he beckoned me and I stood up.

 His muscles shrank inward, tightening in great, painful shudders.
 Several minutes passed as the horrendous pain tore through his arms, chest, and legs.
 Aurelia held him as he lay sobbing in pain.
 She did her best to comfort him, stroking his hair until all his dark strength drained away.
 Exhaustion came soon after, and for an agonizing time Harruq lay there, mumbling incoherently and waiting for the pain to fade.
 At last, he looked up to Aurelia, his eyes a calm brown, the whites bloodshot.
 ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù he said.
 Sleep took him, and relieved, Aurelia let her own eyes close and her hair drape across his face.

 Her voice actually sounded curious.
 Rodregas said, ‚ÄúYes, we do.

 ‚ÄúPromise to say nothing about this, and also promise that you will use your sigil wisely and that if you have a chance to help us you will do so.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou are creating your own little Shadow Order?‚Äù she asked.

He started to jump up as a humanoid shape appeared out of the trees, until he saw that it was just Imeralda.
 She seemed to be paying less attention now to stealth as she was to speed.
 From Imeralda‚Äôs expression Rodregas knew it was something more dangerous than a trade caravan coming down the road.
 Imeralda squatted down next to them and whispered, ‚ÄúA slave caravan is coming; it‚Äôs small but they have a score of guards.
 We need to back up before they get here.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe have good cover here,‚Äù he whispered back, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs check them out as they pass.

 ‚ÄúThey are traveling with a patrol of Immortal guards.
 I think there are only four, but scout patrols often have a warrior with a minor sigil of enhanced senses.
 He might spot us.‚Äù As she spoke Rodregas noticed that Imeralda had a strange expression on her face, she was scared, but also seemed sad.

I'd planned on remaining in my seat until everyone else left, but Mrs. Tiggs motioned me to her desk while half the class was still filing out the door.
 "It gives me no pleasure to tell you this, but based on your initial test score I think you should prepare yourself for the fact that you're probably going to fail this class.
 I worried this would be the result of your starting so late in the semester and not having any prior Spanish experience.
 Unfortunately, it's now too late for you to switch into another class.
 I'm afraid you'll just have to take the failing grade."
 I stood there woodenly for several seconds, unsure whether or not she was through.
 She finally made a shooing motion and turned back to grading papers.
 Predictably, there were still a half-dozen other kids in the classroom.
 They all turned back to the door and started filing out again, but by tomorrow half the school would know exactly how badly I'd just been humiliated.
 I found myself just outside the tutor lab with no recollection of having stumbled to my locker, or going by Physics to grab the stuff I'd left there.

An arrow without its shooter was never a good sign.
 Emily twirled the arrow in her fingers while Jason paced back and forth.
 Emily had offered to be the one who paced but Jason had waved away her offer and started pacing.
 So all Emily could do was sit there and twirl the arrow in fear because right now it wasn‚Äôt looking good for Jazell and Seth.
 ‚ÄúWhat I don‚Äôt get,‚Äù Jason said, ‚Äúis how the arrow managed to stay in perfect shape when the ground collapsed.
 The arrow should be broken and not sticking out of the ground a few feet away.‚Äù ‚ÄúMaybe she shot it after,‚Äù Emily suggested, because that meant that she was alive.
 Jason rubbed his eyes.
 ‚ÄúI guess that‚Äôs a possibility.
 Jazell and Seth were always too stubborn to die anyway.‚Äù He stopped pacing.
 ‚ÄúBut why would she shoot it up here?‚Äù ‚ÄúMaybe she wanted to show us that she was alive,‚Äù Emily said.

Britney had been mad before, now she looked furious.
 "You just picked sides, and you picked the wrong one."
 Maybe I still wasn't recovered from my ordeal on Friday; I felt like I was missing something obvious.
 Britney apparently agreed, and she wasted no time in letting me know what it was.
 "There are two in-crowds here; Brandon's group, which consists of all of the athletes and cheerleaders, and Alec's group, which is about half the size, and outside of his immediate friends is made up of a few geeks and misfits.
 You were on the border of getting in with Brandon, but just threw all of that away to save Alec's little sister when he's too much of a coward to do it himself."
 I wanted to protest, to explain why everyone should be able to get along, or point out that despite Brandon's obvious appeal, it was his friend who was wrong, but Britney had already turned and stalked off.
 I probably would've spent the next few minutes refining my arguments for the next time we talked, but the last thing Britney had said finally sank in.
 His sister.
 Rachel was Alec's sister, and he hadn't made a move to save her.

She said it clearly expecting him not to have anything.
 Rodregas did, have a bow.
 He had two very nice bows wrapped up in the wagon.
 But, while the short swords he handed them were dangerous, they were common and easy to replace.
 On the other hand, the Black Yew bows were rare and powerful.
 He also thought about the chain mail that he had found in Ravenhurr‚Äôs wardrobe.
 While it was way too small to fit him it would fit Imeralda just fine.
 But to give this woman he barely knew such fine armor and weapons was not something to do casually.
 It made a lot of sense sitting there on the foothills of the Arida Mountains, worrying about Gobelyn and Dire Cat attacks, but they were a great gift; no one had ever given him such a gift.

He stepped in closer and attacked, swinging one sword in a slashing forward swing and following up with a backhanded half slash that flowed into a half block.
 Neither was meant to do anything but feel this opponent out.
 The guard swung to try to meet his sword with his own instead of going after him.
 His sword lacked the shine of the ‚Äútrue silver‚Äù of Mithril.
 Instead it had the cast of blue steel, an enchanted steel / Mithril alloy.
 It was as strong as Mithril, but had more weight to it and held a better edge.
 Rodregas backed up, not wanting to see the results of his sword matched against a blue steel sword, as it would likely result in his short sword becoming shorter.
 Rodregas then stepped forward, he had to be careful though, he was a good foot taller than his opponent.
 The guard‚Äôs long sword gave him better reach.
 Rodregas swung at him and retreated.

It was only a few pages, about a fellow who wants peace and security, so he builds a special house with no windows.
 And he decides not to include a doorway.
 Once it‚Äôs done, he can‚Äôt get out.
 In the morning, Eric read it.
 No doubt he could have told me the theme wasn‚Äôt much different from my dream of going off with Karen to a secluded cabin, or from my quitting the baseball team so I could spend afternoons alone smashing golf balls.
 But Eric rarely gave answers to questions we could solve on our own.
 In that, he was like God, who perhaps respects us more than we deserve.

The water was cooling, so she rapidly bathed, washed her clothes, and stepped out of the tub.
 The bath towel was big and fluffy and felt wonderful against her skin.
 She looked askance at the night shirt, however.
 She'd never worn such a thing.
 When she put it on, she found that it fit her like a tent.
 But oddly enough, she liked it.
 The big bathrobe almost reached her ankles, and she felt quite comfortable as she picked up her dress and wet clothing and went across the hall to the bedroom.
 She found hangers in the closet and hung her clothes there.
 But once she was in bed, the dreamlike feeling dissolved.
 She was far, far away from home, in a strange place, and she didn't know if she'd ever get back.

If the beast felt any excitement or nervousness he was not showing it.
 Which Rodregas admitted was better than the opposite reaction.
 But the horse felt incredibly sluggish compared to his own mount.
 Hopefully, the horses positive qualities would shine in the tournament.
 As Rodregas circled around the courtyard warming up his horse he noticed fewer horses than he expected.
 After Doom Hoof seemed awake he headed over to where Doi‚Äôvan stood.
 For this competition each squire was allowed a servant to provide support, mostly assistance with equipment, especially fresh lances.
 ‚ÄúWhere is everyone?‚Äù he asked Doi‚Äôvan.
 Doi‚Äôvan did not look up from the ground where he was trying to straighten out a shield without doing more damage and said, ‚ÄúI wondered that myself.

 He didn‚Äôt seem offended; he simply took a few steps backward to start his demonstration.

 A thunderous crack and excruciating light flew from both of his outstretched hands, slammed into a tall pine, and snapped the top third of the tree off.

Other nations are reluctant to assume the greater responsibilities that a clearly enunciated doctrine might impose on them.
 All would agree, however, that neither an infinite fragmentation of nation states along ethnic, cultural, religious or linguistic lines, nor a blind indifference to persecution or unconscionable neglect of its own citizens by a state government, can be justified by either reason or lofty legal principles, or be permitted by the human heart and conscience to go unchecked.
 The UN is precluded under article 2(7) of the Charter from intervening in ‚Äòmatters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state‚Äô.
 It must be possible to define objective criteria for identifying instances in which action in apparent disregard of this provision is fully justified.
 The deaths of hundreds of thousands of people in Rwanda and Somalia due to famine, ethnic strife and civil war surely qualify, even if errors in the method of intervention, and lack of public support among nations asked to contribute troops, complicate these precedent-setting initiatives.
 The sovereignty of a nation derives ultimately from the fact that it represents the will of its own people and the right of those people to freedom of action over their own lives and territory.
 National sovereignty is limited on two sides: on the one, by the inalienable human rights of a country‚Äôs citizens and, on the other, by the rights of other member nations of the world community and the citizens they represent.
 In past centuries the sovereignty of nations may have been based on the principle that might is right.
 In our more enlightened age, however, the only acceptable basis for a nation‚Äôs sovereignty is that it expresses the will of its own people, and this condition can only be met under a freely chosen form of government that enables people to express their own free will and determine their own destiny.
 Therefore, the decision of the UN to insist on the operation of democratic processes in member countries is an essential step toward resolving the dilemma of sovereignty.

I'd never really fit in, but this was unbelievable.
 New students could always count on someone to offer to be their friends.
 I'd seen it a dozen times before as people had moved in.
 The really attractive people got drawn into the popular circles, less cool people were offered a place with the punks, the nerds, or at least with the drug users, who didn't care as much what you looked or acted like as long as you were hooked on something illegal.
 I knew I had serious problems, but I didn't think they were obvious to everyone that looked at me.
 English was next, and odds were it would be a nearly exact repeat of Biology, possibly minus the awkward introduction.

 "When I'm missing my family, thinking about seeing them again and thinking how ecstatic they'll be is the only thing that keeps me from complete despair."

Continuous supplies of food are absolutely essential to the welfare of the population.
 Food prices are extremely sensitive to changes in the supply of foodstuffs.
 Even a small increase or decrease in supply can lead to a very wide fluctuation in prices.
 A bumper harvest can depress prices to the point of bankrupting large numbers of farmers.
 A poor harvest can send food prices soaring beyond the purchasing power of large numbers of people.
 Buffer stocks, subsidies and incentives are used to protect agriculture from sharp price fluctuations.
 Al though the principles of free trade argue that countries should produce only those items in which they possess a competitive advantage and procure the rest from overseas, few nations are willing to entrust their food supply entirely or even substantially to foreign parties.
 For decades Japan maintained trade barriers to keep the price of rice at more than six times the international level in order to protect and preserve domestic rice producers; the US government exports subsidized wheat; and the European Community sells subsidized milk powder and butter internationally at prices up to one-third below the domestic level.
 The debate over the legitimate role of government in protection of the agricultural economy is partially a question of timing.
 Market institutions and competitive strengths are normally built up over decades.

 I tried my damndest to embrace each son and his hobbies and desires equally.
 Bryce began to love golf, so we played golf often and eventually joined a country club so he could play as often as he liked.
 In the summer, he would spend entire days at the club, soon becoming a great golfer and playing four years on his high school team.
 He also learned what I call ‚Äúaccidental etiquette‚Äù which was my pet phrase for his learning great manners around adults as he golfed with them.

 Brandon eventually lost his interest in youth sports and had no interest in golf.
 He did, however, love hot rods.

I'd fantasized about kissing even back when I thought boys had cooties.
 I wasn't sure I was any more ready than I'd been out in the parking lot, but I could tell by the way he was moving that he wasn't going to abort this time.
 The tingling was even more intense now as I brought my hand up and cupped the side of his face, and then our lips met.
 It wasn't like I'd imagined.
 His lips were warm, and they had the slightest hint of softness, but there was more urgency and fierceness to the kiss than expected.
 It wasn't as amazing as I'd fantasized, but I was still having a hard time thinking.
 I tried to pull back and catch my breath, but his arms had become steel cables that pulled me in tighter.
 Fear finally overcoming my desire not to look stupid.
 I started to push away from Brandon.
 My efforts seemed futile for several seconds, and then his right arm released me.

 The goals of peace, prosperity and fulfilment for every human being represent formidable challenges ‚Äì intellectual, attitudinal, organizational and technological.
 We cannot hope to reach such lofty achievements if we waste and squander the precious and abundant resources ‚Äì mental, psychological, social and material ‚Äì placed at our disposal.
 A massive reduction in emphasis on weapons production and military establishments, made possible by recent political events and demanded by the pressing unmet needs of people everywhere, represents both a great opportunity and a considerable challenge.
 The opportunity is not only further to reduce the threat of war by reducing the capacity for waging war, but also to redirect and utilize for other purposes the resources now dedicated to war making and prevention.
 The challenge is to do so at a time when rising unemployment and economic stagnation in many countries make further cuts in the size of the military unpopular domestically.
 Since 1990, the total number of military personnel worldwide has declined by two million or about six per cent.
 By 1998, a further decrease of at least two million is anticipated.
 A large proportion of these demobilized people have already joined, or will soon join, the forces of the unemployed.

16.Make income distribution more equitable: The number of jobs available is directly related to patterns of income distribution.
 In Japan and other dynamic Asian economies, the ratio between the bottom and top pay is as much as 5 or 10 times lower than in the United States.
 A highly skewed income distribution results in lower levels of overall demand, growth and job creation.
 Lopsided income distribution fuels speculative investment, more and more of which goes overseas.
 The average wages for production workers in the United States are the lowest they have been since 1967, with 18 per cent of full-time workers not earning enough to keep a family of four out of poverty, up from 12 per cent in 1979.
 Income redistribution in the industrialized countries requires structural adjustments similar to those which the West has advocated for developing countries.
 A 'maximum wage' law can be introduced, requiring firms to pay taxes on exorbitant executive compensation.
 Agenda for a Global Employment Programme
 Employment is a global problem that cannot be fully solved by individual countries in isolation.

 It took several minutes to gather my thoughts enough to know where I was.

She landed hard, unable to brace for the fall.
 The air blasted out of her lungs, and for one agonizing second they refused to draw in another breath.
 Slowly the black magic seeped out of her, the pain faded, and then she sucked the dusty air into her lungs.

By their size, I might have guessed they were wolves, but I‚Äôd never known a wolf to be tamed.
 Their fur matched the robes of their masters, down to the black trim.
 I couldn‚Äôt be certain in the light, but I thought there was even some silver showing.
 Surely they would be less frightening in the light of day.
 Ruby broke the tense atmosphere with a curtsey.
 ‚ÄúAnd Ruby Summit.‚Äù I attempted a smile for her, not missing the silent exchange between Steed and Chevelle.
 They were trying to decide what to do with me.
 ‚ÄúSince you‚Äôre apparently not ready to retire for the evening, I suppose we will resume your training,‚Äù Chevelle said.
 I sighed.
 ‚ÄúOoh, let me!‚Äù Ruby shouted.

Where force is not possible, the only viable alternative is to build social consensus in support of the reform strategy.
 Ultimately, the success of the reform measures will be determined by one factor ‚Äì the extent to which the people understand, accept and are motivated to act under the new system.
 Before introducing any new measure, maximum effort should be made to communicate its purpose and nature to the people and win their understanding and approval.
 Public education is the most powerful policy instrument.
 With public opinion widely divided over the best course of action, it is necessary to win back the understanding, support and endorsement of the population for an alternative programme which the major parties and social groups can back.
 This requires educating the public to understand both the costs and benefits involved in any reform strategy, the trade-offs between immediate advantages and immediate sacrifices required to establish a new and stable equilibrium.
 3.Economic strategy must be balanced: A market economy can be introduced gradually or step-wise, but it cannot be introduced in a fragmentary or piecemeal manner.
 Deregulation of prices was the most prominent feature of the strategy in most countries, because it was the easiest to implement.
 But under conditions of shortages in economies dominated by huge monopolistic enterprises, price deregulation led to skyrocketing prices and spiralling inflation.
 A market flourishes only when several essential conditions are met ‚Äì freedom of pricing, freedom of entry and exit from industry, free flow of information, unrestricted movement of goods and services, competition between enterprises, control of monopolies, and private ownership of property.

 He liked holding her.
 And he'd been home at 5:30 every day, just as he'd promised--just because he wanted to be with her.
 Davis had never rearranged his schedule for her.
 Rick spent every moment of every evening with her.
 He'd even refused to play racquetball tomorrow with a friend who called last night because he wanted to spend both Saturday and Sunday with her.

 It was called blue lotus and was the predominant color in an Egyptian motif.
 She and her mother had attended a fashion show two weeks ago, and she'd loved the Egyptian patterns on the mannequins who'd modeled them.
 But the mannequins were thin women, and although she was slender, she had too many curves to be fashionable.
 Binding her breasts helped a little, but it was hard to hide her hips and derriere.
 And she was rather petite, which didn‚Äôt help matters.
 Davis smiled at her in the ugly, shapeless dress.
 "It's very pretty.
 But how could it not be, with you wearing it."
 She blushed, pleased with his compliment.

And there were so many children!
 They were loud and ran round the camp all afternoon.
 And they were just as varied as the adults.
 I examined their wide noses, rounded ears, and stubby fingers.
 Those who wore no shoes had short, thick toes like trolls.
 The men had patches of hair curled on their chests and forearms and some even grew it around their chins like goats.
 Their clothes were tattered and ill-fitting rags.
 They moved about the camp slowly.
 Clearly they had no magic, and they definitely were the owners of the crude tools we had found.
 They spoke to each other often, their voices like the protest of an old hound.

 Without his response, I kept on, explaining my dreams‚Äîpurposefully leaving out the part I had read about the northern clans‚Äîand closed my eyes in an attempt to see them clearer.
 I was recalling the details, her dark hair blowing in the wind, the feeling of being trapped, when my thoughts faded into the blackness of sleep.
 I woke in my own bed, the room lit by the dim light of a single flame suspended above my table.
 A flash of embarrassment hit as it dawned on me Chevelle must have placed me there; he must have seen my home, my room.
 And then I smiled, because he had left me a flame.
 I stretched my entire body, rejuvenated from the rest.
 I was unsure how long I‚Äôd slept but it looked like the sun was rising again and I wanted to be out of the house before I ran into Fannie.
 It was probably too early to hope to see Chevelle.
 I‚Äôd spent the last two days with him, but he hadn‚Äôt revealed anything of himself and that had only made me more curious.

The anti-social forces supporting these activities must be handled with the same firmness and determination applied to hijackers, regardless of whether they are governments, military, criminal or terrorist groups, corporations or banks.
 The power of these measures lies not in the enactment of laws but in their enforcement.
 Enforcement should be made mandatory and automatic.
 At the same time, it must be recognized that force alone can never eliminate these problems at their roots.
 Aggressive energies must be given constructive channels through which to express themselves positively in economic development.
 Unless and until famine and poverty are eliminated, both in developing countries and in the inner cities of the North, these energies will continue to find negative expression through violence.
 Therefore, a comprehensive approach is called for.
 The measures proposed here must be viewed in conjunction with recommendations made elsewhere in this report to eradicate hunger and unemployment.

 Isolated and independently pursued policies, which appeared highly beneficial at the time enacted, often result in unexpected and unwanted consequences that negate the benefits of the original measures.

Some of the other guards might be tempted to take what would not be given, but not him.

 The door to the top of Raven Tower was large and deeply carved in intricate designs and runes.
 Though as a youth Rodregas had trained in the basics of magic, a secret he was careful not to share, the magical runes were far beyond his understanding.
 He led the prisoners through the door and walked out onto the top of the tower.
 The circular roof was flat and open to the sky.
 The only covering was the landing for the stairs in the East corner.
 The cool night air refreshed his spirits somewhat.
 Before the prisoners could look around, he shoved them to the right side and strode over to Ravenhurr, who was peering into the night sky through a long tube with tiny glass panes at each end.
 Ravenhurr loved to boast that the tube brought the stars closer to him.

 She pointed me towards a chair in the corner of the room and told me I could get undressed and put my clothes on the chair.
 She excused herself, telling me that she was getting a towel to cover the bed where the massage would take place.
 I thought I could hear her whispering to someone in the apartment, but I only heard her voice.
 Now I was really wondering what I had walked in to.
 I labored to get my shoes off: A well placed moan and groan intended to prompt her curiosity.
 ‚ÄúAre you all right?‚Äù she asked, coming back into the room with a towel and spreading it flat onto the bed, then bending down and helping me untie my shoes.
 ‚ÄúI have back problems,‚Äù I said, standing to remove my dress shirt, exposing the back brace which I removed with angst.
 ‚ÄúHave your doctors given you anything for the pain?‚Äù she asked, helping my shirt off of each shoulder.

 As Ashley reaches for the door, she brings her phone up to her ear as if she has an incoming call.
 She is close enough for me to read her lips, just in front of the truck, her hand pushing the door open.

 Of course, she had the old man fooled, but Davis wasn't so easily deceived.
 Marie could tell that something was in the air that day.
 Her father and Davis kept exchanging looks over lunch, and they didn't shoo her and her mother from the table right after lunch so that they could discuss business.
 She suspected that Davis had something special planned for that evening, and when she caught her mother's glance over their teacups, she knew right away that her mother shared her suspicions.

 Yes, he was certainly right behind me, following me into town.
 Somehow I made it to the library without tripping or looking back, though I was nearly overcome with the temptation to turn at the door to see him one more time.
 The library steps curled around the interior of the tree, shelves cut into every space above and below, tables and racks and patrons scattered about the remaining areas.
 I found a dark, empty corner on the third level and relaxed onto a seat, leaning against the inside wall of the old tree and taking in the scent of ancient paper and binding.
 After a momentary pause to blot out the latest incident of poor self-control, I decided to attempt to locate the missing pages by magic.
 I had, after all, succeeded in growing only days ago.
 I concentrated as hard as I could and, though nothing flitted out of the shelves and onto my desk, I had a strong feeling I knew where the documents were.
 It also could have been that I knew where they had fallen from the day before.
 Regardless, I made my way over and took a few volumes and scrolls back to my secluded table.

 She'd been so caught up in their kisses and caresses that she probably wouldn't have stopped him no matter how he'd touched her.
 He could have made love to her.
 Yet he'd stopped.
 But he couldn't regret that decision.
 She'd probably let him make love to her, but she'd be devastated when it was over.
 Her morals were deeply ingrained, and the guilt would eat away at her.

Proven technology exists in many fields that await application because people do not know or do not believe that it can be employed successfully.
 Imitation of intensive aquaculture methods commonly employed by farmers in Taiwan and Singapore can raise average fish yields in South Asian, African and Latin American countries 25-fold.
 Advanced methods for micro-nutrient management can double or quadruple fruit and vegetable yields in most developing countries.
 A complete list of proven but untapped technologies and commercial opportunities should be compiled for each country, each region and local area.
 Programmes should be initiated to publicize information about commercialization of agriculture, stimulating industrialization, encouraging self-employment and new business start-ups, improving management practices, etc.
 Role of the media
 Free and well-developed media are vital to democratization and development.
 For this very reason, the dissemination of information by the media carries with it a great responsibility that cannot be effectively shouldered where private profit is the sole motive, or government control limits freedom of expression.
 The media can play an invaluable role in disseminating relevant information to the public, but the type and quality of information being carried in most developing countries must be radically improved.
 The worldwide tendency to focus on the immediate and dramatic at the expense of that which could make a substantial and lasting contribution to development requires greater efforts to creatively present socially useful information in an easily accessible and interesting form.

Feeling more than a little self-conscious, I tried to let go of his hand and scoot a little further away, but he maintained his grasp.

 The three sat there for a minute and then stepped away to rest against the far wall to get some distance from Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs body.
 After a few minutes Doi‚Äôvan said, ‚ÄúWell, one more Immortalist down, that‚Äôs good.‚Äù The other two nodded.
 Rodregas said, ‚ÄúWe did not learn much more though.
 We still don‚Äôt really understand why they are interested in Infernal power now and willing to break The One Law.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou mean if that is what they are doing.
 We really don‚Äôt know for sure, other than for Ravenhurr,‚Äù said Imeralda.
 Doi‚Äôvan, sounding like granite, said, ‚ÄúI know Taiga is involved.‚Äù The other two nodded, but did not pursue that thought.
 Rodregas then said, ‚ÄúI agree we are just starting to figure out that there is something big going on.
 I can‚Äôt believe even the Immortalists would be crazy enough to go up against both the Celestial Gods and the Daemon Lordsof the Infernal though.‚Äù Imeralda nodded and said, ‚ÄúWhat price is so high as to be even better than God hood?‚Äù The three sat silent for a few minutes soaking in that question.
 Rodregas looked at Imeralda and asked, ‚ÄúWell, we can‚Äôt answer that today, but how did you break Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs spell?‚Äù Imeralda nodded and with a smile said, ‚ÄúI always hoped that if I had to take on a sorcerer it would be in the Forest where I would have an edge, but no, it had to be in a hallway!

He relied on that as he turned a corner into the small space around their shed.
 Qurrah, who had been resting on the shallow grass, hurried to his feet at Harruq‚Äôs approach.
 ‚ÄúWhat is the matter?‚Äù he asked.
 ‚ÄúNothing, but you might want to hide in there.
 Quick!‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI will do no such thing,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúI said hey!‚Äù shouted the same man.
 Harruq stepped in front of Qurrah and then turned, staring down a group of five heavily armored guards.
 Swords and clubs hung from their belts, though a fifth carried a weapon neither of them had ever seen before.
 It was a wooden stick with a bulbous gem on one end.

It wasn't right for a girl to look at another girl like that.
 Like she couldn't wait to watch Vincent do all kinds of terrible things.
 "Payback sucks, doesn't it?"
 Jasmin's complete stillness was an eerie counterpoint to the waves of power still beating at me.
 I somehow knew she was just seconds away from springing when the sound of running footsteps caused all three to turn.
 Alec appeared around the corner, followed by Isaac, just a split second before Brandon sauntered into view from the opposite direction.
 The tingly feeling grew exponentially more powerful with so many more shape shifters present.
 Rubbing my arms did nothing to ward off the feeling that entire colonies of insects were skittering across my skin.
 Mr. Rindell's appearance forestalled what I'd been sure would turn into a full-blown fight.
 He sized up the situation with the canny eye of an educator who'd seen more fights over his career than most gang leaders.

It's gotten excellent reviews all over the U.S." I stared at her blankly, unsure where she was going.
 Some of her enthusiasm wilted in the face of my incomprehension.
 "I just thought maybe you'd want to go.
 You know.
 You said you loved the music, that it was what made you want to read the book.
 It's playing for more than a month, so there's plenty of time to make arrangements.
 I can set everything up if you want."
 It seemed impossible that she'd be so insensitive to my situation.
 I opened my mouth to tell her off, and then realized she wasn't privy to everything happening in my head.
 My world felt like it was disintegrating around me, and hers continued on as normal.

 He went to take a bottle from a drawer.
 "I'm not as red as I was last Saturday."
 "Do you-do you want me to-to rub some on you?"
 He glanced up, on the verge of asking her why, since it was only his arms, not his back, that needed the lotion.
 Instead, he silently handed her the bottle.
 Marie squeezed some lotion into her hand.
 Starting at his wrist, she rubbed his arm, working her way up.
 When she reached the tan line where his sleeve began, her hands glided up to the red spot just below his neck.

Our physics class was about the most sedate, nerdy group of people I'd yet met.
 If they were this worked up about the fight, it was a good thing I didn't share any other classes with Alec.
 The rest of the school must be three or four times as bad.
 Sketching helped block out all of the inane conversation that'd taken over the other corner of the room.
 It was amazing how easily I was able to zone out while drawing.
 Once again, I didn't try to guide my hand, just let my subconscious create a horizon and start fleshing out a body of water and droopy trees around it.
 The sound of a hand coming down hard on a desk pulled me from my refuge.
 "I told you all to keep it to a dull roar.
 I want everyone back to your seats."
 A couple people looked like they wanted to give the sub a hard time, but these were all the kids who were hoping to make it into the top ten percent of their graduating class.

During the dinner, Richard asked if I could ‚Äúscore some toot‚Äù which I discovered meant find cocaine.
 Well, I didn‚Äôt need to look much past my pocket to score, so we ended up getting drunk and snorting toot to commemorate our father and son reunion.
 At the time, it seemed like, ‚ÄúWow, my dad is cool,‚Äù but I later realized how sick it all truly was.
 The fact is, this man was never a father or a dad or anything to me.
 Richard basically knocked my mother up in high school, married her, had another son and abandoned her and his sons while they were still babies.
 He never paid my mother a dime in child support.
 My mother tried to warn me when I decided I wanted to meet him, but as only time would tell, trying to tell your teenage son anything is a virtual impossibility.

 Rodregas nodded.
 The beasts looked to be made of flesh and bone, except they all stood perfectly still on short stone pedestals.
 Strangely, the room did not smell of damp stone like the rest of the cathedral, but the air smelled of the outdoors in spring.
 Rodregas‚Äô eyes were drawn to the powerful lion that reared up not far into the gathered animals, and just to the right of the center.
 He walked over to it.
 It looked like it could have been the twin for the beast that had been devoured by the blue flame on top of Raven Keep.
 He stepped up close looking up at the beast; he was massive!
 The beast‚Äôs mouth was open, not as if he was going to roar, but simply in relaxed pose.
 He looked like he had been caught stalking forward on the hunt.

 The music started up before I could ask what he meant.
 Almost before I realized what was going on, I found myself twirling through some kind of modified waltz.
 For the first time in my life, I was glad Dad had drilled me for all of those weeks when I'd turned twelve.
 My first dance had still been complete and utter misery, but at least I managed not to trip over my own feet as Alec led me around the room in time to archaic music.
 The rest of the pack fell into formation around us, all dancing much more proficiently than me.
 James and Dominic led the way, with Jasmin and Rachel dancing off to our left.
 Amazingly enough, Isaac and Jessica were far and away the best; he was leading her through steps that were at least twice as hard as anything we were trying.

I, on the other hand, was extremely happy I'd made a good enough impression to get a job.
 I didn't like sitting there while Britney badmouthed Mrs. Campbell.
 I looked up during one of Britney's infrequent pauses for air, and caught Alec staring at me.
 Staring wasn't quite the right word though.
 Strangely enough, it didn't seem like he was necessarily mad, but he didn't seem happy either.
 I only caught his eyes for a few seconds before he looked away, but even his normally riveting blue eyes couldn't distract me from my inability to identify the look.
 I was used to people disliking me, ignoring me, or even occasionally liking me, but this was the first time I'd met someone who seemed to be still trying to decide what camp to join long past the time when most kids our age would have either made a decision or just decided I was weird and started ignoring me.
 Britney seemed to be getting suspicious that I wasn't really listening, so I had to make a lot of eye contact over the next few minutes.
 When I finally got a chance to look back up, Alec and his friends weren't at their table.
 Cassie caught my eye before I looked down, but she was definitely glaring.

Two-thirds of the UK workforce have no vocational or professional qualification, compared with only 25 per cent in Germany.
 There is growing support in the United States for establishment of a national youth apprenticeship training programme that combines classroom schooling with on-the-job skills training to ensure a smooth transition to employment for those who do not pursue higher education.
 11.Link demilitarization to urban employment: The military possesses both the expertise and the physical infrastructure for training large numbers of people in a wide range of technical, vocational and social skills.
 Building upon success ful US Defence Department programmes that re-deploy soldiers to assist troubled inner city youth, closed military bases can be converted into large training centres operated by military teaching staff for instructing and housing urban unemployed youth during an apprenticeship period.
 12.Promote integrated urban development programmes: The Atlanta Project is a bold attempt to evolve a new type of organization to address the problems of inner city poverty and unemployment.
 The inner city of Atlanta, Georgia, has been divided into clusters in which members of the local community work closely with the staff of major corporations, voluntary agencies, religious groups and a wide range of government agencies to identify and promote employment opportunities and other poverty-alleviation activities.
 13.Promote organizational innovation: In recent years, large firms have made significant strides in improving their speed, efficiency and flexibility of response to changing market conditions by restructuring operations into independent companies and autonomous profit-centres.
 Small firms need to develop new types of organizations to help them acquire some of the benefits of larger size.
 An innovative experiment has been launched by two dozen small precision-manufacturing, defence contractors in the state of Kansas, with the support of the US Defence Department, to combine their technical, organizational and marketing resources for diversification into non-defence production.
 Initiatives of this type can help strengthen the 12,000 small tool and die-making companies in the United States as well as millions of other small companies in other industries and other countries.

 The class was quiet for several seconds, before a hand finally shot up.

He'd spent that evening and yesterday evening doing exactly what he was doing tonight: sitting in front of the TV, not seeing, not hearing, not moving.
 How could she have become so much a part of him in only five weeks?
 He'd been engaged to a woman who hadn't been as deeply imbedded in his heart and soul as Marie.
 How could his life ever be complete again without her?
 He wondered if she was feeling the same way.
 Was she finding that home wasn't the same as it had been before she'd fallen in love with him?
 Did she wonder how she could ever feel complete again?
 But no--she was dead!
 The agony of that realization pierced his numbed heart.
 This was 2011; she'd gone back to 1927, been reunited with her family, probably gotten married and had children.

But they had overlooked a tell-tale sign of their nuptials: The event would be published under ‚Äúwedding announcements‚Äù in that little town‚Äôs newspaper, just a few miles down a rural road.
 Their secret was revealed over the high school intercom when they were both summoned from their classes to the Principal‚Äôs office.
 The announcer, heard by all who attended this rural school in the center of Hoisington, Kansas, called my father‚Äôs name, Richard T. DeHaven, and then my mother‚Äôs newly acquired married name, Karla June DeHaven.
 It echoed through the classrooms, with a collective gasp from students and teachers.
 They were excused from class, walked through the desks that lined the classroom, all eyes following them out the door.
 Their parents stood with the principal ready for their arrival at the office.
 As they entered the room it wasn‚Äôt hard to see the anger and disappointment.
 They were from different sides of this small town.
 My father‚Äôs dad was a butcher, his wife a seamstress.

 ‚ÄúNo, what I _must_.‚Äù
 The words felt hollow, nothing more than self-serving lies.

I opened my mouth to scream, only to find that no sound would come out.
 The world was still spinning, but I was oriented just enough to realize that Dominic had her hand over my mouth and nose.
 I pulled at her arm, but the effort was completely futile.
 Rising panic over not being able to breathe made me hammer at the iron bar pressing me against her, but she never looked away from whatever had captured her concentration.
 Rachel suddenly appeared off to my right, and she put her finger to her lips, and then sank all ten fingernails into Dominic's arm.
 The sudden absence of the support I'd been unconsciously using to keep weight off of my right foot resulted in tear-jerking pain as the damaged appendage touched down, but I gritted my teeth and managed to keep it down to a hiss.
 Rachel draped my arm over her shoulders, and then dragged me forward a couple of awkward, hopping steps.
 A couple of heartbeats passed before I realized the pool of shadow before us was Jessica.
 She had her eyes closed and was rocking back and forth as Rachel carefully pulled her to us.
 I mirrored Rachel's actions, wrapping my free arm around Jess as I whipped my head back and forth in an effort to figure out what was going on.

Never would he have guessed Harruq‚Äôs were older by three centuries.
 Never would he have guessed that those two blades would shatter his own, pass through the explosion of steel, sever his spine, and cleave his body in two.
 The half-orc continued his charge, engaging the two elves behind.
 They struck as one, their swords aiming for vitals high and low.
 Harruq knew he could not block both, so he accepted a thrust curving to the side of his armor, grinning darkly.
 As the sword punched through the enchanted leather, the half-orc cut his adversary‚Äôs throat, using that same swing to parry the other attack away.
 The remaining elf swore as his eyes grew red and watery.
 He backed away from the half-orc, his sword held defensively before him.

It wasn't until his arm brushed me that I realized he was shaking ever so slightly himself.
 "There's only one way you're going to touch her, James.
 Are you really ready to take that step?"
 I felt shivers run down me as I realized just how easily everything could boil over into deadly violence.
 The tension in the room pulsed out in waves, skittering many-legged across my skin like something that belonged under a rock somewhere.
 The feeling intensified even more as first Jessica and then Jasmin picked up the same strange, near epileptic quiver.
 James let out a low, grating growl, and my stomach dropped as he looked up with eyes that weren't the unremarkable brown they'd been just a second before.
 The hot yellow eyes of a predator were looking out of James' familiar face, changing it into something threatening and inhuman.
 Answering growls from Jasmin and Jessica seemed to snap something inside of Alec.
 His tremble became more pronounced.

I can‚Äôt wait long because I have a tendency to go crazy, so I walked up to my window sill and looked at the sky.
 I stared it and turned around to see Emily come back in.
 But not before my eyes caught a flash of blue.
 Emily and I parked our bikes and headed into the woods and towards the clearing.
 We stepped into it, and I took in the familiar feeling.
 Out of all the places we‚Äôve all been, this place felt the safest, as if it were surrounded by a good force, not bad for once.
 We often met here when we weren‚Äôt all together.
 I sat down next to Emily on a log.
 Minutes later Jason and Seth emerged from the trees.
 They weren‚Äôt smiling or doing anything suspicious so I figured we were safe, for now.

Picnics had swapped off with treasure hunts and then been replaced by other activities depending on Dad's mood and my age.
 My subconscious had keyed in on the one scene guaranteed to make me feel miserable.
 "Was that close to your house in Minnesota?
 I..." Whatever else Alec was saying was lost to the roar in my ears, caused as always by my racing heart.
 I didn't even have a chance to try and fight the attack.
 By the time I realized I was in trouble, papers were flying off my desk and the floor was racing up to meet me.
 Rather than swimming around in blackness like I normally did when collapsed, this time there was just nothing.
 One second I was falling, the next I was opening my eyes and looking up at Alec.
 "Stand back, everyone, and let me through!"
 It took a few seconds to realize the sub was the one yelling.

The nexus between democracy and prosperity is undeniable.
 The democratic revolution that has so effectively penetrated Eastern Europe in recent years and extended its roots in other regions must be taken to its logical conclusion at the level of nations and at the level of international institutions.
 World Peace Army: The most far-sighted of ICPF‚Äôs proposals sought to evolve a practical mechanism to promote the objectives of cooperative security and democratic freedom.
 It called for the establishment of a World Peace Army, to be constituted by and open to all democratic countries willing to renounce the right to aggression against other nations and willing to contribute personnel and resources to an international multilateral military force capable of defending its members from external threats.
 Such a mechanism, so long as it is inclusive, would provide a real and viable alternative to national militarization, whether or not it was constituted by or within the UN system.
 The success of NATO in maintaining peaceful relations among the democratic states of Western Europe and North America for more than half a century is a viable model which is limited primarily by the exclusivity of its membership.
 The recent measures taken by the European Union to constitute a European Army are evidence of the practicality of establishing a similar mechanism open to all nations.
 The unfortunate situation now witnessed in Iraq could have been avoided, if ICPF‚Äôs plea for a World Peace Army had been heeded.
 Eradicating the Roots of Terrorism: Terrorism is not new to the world, but with the withdrawal of national rivalries between East and West, violence by non-nation states has increased in intensity and is viewed as a far greater security concern by the entire world.
 This has spurred an unprecedented international effort to control and suppress terrorist activity.

 The syphons were starting to look uneasy, hesitating before they flung themselves at us.
 It didn't matter to me.
 ‚ÄúRetreat!‚Äù one of the voices yelled.
 ‚ÄúFall back!‚Äù They gave one more angry hiss at us and disappeared into the woods.
 The bushes and trees rattled and then the woods were silent.
 I could hear everyone's heavy breaths as we turned to face each other.
 Well, actually everyone turned to me.

I squeezed my fingers around it, as if to verify it was real, but when I opened my hand again it was only the dull gray rock.
 Disappointment filled my face as I looked back at him.
 He tilted his head toward the stone; I would have to make this sculpture myself.
 I closed my fist around it, mostly because I had seen him do the same, and instantly I knew what I wanted to see.
 I opened my palm up, grinning triumphantly, and exposed my creation for Chevelle to see.
 Balancing there was a slightly misshapen but undeniable sculpture of a small black horse.
 Chevelle rolled his eyes.
 Still smiling, I looked back to the stone, but it had returned to its uninteresting round shape.
 Chevelle answered my unspoken question.
 ‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ tricky.‚Äù He smiled a little at using Steed‚Äôs word.

She'd known I couldn't handle the reminder of what we'd lost, but she'd been unwilling to give up that link to the past.
 The thought slipped away like sunlight skipping across water a split second before the storm arrived.
 The attack was a bad one.
 I lost more time.
 I must have slept at some point, but the next time I surfaced it was Saturday morning and I was sitting in front of an empty bowl with an unopened box of cereal and a gallon of milk waiting in the wings.
 At some point I realized I wasn't hungry.
 I put everything back away and went upstairs for a shower.
 It didn't help.
 By the time I was done, I was clean but just as emotionally numb as before.
 At least I'd turned the water all the way to cold there at the end.

 They went to the living room, and he put it in her copy of The Dragonriders of Pern.

I really did want to spend time with him.
 Even if he wasn't going to touch me, being with him was better than being anywhere else.
 "This is a mistake.

 "But if you did, would you care?"
 "Probably not, but that doesn't change the fact that this is what I want to do."
 His sigh was ample evidence he didn't believe me.
 It probably didn't help that I'd moved in closer as I finished speaking, but I was already worrying about something else he'd said.

 Having him so close to me was somehow both exhilarating and soothing at the same time.
 I could feel the tense, knotty parts of me start to relax for the first time since Simon and Nathanial tried to kill me.
 As exhaustion started to finally eat through all of the nervous energy that'd been fueling me, it was all I could do to follow what Alec was saying.
 Still, I wasn't ready to go to sleep.
 It felt like he'd disappear if I closed my eyes.
 "So you don't need to sleep.
 What do you do with all the rest of your time?"
 Alec was close enough now that I could see his smile.

This timely report should help to promote the idea of human-centred development within a culture of peace as a way forward to a better world.
 We are gratified that ICPF should have assigned UNESCO, as the intellectual arm of the United Nations, a prominent role in its recommended agenda for action, and we reaffirm our commit ment to working with all possible partners in pursuit of the goal of global peace and sustainable human development.
 Federico Mayor Director General UNESCO
 The International Commission on Peace and Food began its work at a time of uncommon opportunities for rapid transition on a global scale to democratic ways of life, freedom of the media, and an independent judiciary; food, literacy, health and jobs for all; and sustainable life styles based on harmony between humankind and nature.
 The end of the Cold War and the consequent shift of expenditure from defence to development, the onset of the Information Age and the organization of information superhighways, the growth of mechanisms for regional cooperation, a renewed faith in the United Nations, and commitment to multilateral negotiations and action all provided new opportunities for achieving global peace and prosperity.
 Rapid progress in the application of science and technology in agriculture, industry, and human health strengthened the hope that the concept of 'food, education, health and employment for all' can be converted from rhetoric into reality, provided the peace dividend can be deployed to achieve these goals.
 ICPF had the advantage of building on the work of earlier independent commissions, particularly those chaired by Willy Brandt, Gro Harlem Brundtland and Julius Nyerere.
 We began our work with the conviction that, as Willy Brandt said, 'the problems created by men can be solved by men'.
 The ancient Indian scripture, Bhagavad Gita, expressed the same sentiment by stressing, 'Whatever man aspires to, that he can accomplish.'
 The achievement of food self-sufficiency by India in a period when famine threatened millions of lives through the power of political will and scientific action in a democratic society illustrates this truth.

Kapow, our race is a goner.
 See that coming and, walloped by dread reality, spooked beyond reach of old customs and authority, our nature cries, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs out there somewhere, whatever it is.
 Go find it.‚Äù Eric and I bought Kerouac‚Äôs On the Road, and checked out Dharma Bums and his latest, Big Sur, a memoir in minimal disguise, about a fellow who goes to a cabin in the forest to recover from drunkenness and fame.
 Imagine Henry David Thoreau as a neurotic who returns to Walden Pond and finds psychosis awaiting him there.
 Still, we concluded that a poet of Kerouac's passion and skill, who could make a hangover feel romantic, would pull out of his tailspin and rise again.
 That fall, Eric and I read most every day, then sat in my backyard or on a beach or sea cliff and talked for hours at a spell.
 Also, we worked at odd jobs, sold some possessions, and saved most of whatever our moms gave us.
 We needed gas money, so we could chase visions of Kerouac and his Beat pals through the places they haunted at the west end of their cross-country odysseys.
 Twice that fall, the minute school let out on Friday, we sped north on Highway 101.
 From Morro Bay to Santa Cruz, we followed the coast and made camp for the night on a cliff between Hearst Castle and Big Sur.

I could feel my mind trying to shut down, hoping to cushion me from the worst implications of what was coming.
 I knew it was going to be bad, could feel it in a sickening, only-seconds-away-from-vomiting kind of way, but couldn't follow the chain of logic through to the very end.
 I let Jasmin help me pull my books together, and then numbly followed her out to the hallway.
 Alec and the rest of the pack were waiting for us at my locker.
 Jasmin calmly opened my locker and put my things away while I was still trying to come to terms with everything.
 Alec took my hand.
 "Are you okay?"
 I shook my head.
 "This is going to be really bad, isn't it?"
 His silence validated my belief, probably even more than he realized.

My mom and aunt were dressed for breakfast by the time we arrived, to their surprise and dismay.
 They loaned us their room until evening.
 Room service delivered bourbon and ginger ale.
 Around noon, we adjourned to the pool, on the lookout for showgirls.
 At least that was my motive.
 The pool featured a high dive like the one at Carmen Ranch Club where Eric worked part-time as an apprentice lifeguard and trampoline instructor.
 He climbed, sprang, jackknifed and got a few cheers from spectators, including several showgirls.
 Though I had never attempted a high dive before, after some bourbon, the feat looked simple.
 Inches from the end of the board was a depression full of water, on which my foot slipped.
 I tried to stop, but too late.

East Asia alone, excluding Japan and China, will spend about $900 billion on infrastructure between 1992 and 2000.
 During this decade, China and India will add 21,000 megawatts of electricity generation every year and more telephone switching capacity than the United States and Japan combined.
 Latin America‚Äôs annual requirements for investment in power, water and sewage, telecommunications and transport infrastructure are estimated at $60 billion.
 Rising incomes and increasing exports to the dynamic economies of Asia and Latin America could generate as many as 1.7 million jobs by the end of the decade in the United States alone.
 The growth of the developing economies could provide the major impetus for economic expansion and job creation in both developed and developing countries.
 Government policies based on recognition of this fact can considerably improve the climate for development of these nations and correspondingly stimulate further growth in the West.
 Freer international trade will generate a flood of cheaper goods from the developing world that will give rise not only to greater purchasing power and higher standards of living for the Western consumer, but also to a ‚Äòdemand boom‚Äô for sophis ticated Western goods and services to improve infrastructure and meet the needs of billions of consumers in developing countries.
 The vast inequalities in living standards that persist within both developing and industrial nations, and between the most and least economically developed countries, result in an enormous global loss of incomes and jobs.
 Accelera ting the development of poorer nations and poorer sections of the population in each country is the most powerful instrument and the surest guarantee of continued growth of jobs and incomes for everyone in the next century.

Some will continue for several more years.
 Still others may entirely reverse their direction and contribute to job growth later in the decade.
 Not one is an irreversibly negative factor that will continue to exert a downward pressure on job growth for the foreseeable future.
 Job Creation during the Twentieth Century
 A long-term, global perspective is needed to understand fully the employment problem and the prospects for eliminating it.
 Over the past four decades, the world economy has generated more than one billion jobs, more than were created during the previous four centuries.
 If past trends continue, it will create another 1.3 billion during the next 35 years.
 The current anxiety in the West is similar to that which the United States passed through in the 1890s when agricultural mechanization displaced 4.4 million farm workers, generating double digit unemployment and visions of a dismal future.
 Yet, since then, employment in the United States has expanded by nearly 100 million jobs or 400 per cent.
 Between 1990 and 2005, it is projected to increase by another 25 million.

He had only been working at Raven Keep for a little over a year at the time and was still learning the names of the prisoners.
 Rodregas had thought that Jorin was a good lad, well behaved and bright, and his eyes were eager for signs of hope.
 Rodregas brought him extra food and words of reassurance.
 Ravenhurr had no need for him nor his mother, and he had seen other prisoners who were not of use set free.
 Rodregas had thought that Jorin would also be set free.
 Two months went by and Rodregas had developed a strong fondness for the boy; a few of the guards made jokes that Rodregas had a new pet.
 Rodregas was used to the rough humor of soldiers and let such jokes roll off.
 The night came when the father was taken for the ceremony.
 Rodregas was on guard duty when Korin came down in his new body.
 The poor lad had stared at the man who had been his father, saying nothing, but tears ran down his cheeks.

After the initial detox period, we used professional grade drug tests and surprised him with them.
 He always had an excuse for why he couldn‚Äôt pee.
 I would hand him a bottle of water and tell him I would wait.
 He was never truly clean.
 When he slept, I went into the bedroom to see if his chest was inflating with air to assure me he was still alive.
 It reminded me of when our boys were babies and sometimes we would check on them in the night or as they napped and we never left the room until we verified they were breathing just because that is what a parent does.
 Chapter 15: Happy Frickin‚Äô Holidays!
 As Thanksgiving approached, our traditions looked impossible to pull off.
 We were evasive when we called my wife‚Äôs parents to tell them not to come to our house as they usually did.
 We said we had some personal family issues to deal with.

The defeated Axis powers, Germany and Japan, were relegated to the back ground.
 Mainland China had become communist and was therefore excluded from the power structure.
 India and the other colonies had not yet gained their freedom.
 In recognition of the mutual suspicions between Russia and the Western powers, the rule of unanimity usually adopted by political conferences was applied to decisions made by the five major powers that became the permanent members of the Security Council.
 The rest of the world was poorly represented.
 Only 51 nations ‚Äì including only two African states, two East Asian nations and three Soviet republics ‚Äì out of the current total of 184 UN members were present at its founding.
 This structure is based on political realities that no longer hold true.
 As the limitations of the League led to renewed conflagration two decades later, so the arrangements underlying the establishment of the UN contained within them the seeds of the confrontation between the superpowers and the Cold War.
 The present international system of governance is as far from being truly representative and ‚Äòdemocratic‚Äô as many erstwhile authoritarian governments that incorporated the popular adjective in the names of their parties or states.
 The UN Charter assigns primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security to the Security Council of 15 members, of whom five are permanent members with veto power over all matters.

 For a second I thought he was going to argue with her.
 His tired smile had the feel of resignation, of something that'd been well argued over the years.
 "Will you play something for us, Mother?
 Adriana hasn't had the pleasure of listening to your songs."
 I'd rarely seen anyone change moods so quickly.
 "No.

 Yes, you can bring Rachel, but I can't let anyone listen to it before it's ready."

If he was truly strong enough for two as Imeralda thought, then he could be a lion and what else?
 ‚ÄúWell, Doi‚Äôvan, what do you think?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 ‚ÄúI am going to choose lion, but it would be great to have a pride, or maybe the Moon Wolf or the Mountain Bear.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan nodded and walked over to the bear.
 It was a kind of bear that Rodregas had not heard of in the mortal world, even larger than ‚Äòhis‚Äô lion.
 The bear actually had a thick tail and its teeth seemed far larger than any bear he had heard of.
 Doi‚Äôvan stood there looking up at the great beast for a long moment.
 Then he cocked his head; his nose went up as if he smelled something.
 He stepped around the great bear and headed toward the back wall.
 The score of statues, while separated, were clustered in the middle of the great room.
 The four walls of the room seemed to be set back with the ceiling gently coming down in the form of great arches.

A loud wooden crash stole away the elf‚Äôs focus.
 The door to the home behind him exploded into splinters as a huge projectile shot through it.
 The elf spun, his eyes widening as he saw what had shattered the door: a massacred elven body.
 He readied his bow and released an arrow at the next sign of movement.
 Unfortunately, it was another elven body, curiously missing its left arm and leg.
 An enormous half-orc in black armor followed, soaked in blood and roaring in mindless fury.
 He spotted Antonil‚Äôs attacker, screamed an incomprehensible challenge, and then charged.
 The elf fired another arrow but was horrified to see it sail high.
 Behind him, Antonil delivered another kick, this time aiming for the elf‚Äôs knee instead of his bow.
 The elf had to dodge the kick, and that dodge was all it took.

My eyes widened as I saw Seth and then darkness.
 But not before the voice said one more thing.
 ‚ÄúBeware of each other.‚Äù *** I opened my eyes and shot up so fast my head collided with Seth's.

 ‚ÄúWhat's wrong?‚Äù he asked.

 ‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù I looked at the beads of sweat on his forehead.
 ‚ÄúWhat's wrong with you?‚Äù ‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúI'm just hot because when someone sleeps on someone else, that person kind of gets hot.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù He shook his arm.

But, at my level, even attempting to adore God is calling for plenty of effort.
 Which I'm beginning to see as the point of this trip I had thought was meant to sell books.
 Still, if God asks me to give up Zo√´, I'll fight him.
 My friend Diane Otocar, a lay sister with Mother Teresa‚Äôs Missionaries of Charity, told me about a fellow who asked Mother what he should do for her and her ministry.
 ‚ÄúDo you have a family?‚Äù she asked.
 ‚ÄúI do,‚Äù he admitted.
 She said, ‚ÄúFirst, take care of your family.‚Äù "So there," I mumble.
 Out of all the people since Jesus, I can‚Äôt think of any whose advice I should trust more than Mother Teresa‚Äôs.
 But I know we humans can talk ourselves into or out of most anything.

Violent local conflicts continue to flare around the world.
 Terrorist acts have intensified against civilian populations on every continent.
 While the worst fears about rising unemployment in the West have been dispelled, the challenge of generating sufficient employment opportunities for all people around the world remains a pressing concern.
 The rich-poor divide has increased within and between nations.
 Inadequate job/livelihood opportunities resulting in inadequate purchasing power have now become the most important cause of endemic and hidden hunger.
 Most regrettable has been the failure to enhance the powers and strengthen reliance on effective multilateral institutions.
 The emergence of the USA as the sole superpower has brought with it a reduction in the role and influence of the UN in international affairs, precisely at a time when the world should be striving to build a viable multilateral cooperative security system.
 The Unfinished Agenda
 The Commission‚Äôs report was never intended to predict what would happen in the years to come, but rather to project what could be made to happen by a concerted, determined effort of the world community.
 The report highlighted many of the opportunities that did emerge as well as some of the dangers that have grown in intensity in the absence of effective action.

I unlaced my vest and threw it down, kicked off my shoes and fell into the blankets, stretching happily to finally have something like an actual bed.
 The conversation outside quieted and I slipped off to sleep, trying not to think about my capture and coming return to the village.
 ‚ÄúFreya.‚Äù A low voice broke into my dreams of gently rolling hills and soft gray stone.
 I peered through slitted eyes to see Chevelle standing outside the entrance, back to me as he watched a dull red horizon.
 I sat up, lacing the vest over the thin material of my blouse, and slid on my shoes to join him.
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs dawn,‚Äù I complained.
 ‚ÄúAnd good morning, sunshine,‚Äù Steed called from atop a large, black stallion.
 The beast‚Äôs nostrils flared, breath steaming in the cool morning air.
 Two more of the animals pawed in the distance behind him.
 Steed chirped a whistle and they walked forward, the slim, muscular one moving to stand beside Chevelle as a mammoth crossed in front of me and knelt.

My legs froze in place.

 Emily turned her head and was about to reply when the dog caught her robe.
 She spun around, shooting fire and completely forgetting my cry for help.
 At the same time my dog attacker pushed me to the ground, freeing my legs for me.
 ‚ÄúGet off me mutt.‚Äù I growled at his face.
 He stared down at me, debating whether or not to freeze me right away.
 That was his mistake because while he was waiting, I had brought my hunting dagger down on him.
 I stood up and shook the heavy body off.
 I didn‚Äôt even have time to breath before one of the Thrashers decided that they would like to have a taste of me.

Instead of resisting the attacker‚Äôs strength Rodregas pushed down on the earth with his hands and lifted his body up and to the side, curling the leg he had kicked out underneath.
 He planted his foot under his body.
 His attackers seemed confused, grabbing him and trying to counter his change of position.
 Rodregas only had one leg under him, but he pushed off with it with all his strength and thrust himself up.
 It should have failed with all the men holding him down, but he now had celestial strength, and even with the knife wound he was strong.
 His attackers backed off, confused by the fact that he had gone from being their prisoner to suddenly rising.
 The person pinning Rodregas‚Äô left arm got too far away.
 This gave Rodregas the leverage he needed to pull the arm free.
 He punched his assailant hard in the face.
 The attacker flew back and Rodregas jumped sideways to get more space.

‚ÄúSwear you will keep my secret and you live, do not and you die.

 Then he nodded and said, ‚ÄúIn the name of the All-Father, Lord of Sky and Earth and Water, I swear that I will keep your secrets.‚Äù Rodregas nodded and relaxed slightly; few would dare break a promise to the All-Father.
 Rodregas decided that Brit and Geor were like pale shadows as they quickly followed suit.
 When he turned to the last two he saw that they were very interested in what he was saying.
 ‚ÄúWhere do you go, Sir Paladin?‚Äù He showed no sense of humor at Rodregas‚Äô little joke about being a Paladin; Rodregas hoped Doi‚Äôvan had not taken him literally.
 ‚ÄúAs far as I can, is my main plan at the moment.

Another graceful gesture flipped on the set of soft lights surrounding its border.
 As always with Alec's paintings, it took me a second before I could shift my perspective enough to translate the beautiful formations of light into something I could tie to the drab, dreary world I inhabited.
 It was the same grotto where we now stood.
 The warm glow from the climbing ivory and roses formed a backdrop awash in the silvery light of a full moon.
 Just visible off to one side was the pool, alive with enough microscopic life to give it a pale glow of its own to compliment the off-center reflection of a hundred tiny lights.
 A few seconds later I finally recognized that the subject of the piece was a female, reaching out towards the point of view with glowing hands.
 "She's beautiful.
 It's how I always imagined an angel would appear."
 Alec was silent for so long I finally tore my gaze from his masterpiece long enough to find that he was staring at me with surprise.
 "It's you, Adri.

Alec's question should have been lost in the clamor of all of the kids walking by us, but I picked his voice out as easily as if we'd been alone together in the forest.
 Was that another mystical power granted to alpha shape shifters, or just because I was so hyper-aware of him?
 "I thought you said we'd get in trouble if we started cutting school."
 His easy, graceful shrug pulled his black polo shirt tight across his shoulders.
 It seemed impossible that anyone could be so well built and tightly ripped that you'd be able to see every muscle through his clothing, but there he was.
 "I may have exaggerated slightly.
 Odds are that I can convince the secretaries to make your absence here disappear, and mine hardly matters."
 I throttled down my first impulse, the almost overwhelming desire to say yes, to do anything required to spend more time with him, and instead focused on the opportunity to get inside his head, to learn some of the things moving him.
 "But that isn't why you want to skip."
 "No, I find that I'm strangely unconcerned right now with what the future may bring, and this seems entirely too good an opportunity to waste on a substitute that knows even less about physics than we do."

Rodregas felt a feeling of relief at the idea that the lions had eaten.
 Still, he double-checked the keep and the courtyard very carefully before bringing out the cart and the horses and loading up all his booty.
 The cart groaned with the load.
 After a last check for Dire Cats in front of the keep he headed out and away from both Raven Keep and Raven Town and away from his old life.
 CHAPTER 4 A FRESH START OR AN OLD PROBLEM
 Raven Keep, unlike many fortifications, was not located on a high spot.
 In fact, it was perched half way down a gentle valley.
 Farther down the valley, only a few minutes‚Äô ride away was Raven Town.
 Even the kindest of folk would admit the town was not much more than an inn, a stable, the homes of the people that supported the local farming community, and of course, Raven Keep.
 Many of the keep employees and their family members lived in Raven Town.

 My thanks received only a nod in return, and then Rachel was waving goodbye as they backed down the lane.
 The Jeep was gone, of course.
 I wiped away the beginnings of perspiration as I climbed our steps.
 It was still hot enough outside that I knew it was going to be miserable inside.
 By the time I reached the door I was contemplating just finding a decent tree and spending the afternoon outside.
 The sight of a white envelope, barely visible against the off-white door, was enough to drive those thoughts out of my head.
 It had my name on the side that'd been facing the door.

The rule of unanimity or veto power cannot be an effective principle of governance in a world of complex and diverse interests, as the recent conflict of interests within the European Union also illustrates.
 Those nations that regard themselves as the standard bearers of democracy and human rights within nations cannot justify denying these principles between nations.
 World peace and prosperity in the coming decades will depend on our willingness boldly to confront this issue.
 At the end of the Second World War the victorious nations joined together to found the UN.
 At the end of the Cold War, the organization needs to be re-founded, and restructured according to democratic principles, to give a more active role and more equitable representation to people of all nations.
 To deem such considerations unrealistic given the present alignment of power in the world is a short-sighted view.
 It ignores the incredible speed and scope of changes that have radically transformed international relations over the past half decade.
 It assumes that the present system has the backing of the international community and that it can and will sustain itself regardless of whatever steps we may contemplate.
 A fundamental change in structure is essential and inevitable.
 The break-up of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War have resulted in the demise of the bipolar system which dominated international relations after 1945.

Seth grinned at my clumsiness and waited for me to walk up to him.
 I wacked his head with the back of my hand, making his hair stick up.
 He smoothed it down and we walked across the flat ground.
 The ground had spots of grass sticking out of sand and rock.
 Luckily, there was no wind down here to toss up the sand and dirt.
 I think I passed the spot where the Kojas had stood in my dream.
 I threw the thoughts out of my head and tried to think of something else.
 Like, where this flat plain of flatness ended.
 ‚ÄúWhere are we going, anyway?‚Äù I asked and stared at the sky.
 It was going to get dark soon.

‚ÄúI am the voice of Karak.

 You are strong, and I sense your anger raging to be unleashed.‚Äù
 Harruq trembled, indeed feeling that anger.
 He felt it deep inside his chest, urging him to rise and defy Velixar.
 ‚ÄúThe orcish were elves who swore their lives to Karak.
 Part of you still yearns to do what your ancestors have done.
 They reveled in bloodshed, warred against men who followed a false god.
 I offer you a chance to do as you were meant to and serve Karak.

"Always observing the old forms, aren't you, Alec.
 Well now it's time for a whole new batch."
 One second Brandon was a human, the next he was a huge monstrosity, a thing that normally dwelt in the bottom, most primitive parts of the mind, venturing out only to star prominently in nightmares.
 The rush of power beat back at our entire pack.
 If it'd been a physical wind it would've knocked me over.
 Intangible or not, it still staggered me and only my grip on Jasmin and Dom kept me from dropping to my knees.
 Alec stood motionless for a pair of seconds, and then seemed to explode and melt back into himself.
 I blinked, and his human body had been replaced with the hybrid form that'd saved my life once before.
 Only this time he wasn't fighting wolves, he was fighting another hybrid, and Brandon towered over him.
 There was another ripple of movement on the other side of the light.

 Chapter 1 Stepping back out into the relentless desert sun, I once again wished we were still back in Minnesota, or at least that we were done moving.
 Then again I might as well have been wishing that Mom had decided on somewhere other than Utah, or that we'd had some long-lost relative die and leave us a small fortune, or even better that Dad and Cindi...
 The thought was much too dangerous to complete.
 My breathing had already sped up, and my balance degenerated so quickly it was a small miracle I made it over to the U-Haul before I keeled over.
 I'd hated the battered vehicle that had spent the last two days carrying us west across I-80.
 It was hard to keep up the feeling though when it was the only thing protecting me from a concussion.
 Half of the horizon was green and beautiful, not land-of-ten-thousand-lakes beautiful, but still not bad.

 I awoke in the entryway and he was gone.
 I rolled to my knees and I could hear the crackle of the puka shells beneath the weight of my body.
 I felt the shells of my coveted necklace sticking to my palms as I tried to steady myself on all fours.
 With my focus and clarity returning, I quietly gathered up all the shells I could, put them in my pockets and went to my room.
 I was alive, but the puka shell necklace was a goner.
 On one final occasion, my parents were having a large party at the house.
 I was sitting at a desk in my room doing some schoolwork and I could hear the guests‚Äô loud voices in the hallway beyond my door.
 Suddenly my door burst open and slammed against the wall.

I fumbled, for the latch, but Rachel put a hand on my arm before I could get the door open.
 She handed me a white-wrapped package with a shy smile.
 "Hang in there.
 Oh, and happy birthday.
 Don't open it now, but I hope you like it."
 I whispered thanks as I hugged her goodbye, and then made my halting, limping way into the house.
 I was only in the house for fifteen minutes before I realized being all by myself was a terrible idea.
 At some point I transitioned from just crying to having a full-blown panic attack.
 It should've terrified me that something new was bringing on an episode, but it was like there was so much else going wrong I couldn't spare any more emotional energy.
 I came out of the attack and remained on the floor thinking about all of the good times I'd had with Dad and Cindi.

‚ÄúAnd, if you ask nicely, I will even leave you a few supplies to get to the nearest town if you promise not to tell anyone that you saw me.
 And you will promise that in the name of the All-Father, or you will die at my hand.‚Äù Rodregas did not smile now, nor did they.
 ‚ÄúSo you think you could kill all of us?
 Put your sword down now!‚Äù demanded Audrian.
 Rodregas stepped forward and buried just the tip of his right-handed short sword into Audrian‚Äôs chest, hitting the ribs but not shoving the blade through.
 Audrian gasped in surprise and fell back.
 ‚ÄúSwear you will keep my secret and you live, do not and you die.
 Choose!‚Äù Audrian just stood there looking at him.
 Then he nodded and said, ‚ÄúIn the name of the All-Father, Lord of Sky and Earth and Water, I swear that I will keep your secrets.‚Äù Rodregas nodded and relaxed slightly; few would dare break a promise to the All-Father.
 Rodregas decided that Brit and Geor were like pale shadows as they quickly followed suit.

He held hope that Harruq still fought against his enemies, or that more had come beyond the three the elf had claimed.
 What he was not prepared for was the sight of Harruq hunched over the dying body of Aurelia Thyne.
 ‚ÄúHarruq,‚Äù he tried to call out.
 The flesh in the back of his throat tore.
 Blood poured down his throat, slick and hot.
 Qurrah cursed.
 Such a wound would kill him if he did not seek help.
 He needed to steal more life, and for that, he needed another body.
 He glanced behind.
 The dead elf was dry, but far down the street were two more he and his brother had killed.

At last the man crumpled, the bloodied shard of glass from the bottle still in his hand.

 Painful too, he noticed as he took a few steps.
 Furious, he turned back to the corpse of the drunken man and smashed a fist against its chest.
 The body shriveled into dust, only the bones remaining.
 ‚ÄúHalt!‚Äù shouted a voice from far down the street.
 Qurrah glimpsed an elf carrying a bow.
 Just one, the half-orc noticed, but that would quickly change.
 ‚ÄúPerhaps you‚Äôll have some use after all,‚Äù Qurrah said to the bones.

 I counted two thrashers, which surprised me.
 I swear we saw more before.
 The thrasher turned before we could execute a surprise attack.
 Seth marched over, swinging his sword.
 Jason threw knives calmly at the other monster while Emily casted fire by his side.
 I, however, was jumped on by something entirely new.

Then he saw her.
 Rodregas had been trying to look into the tree, thinking of his experience of being pulled into the Night Panther.
 But then he heard a noise and looked up and saw that she was on a branch high above, looking incredibly small.
 She seemed to be trying to reach something.
 ‚ÄúImeralda!‚Äù he yelled at her.
 But she seemed caught up or could not hear him.
 How had she gotten up there?
 The branches were way beyond reach.
 Of course, she was a Forest Nymph and he had seen her move in trees like a squirrel.
 Still she seemed very vulnerable high up there; he had to get to her.

Reading a regular book with the spell written down and trying to keep all the symbols and shapes just right in your head even as you fill the complex shape with power requires years to learn.
 But a powerful Grimoire can quickly show you the shape and help you learn new spells in weeks, instead of years.
 ‚ÄúAlso, sorcerers, like all people, learn in different ways.
 Some can quickly grasp a written idea where others will struggle to learn from a book.
 Or, a magician who is also a gifted musician will understand the flow and pace of the spell much better, like a piece of music.
 The most powerful Grimoires have had multiple users who are very different in their learning styles.
 Books like these will allow you not to just learn the spells the best way for you, but in a much deeper, complex way.
 Spells learned this way can be much more powerful than spells learned from either a regular book or the oral traditions.‚Äù ‚ÄúHow powerful and complex do you think the books we have are?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 Imeralda smiled and seemed hesitant before saying, ‚ÄúI have no idea.
 I have touched Grimoires, but I have never been allowed to read one before.‚Äù ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù Rodregas answered in surprise.

He listened quietly, and hearing nothing, he set the trunk down and quietly walked down the stairs.
 The next floor housed the laboratory.
 The door was locked and he did not want to break it down until he was sure everyone had left.
 The next floor down was the main floor; He stepped out to the main hall and listened.
 He heard nothing but his stomach rumble; he was very hungry and knew that he should eat.
 He was already in the main hall; the room to the right was the kitchen.
 He stepped into the kitchen but then came to a sudden stop.
 Standing next to one of the sinks was a very old, very dirty kitchen drudge slowly peeling a potato.
 She looked up at him in surprise, and with a hint of fear.
 Rodregas raised his hand up in a peaceful motion.

 Somewhat dazed, she went to her room, only to find that she'd left her key in Rick's room.

He seemed to defy gravity as he hung in the air.
 Rodregas tried to reach out to push Ravenhurr into the circle, but before his hand touched the sorcerer, Ravenhurr lost his balance and fell into the circle.
 The moment that Ravenhurr crossed into the circle he started to burn.
 His body twisted in pain as he burned the same blue fire of creation that he had called forth to rip apart a man‚Äôs soul and steal the physical essence of a Celestial Lion.
 The flames that he had called forth to steal the AElfin maiden‚Äôs magical abilities now burned him.
 The timing had been near impossible.
 The spell calling forth the flames of creation could only burn one life.
 But the timing was perfect; Ravenhurr called forth the fire, and then he was in it.
 The flames consumed his body in seconds, and flaring from the circle went the multi-colored energy of his magic, the one element that the circle was designed to protect from the flames.
 His magic power shot out of the circle and started orbiting the larger circle.

Watching Jasmin twirl through moves that seemed to be a modification of East Coast Swing, it was hard to believe anyone so self-possessed could've had that kind of childhood.
 I thought about asking for more details, but it felt wrong, like reading someone else's e-mail.
 Besides, I was pretty sure Rachel would tell me it was Jasmin's story, and I'd just have to go to her with my questions.
 The music picked up slightly, and Jasmin and Alec sped up with it.
 They were moving so quickly now it almost seemed they were better than Isaac and Jessica.
 A quick visual search laid that question to rest though.
 I could just make out Isaac's towering form across the pavilion in the corner where they'd apparently gone to find room for some of their more impressive moves.
 It seemed amazing to me that they were willing to move so quickly around normal, uninformed humans, but apparently they figured professional dancers were at least as quick.
 I shook my head and turned back to Rachel, only to feel my throat constrict as I saw Britney.
 Not only was she wearing a tight, black dress that made her look at least twice as hot as me, she also happened to be draped across Brandon's arm.

It was too much to hope it would actually drop to the low seventies, even when December came around.
 I made it down the lane and then started worrying.
 It was like I couldn't win.
 If Britney drove all the way out here and I was already gone because I'd taken the bus, she was going to be really mad.
 On the other hand, if she didn't show, I had no other way to get to school, and Mom would freak out.
 Part of the reason she felt like she could be gone so much ever since the accident was the fact that I always did the responsible thing.
 If she started thinking I was cutting class, she was going be furious.
 It would be like I was behaving irresponsibly and taking away her ability to pursue her art, all at the same time.
 It was past time for the bus to arrive, and she still wasn't here.
 A car zipped around the corner driving way too fast, just like Britney always did, but it wasn't white.

He'd obviously fled his own room to avoid talking to me when I finally woke up.
 Donovan's gentle knock and appearance at the door pulled me up short before I could really get going on the self-loathing.
 "Good morning Mistress Paige, I hope you slept well."
 He limped into the room with his odd, somehow graceful lurch, and then set down a tray filled with eggs, French toast, orange juice and everything else you'd expect if you were to go to IHOP and order their 'everything but the kitchen sink' special.
 While I was still trying to catalog everything on the tray, Donovan laid out a full set of clothes, everything either in unopened manufacturer's plastic bags, or with price tags still attached.
 "Mistress Rachel thought you might desire a change of clothes seeing as how Master Alec carried you off without providing proper time for you to pack your things.
 I pray though that you not think too harshly of him.
 It was he who prepared your breakfast.
 A small act of atonement, but still a start nonetheless."
 It was all so surprising that it took me a moment to find my voice.

I wanted to go to sleep long before dark, but couldn't justify it, so I just kept grinding along.
 I'd long ago learned that changing subjects and studying something new was almost as good as a break, so I swapped out books on a regular basis, and persevered despite increasingly-frequent head bobs.
 The attack came as a complete surprise.
 One moment I was quietly studying, an instant later hordes of shape shifters were pouring into the mansion.
 Most of them looked just like Simon and Nathanial, pony-sized wolves moving with blinding speed as they tore through doors and raced down halls.
 Brandon came in immediately behind the first batch of wolves.
 There was no way I could've known that the gray monster who casually sliced through walls and two-by-fours with his wickedly curved claws was Brandon, but I was somehow certain.
 He was built just like Alec had been Friday night, only so much bigger that he had to crouch forward to avoid hitting his head on the unusually high ceilings.
 Donovan faced off against one of the first wolves, but it was obvious he was no match for the grace and power of his opponent.
 The gentle, aging butler was knocked to the ground between one heartbeat and the next.

Brandon looked at my white knuckles and laughed.
 "Don't worry, nobody's going to make you drink, and we've never been busted by the cops.
 We'll have you safely back home sometime early tomorrow morning, and your mom will never have the slightest idea you went to such a wild gathering."
 As far as reassurance went, it was a pretty lame attempt, but somehow it didn't sound so feeble when it was Brandon saying it.
 I calmed down enough to marvel at the amount of other baggage Vincent dragged out of the house, and then any chance I might have had to back out vanished as Brandon picked me up and deposited me on the tailgate of Vincent's truck.
 "Riding in the back, isn't that illegal?"
 The high-maintenance blonde Vincent was helping up next to me rolled her eyes.
 "Please."
 Brandon helped a couple of late arrivals into the pickup, and then closed the tailgate.
 I half thought he was going to ride up front in the crowded cab, but he instead cleared the sides of the truck in a jump that was almost inhumanly graceful.

I suppose some people would have been thrilled by the chance to join the top of the social food chain, but it mostly just disgusted me.
 I politely rebuffed the scavengers, ignored the haters, and carefully acknowledged the rest without giving them anything else to go on.
 It was a rather depressing exercise.
 By the time Mrs. Sorenson had fired a couple of ridiculously obscure questions at me, I found the good feelings I'd managed to carry away from the mayor's visit the night before had pretty much evaporated.

 The substitute teacher sitting at his desk didn't even take roll; he just shut the door, told us to keep it down, and flipped open a magazine.
 While I was sitting at my desk wondering what to do with the next hour of my life, something I'd read in the physics book suddenly clicked.
 In a perfect world I would've been left in peace to finish reasoning out the answer.

 "No, she doesn't play anymore.

 His expression was so serious now that I almost stopped him before he could continue.
 "She stopped when she realized that 'Welcoming' was the only celebration of childbirth mother was going to write."
 I felt my smile sour, and tried to turn away, but Alec caught my chin and gently pulled my face up, forcing me to meet his gaze.

Finally Emily opened her mouth and said, ‚ÄúWhat are you thinking about?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù The question had caught me by complete surprise.
 ‚ÄúWhat are you thinking about?‚Äù she repeated.

We rode past a waterfall, the roar of water making me curious.
 I figured Ruby was my best bet.
 Chevelle gave me no answers and though hers were sometimes cryptic, I knew she‚Äôd been reading books on magic.
 ‚ÄúRuby, is there a way to harness the power of things‚Ä¶ like that waterfall?‚Äù Grey glanced at me.
 The look of concern for my intelligence was not exactly uncommon, but it was something I could never quite get used to.
 ‚ÄúNot that I know of,‚Äù she said.
 She got her mischievous grin then.
 ‚ÄúThough I did read once that there was a way to steal life force and use it for yourself.‚Äù Chevelle shot her a stern rebuke from the front of the pack.
 She continued as if excusing herself, ‚ÄúBut it was merely a fairy‚Äôs tale and probably not entirely accurate.‚Äù Then, in a lower voice, ‚ÄúIt is fun to speculate, though.‚Äù I wiped at my cheek to clear the dampness from the mist, mirroring her low tone as I questioned her.
 ‚ÄúHow would you steal life force?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, like I said, probably not accurate‚Ä¶ but you would have to take the other‚Äôs life in order to gain their power.

Over the past five decades, global GDP has multiplied seven-fold.
 In spite of unprecedented population growth, per capita income has more than tripled.
 Between 1965 and 1985, real per capita consumption in the developing world rose by 70 per cent.
 Despite the paramount concern raised by the persis tence of high rates of unemployment in recent years, available data do not confirm a long-term trend towards rising rates of global unemployment.
 Prognosis for Employment in the Twenty-First Century
 Although it is difficult to make reliable employment projections based on past trends, we can say some things with a fair degree of certainty.
 In order to provide employment for every job seeker, the world needs to create approximately one billion new jobs during the next decade.
 This will require a job growth rate of more than 4 per cent per year compared to the less than 3 per cent achieved during the 1980s.
 About 95 per cent of the growth in the world labour force over the next 35 years will take place in developing countries.
 An additional 260 million people will enter the workforce during the 1990s.

 I mentally reached around for something similar and then finally nodded.

 Mallory's sigh seemed to allude to every one of her presumably substantial years.
 "How very perceptive.
 The past is very much driving what's happening right now, but so much of the past is tied up with the very things from which Alec's trying to protect you."
 I was bubbling with questions, but sensing that now wasn't the time to push, I sat back and waited in silence while she decided exactly how much to tell me.

Several sets of boxing gloves were available and once both fighters had their gloves on, the games would begin.
 Cowering in a corner was never a good strategy as the crowd only pushed you back to the center.
 The room erupted when the action was good and the fights were a scrappy version of actual boxing.
 The fight was over when you surrendered or you were knocked out.
 I fought many times and I do not remember ever losing.
 As I said, I had grown up facing a much tougher opponent than anyone in the room.
 I was rarely injured because I had learned to protect myself from the powerful blows of my stepfather and I knew how to look for an opening and drop my opponent.
 By this time I was close to six feet tall and about 175 pounds.
 I was in great shape and I had endured physical punishment as training.

This has resulted in increasing pressure on developing countries by multilateral and bilateral aid agencies seeking to bring down military expenditure among aid-dependent countries even further.
 In doing so, it ignores the right and responsibility of these nations to provide for their own legitimate security needs at a time when no alternative mechanism exists at the international level to ensure the inviolability of their borders.
 There is truth in the claim that military spending by developing countries has increased dramatically during the past 30 years.
 This increase is partially explained by the fact that more than 100 new sovereign nations have emerged, many of which were protected, prior to independence, by the colonial powers that have now withdrawn.
 The acquisition of even modest defensive capabilities may consume a significant portion of national income when the economic base is small, as it is for many of these nations.
 In addition, the increasing incidence of war, terrorism and drug-related violence in the developing world has heightened the sense of insecurity among these countries.
 However, a closer analysis reveals that half of the military expenditure of the developing world is incurred by a small number of oil-exporting countries in the Middle East and North Africa, and another quarter is incurred by other high-income developing nations, mostly in East and South East Asia ‚Äì whereas the 84 developing nations with lower and lower-middle incomes, including such large nations as China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Bangladesh, comprising 72 per cent of the world‚Äôs population, incur roughly 6 per cent of global military expenditure, on average less than 3 per cent of the total GDP of these countries.
 International pressure for defining acceptable levels of military expenditure and reducing defence budgets is entirely warranted, provided that it is applied equitably to all countries, takes into account the varying conditions between regions and nations, and places corresponding limitations on arms exports by industrialized nations.
 Placed under the control of an impartial international agency specialized in security issues, rather than being left to development banks or made an instrument of bilateral policy by donor nations, these measures could effect a further 50 to 75 per cent cut in global defence spending and thereby generate $400 billion to $600 billion per year for non-military purposes, equal to roughly ten times current levels of overseas development assistance.
 The international community should commit itself to a minimum goal of reducing global military expenditure to $400 billion (in 1992 constant dollars) by 2000 AD.

He rested his body against the tree, trying not to tense up, and breathed deep and slow.
 Quicker than he thought, Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs black bow came up and he started to shoot.
 The Black Yew bows were an incredible advantage, they had been the pride of Raven Keep and were among the most dangerous and rare weapons that the Nymphs used to protect themselves.
 Those bows had primarily been ornamental trophies for Ravenhurr; Rodregas thought that they symbolized a previous victory.
 Only a few of the guards would have had the power to use them and Ravenhurr kept guards with even small power away from the keep.
 Against the leather armor of the slavers there would be no defense, even if they had shields; the arrows would likely blast through anything they had.
 Of course, against the Immortalist guards it was a different matter; their armor would stop the arrows.
 And, of course, their weapons would be equally effective against his armor, going through it like butter and into his flesh if he was not fast enough.
 Depending on their sigils, they were likely to be either faster or stronger or both.
 But Rodregas‚Äô short swords would not cut their armor.

Large gray rocks dotted the landscape.
 There was a haziness on the horizon but as we rode it began to clear, revealing a mammoth lake ahead.

 Besides, even if I were to develop a gift this instant, most of them require practice to master, and I'm not going to have a chance to do any of that."
 "I'm sorry.

The flame surrounding the skulls flared even brighter, but beneath their tails trailed long threads of silver.
 When Qurrah looked up, he saw hundreds of the threads twisting and curling together, coiling toward a hidden presence deep within the orc army.

 Two small intricate waterfalls softly trickled down each side wall to the, providing a soft soothing sound.
 The back of the room was an archway leading to the terrace, overhead the incredible crystal ceiling let in the natural daylight of the late afternoon sun and would illuminate the top of the tower under its own power during the night.
 In the middle of the room was an enameled silver table set for two, with Taiga lounging in his throne like chair on the opposite side of Van‚Äôdret.
 Van‚Äôdret hurried forward and fell to his knees with his head lowered; he did not say a word until after Taiga spoke.

 This was highlighted by the similarly colored silk toga he wore.

 Others believe the Sun's children marred the face of the Earth, and that when she refused to discipline her wayward family, the Earth swore in his wrath to destroy them."

 Rodregas started to tense up, but knew that would kill any chances of hitting his next targets.
 He released the second arrow at the crouching man and the arrow hit low to the left, but he did hit the target.
 He nailed the next standard target almost in the middle, but missed the last two completely.
 Rodregas was among those who were first out of this round of the tournament and spent the rest of the day watching the archery competition.
 The only relief he felt was that only one of the other winners with the yellow ribbons on their arm also gained a second one.

Inadequate job/livelihood opportunities resulting in inadequate purchasing power have now become the most important cause of endemic and hidden hunger.
 Most regrettable has been the failure to enhance the powers and strengthen reliance on effective multilateral institutions.
 The emergence of the USA as the sole superpower has brought with it a reduction in the role and influence of the UN in international affairs, precisely at a time when the world should be striving to build a viable multilateral cooperative security system.
 The Unfinished Agenda
 The Commission‚Äôs report was never intended to predict what would happen in the years to come, but rather to project what could be made to happen by a concerted, determined effort of the world community.
 The report highlighted many of the opportunities that did emerge as well as some of the dangers that have grown in intensity in the absence of effective action.
 The events of the past 15 years may not have followed the course predicted by either the optimists or the pessimists, but they certainly confirm that this has been a period of unprecedented opportunity for rapid progress ‚Äì what Sri Aurobindo termed an ‚ÄúHour of God‚Äù.
 While the gains have been significant, all of us will acknowledge that we have not taken full advantage of this opportunity to build a better world.
 Though great dangers have receded, old and new threats still loom large, demanding courageous action.
 The door remains ajar.

What I didn‚Äôt expect was their response.
 The throne room was full.
 And not one of them did not gasp when comprehension hit.
 But my father, and each of those present, seemed‚Ä¶ pleased when they saw me.
 They had no idea there was a‚Ä¶ human‚Ä¶ growing in the belly my hands now cradled.
 I listened as their voices began, and then rose, clamorously discussing the news and what it could bring.
 I cringed as their words turned to the possibilities, the power I might pass down, the strength the new one might bring.
 ‚ÄúWe will leave at daybreak,‚Äù Grey informed Ruby as I read.
 Perfect.
 The news brought on nothing but worry, so I went back to the book.

Wondering if Rick had heard her, she glanced over at him.
 He hadn't moved.
 Raising her head, she leaned a little closer to him.
 He was asleep!
 She lay there for a few more minutes, but she was too restless to keep lying still, especially with no one to talk to.
 So at last she jumped up and ran into the waves.
 Rick woke up slowly with no idea of how long he'd been asleep.
 It had been an exhausting week, and he'd gotten less sleep than usual.
 Of course, he'd had much more fun than usual too, he thought with a lazy smile.
 He turned to see if Marie was asleep.

Then, as if on cue, the dragon tucked its great wings over us, blocking out the sky and we began to really fall.
 I screamed louder and sunk deeper into Seth, trying to forget that we were falling at about 90 miles per hour without a parachute.
 Every second felt like an hour.
 I squeezed my eyes in an effort to make it all go away.
 Make it stop, make it stop‚Ä¶ Seth gave me a comforting squeeze but it didn‚Äôt help.
 I tried to think of something else, like penguins or llamas.
 Anything, I didn‚Äôt care what I thought about, it could be underwear, as long as I wasn‚Äôt thinking about what was actually happening to me right now.
 Llamas, I thought urgently.
 Llamas are furry and they spit at you when they‚Äôre mad.

Sometime during the night it must have rained and young squires had raked the sands.
 The final competition of the tournament was a true melee.
 Only the top ten finishers qualified.
 There was no taking turns.
 The ten were spread out in a circle.
 In the center of the arena was a shield painted with the seal of the knighthood, a winged sword in the clouds.
 The squire who claimed that shield and made it to the Cathedral‚Äôs main hall with it would be knighted on the spot by the Knight Commander of the Order.
 This day would decide Rodregas‚Äô fate.
 It was likely to end in defeat.
 He stood flexing his sore shoulders, waiting for the flag to drop.

Massive rock formations loomed over us, loose stones underfoot causing the horses to stumble.
 The haze was so thick I couldn‚Äôt see anything but the riders in front of me.
 I only knew from the strain on my legs we were heading up, climbing higher into the gray sky and biting wind.
 Chevelle rode beside me through the day.
 When we stopped for the evening, he pulled me down from my horse and stayed near as we sat on large stones around a fire.
 Ruby was telling stories again and everyone gave her their full attention‚Ä¶ everyone but us.
 ‚ÄúHow do you feel?‚Äù he asked.
 I shrugged.
 ‚ÄúFine, I guess.‚Äù He seemed unusually concerned.

 He drew his swords and gave chase.
 Qurrah waited until Harruq was around the corner before taking out one of his small glass vials.
 Before he could pull the cork off the top, he heard a voice speak.
 ‚ÄúSo many dead by your hands yet a single arrow nearly takes your life?‚Äù
 The half-orc froze, the vial clutched in his hands.
 An elf emerged from behind the building, his body decorated in a brilliant green cloak and silvery armor.
 It was the same elf who had fired the first warning shot to Antonil before the entire battle had begun.

 It was all so surprising that it took me a moment to find my voice.
 "Thank you, Donovan.
 Have I slept in too long?"
 A gentle smile met my inquiry.
 "Those of us who don't require normal amounts of sleep have all been up for quite some time, with the exception of Master Alec, who remained abed for an uncharacteristic length of time, but the rest of the house is just now waking.
 In fact I rather suspect you have just enough time to shower and eat before Mistress Rachel will be pounding on the door, as it were, in excitement for your upcoming trip into town."
 A groan escaped me despite my best efforts.
 Donovan was too polite to ask outright, but I had to respond to his raised eyebrow or he might think I didn't want to talk to Rachel.
 "I'm sorry, Donovan, it's just that I¬†really¬†hate shopping."

Brandon needs to have the strength and desire to embrace his new healthy body and see the ramifications of destroying himself and his family if he chooses to return to drugs.
 About the Author Bradley V. DeHaven is a Financial Planner in Sacramento, California, a husband, and a father of two sons, one of whom is a recovering Oxycontin addict.
 Brad is pictured here with Brandon in January 2011; Brandon, age 25, is 55 pounds heavier than the 130 pounds his 6‚Äô2‚Äù body weighed when he entered rehab.
 Brandon still fights the demons that call to him in his darkest moments.
 Prescription drug abuse is an epidemic which claims the lives of our youth.
 photo by Devin DeHaven, 2011
 I hope that this book and the website http://www.rxdrugaddict.comcan help addicts better understand that they are not just destroying themselves but also their family and friends.
 I hope they can see that they could have long and productive lives if they chose to feel life instead of numbing it.
 I also hope this can help people to think about their defining moments and to never give up on their addicted loved ones.
 Expecting someone to just stop being addicted is as absurd as asking someone to stop having cancer.

Agenda Item Three: Confront Brandon directly with an intervention.
 The family intervention included me, Bryce, Harry, Anabel, Lisa and even the arresting officer, Denny White, via phone.
 The intervention started with the assumption that Brandon was currently detoxing (for the second time) with us at home, and there were expectations everyone had of him.
 Brandon was attacked by all sides; the room was heated with Brandon‚Äôs denial and lies.
 He lied and denied because that is what drug addicts do.
 Brandon was mistaken thinking that he was smarter than everyone else because while he was the dealer, other people‚Äîaddicts‚Äîhung on his every word as though he was speaking gospel.
 The person dishing out the drugs rambles stupidly and thinks his admirers should be carving his wise words in a stone tablet.
 Been there, seen that with Thomas and others!
 We had been giving him regular drug tests, which showed levels of positive, and that line had been starting to drop.
 It seemed to be leaving his system‚Äî it took a while to be completely clean.

Depending on their sigils, they were likely to be either faster or stronger or both.
 But Rodregas‚Äô short swords would not cut their armor.
 It put them at an extreme disadvantage.
 As the arrows flew over his head, he became aware of the other disadvantage of bows.
 They were dealing with a limited supply of arrows; once the arrows where all shot, they lost their main advantage.
 Rodregas heard the noise of the first soldier to rush from the road; he went low and swung hard.
 Rodregas hit knee high and the man trying to run by went flying head first into the dirt.
 Rodregas knew from the feel of the blow that his sword had hit armor and bounced off.
 It was an Immortal Guard.
 Doi‚Äôvan shot another arrow almost straight down into the back of the neck of the downed guard.

The large attacker was big and powerful, but his rake had shattered and Rodregas had his short swords on his harness.
 His attacker appeared to not have a back up weapon.
 Then a voice rang out, ‚ÄúStop, STOP, it is not him!
 It is not the Sorcerer Ravenhurr.‚Äù It was a woman‚Äôs voice.
 Then a much deeper voice, one that seemed half growl, responded, ‚ÄúShe is right.
 This is no sorcerer we fight.‚Äù The voice was from his present combatant, the only one who had proven to be dangerous to him.
 ‚ÄúShe is right,‚Äù Rodregas said, ‚ÄúI am not Ravenhurr.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know that,‚Äù challenged another voice from the dark.
 As he stepped forward he recognized the shape of the large aggressive man that Rodregas had first thought was the leader.
 ‚ÄúIf he is not Gerald, then he must be Ravenhurr.‚Äù There was a silent response to that statement, but finally one of the other men lit a torch and held it up.
 Rodregas quickly realized that in front of him were five of the eight prisoners who had been held in the dungeon.

You are strongest when you are together, but don‚Äôt let yourselves be separated.
 Kojas had separated us because he already knew that.
 The girl had warned us for a reason.
 She had known that Kojas was going to try to split us up into groups so that we would be weak.
 I watched Seth pace back and forth, nervously running his fingers through his hair and drumming the hilt of his sword.
 I can also tell you to be careful about Kojas; he's tricky and will use your emotions against you.
 He'll find a way to get you to come to him instead of him coming to you.
 The girl had told us more than we had thought.
 Maybe Kojas thought we would both imagine that he did something to the other two so that we would come running to him.
 I had a feeling that Emily and Jason were okay and just as confused as us.

At sixteen years old Brandon was helping his young friend with everything from carrying him into a car or up the stairs to helping him on the toilet or into a bath.
 They would race down our hallway in the wheelchair laughing and carrying on like nothing was amiss.
 Often Tom‚Äôs father called to ask if Brandon could come over to help his son through his darker depressed moments and we would always allow it, no matter what time of the day or night.
 I was so impressed by Brandon‚Äôs mature behavior and his unwavering friendship and love for Tom.
 One day Tom‚Äôs father called me to thank me for Brandon‚Äôs friendship to his son.
 He was emotional when he called as he told me that long after the fundraisers, gatherings and phone calls for his son had stopped, only one friend was still calling and visiting and it was Brandon.
 I was so very proud of him.
 One evening, less than a year later, Brandon cancelled a night out with his friends, including Tom.
 He didn't feel like going out.
 His wheelchair-bound friend went anyway.

Improved methods of cultivation have converted food shortages into abundance or surplus in many countries which until recently suffered from chronic hunger.
 Advanced production technologies have made accessible to greater numbers the comforts and conveniences that until recently were exclusively in the purview of the √©lite.
 Vast sections in developing countries now have access to wristwatches, bicycles, televisions, travel, houses and motor vehicles of all descriptions.
 Although China produced only 178,000 refrigerators between 1949 and 1979, production has now soared to the highest level in the world to meet the surging demand.
 More than 39 million house holds, representing 56 per cent of all urban households, have acquired them in the last fifteen years.
 Similarly, between 1981 and 1990 India‚Äôs production of televisions rose more than ten-fold from 450,000 per year to 4.8 million.
 Exposure to lifestyles elsewhere through the media, cinema and travel has created greater awareness of possibilities and generated higher hopes.
 The enormous recent achievements of East Asian countries, which are quickly closing the economic gap that separates them from the wealthiest nations, act as a constant reminder and goad to those who have achieved less.
 In the new atmosphere of peace and greater freedom brought about by the end of the Cold War, all these factors combine to add urgency and intensity to the aspirations of the lower and middle classes everywhere.
 Not long ago most people expected to end their lives in the same place and largely in the same position as they and their predecessors began.

He of course remained frustratingly calm, even when we hit a bump with enough force to nearly send everyone flying out of the bed.
 The other girls were trying hard to appear nonplussed.

 There were already at least thirty people here, and based on the clouds of dust I could now see coming from where we'd just been, there were more people still on their way.
 Brandon nimbly jumped out of the truck bed, and then helped me down to the ground as Vincent came back and manhandled one of the kegs to the edge of the tailgate and tapped it.

The most powerful Grimoires have had multiple users who are very different in their learning styles.
 Books like these will allow you not to just learn the spells the best way for you, but in a much deeper, complex way.
 Spells learned this way can be much more powerful than spells learned from either a regular book or the oral traditions.‚Äù ‚ÄúHow powerful and complex do you think the books we have are?‚Äù Rodregas asked.

Soft light came from dozens of floating lamps that'd been placed in the pool, all of which gave off an aching, white luminescence that seemed perfectly matched to the brilliant white of the rose petals scattered over the surface of the water.
 It wasn't until we got closer that I could make out the purple edging to the petals.
 "Lagrimas."
 Alec's voice was husky.
 "Nothing else would be appropriate.
 Not for you, not tonight."
 As we continued forward I was able to make out the other additions to the grotto.
 The hundreds of petals had been joined by a dozen of their potted sisters.
 Their rich, heavenly scent filled the air from scores of perfect, tall buds, and I found myself leaning forward slightly in Alec's arms in an effort to capture more of its essence.
 Alec circled the pool and then stopped before a wooden easel that'd escaped my notice.

The true constraints are not material, but psychological and social.
 Recognizing the real barriers will help us overcome them.
 Human beings are our most creative, productive and precious resource.
 Human capacity increases the more it is drawn upon.
 It can never be exhausted.
 Developing the human resource should be the centrepiece of all development strategy.
 We can solve today‚Äôs most pressing problems if we adopt a total approach which takes into account all the interrelated factors ‚Äì political, economic, technological, social and environmental ‚Äì rather than relying on partial strategies.
 Partial remedies, however welcome or desirable, can always generate side-effects ‚Äì such as the increase in social tensions and violence observed when increasing political and social freedom are not matched by increasing economic opportunity, or the rise in unemployment and arms exports that accompany a reduction in defence expenditure.
 The success of the Green Revolution was due to its integration of technological, institutional, commercial and public policy measures, while its short comings arose from its failure to integrate environmental factors, which are now being incorporated in agricultural development strategies.
 Comprehensive measures can eliminate the side-effects of partial progress.

 There are only a few stories of those people who have been adopted as Nymphs who have earned the blessing, but I have no idea what effect it will have,‚Äù she said.

We all remember the swamp troll.‚Äù Seth frowned and Jason snickered.
 Seth punched his arm.
 ‚ÄúHey don‚Äôt make me nag you about the time you almost took off my head with your throwing knifes.‚Äù Jason stopped dead and narrowed his eyes.
 ‚ÄúIt was an accident.
 I didn‚Äôt know you‚Äôd run that way.‚Äù ‚ÄúAlright, we understand that we‚Äôve all done stupid, foolish things.
 So let‚Äôs just add this accident to my list, okay?‚Äù I said quickly before the two started something.
 They nodded but shot each other smirks.
 I sighed, wondering why those two buffoons had been granted this power along, with Emily and me.
 It‚Äôs not like they weren‚Äôt foolish enough already.
 The day when it all changed was still a mystery to us.

Sex toys filled the drawers and around his bed.
 Apparently, it had been a real bohemian festival at some point, at least to the people who hung here.
 Everything was broken or ajar, apparently ransacked while Brandon was in jail.
 Nearly all of his belongings that were worth anything were stolen by the scumbags who had been his peers.
 We heard Brandon‚Äôs girlfriend, Tiffanie, was afraid to return to the house while our son was in jail and it was probably the smartest thing she had done in years.
 Brandon had accumulated flat screen TV‚Äôs, computers, stereo equipment, guns, you name it and it was all gone.
 Most of it, if not all of it was drug trade merchandise or purchased with drug sale money before his drug habit escalated to the point that his addiction was larger than he could support with his sales.
 The area under the rental house had been dug out and reinforced to grow indoor marijuana.
 It resembled an escape tunnel from a prison movie.
 None of this was intended for the eyes of a parent.

And I got my uke taken from me and a call was made to my parents.
 My mom hit the roof‚Äîshe was the kind that got embarrassed by such things and that, to her, was the ultimate disgrace, to be shown up in front of other grownups.
 My mom threatened to smash my uke and Dad had to cool her down and, I think, it was later that night I got it back.
 I started right in, learning new songs.
 Thinking up new songs.
 I had this record player, you know, with the lid and the swivel arm made of plastic, and a stack of 45s, some I bought at Corondolet in a sealed stack‚Äîyou know?
 Five 45s for $1, and you could only see the top one.
 And it would be something halfway tempting, some Jerry Lee or The Cascades.
 But the others were groups you‚Äôd never heard of.
 But, that didn‚Äôt matter to me.

 Aurelia seemed impressed enough with his progress, and they soon began working on simple words further into the book.
 ‚ÄúWhy does your brother speak so strangely,‚Äù she asked once they were done, trying to broach the subject casually.
 She sat stretched out on the grass, her legs crossed and her weight leaning back on her arms.
 The whole time they had taught she had found her mind wandering to the sick, spidery voice Qurrah spoke in, a voice that had nearly spoiled his otherwise surprising charm.
 ‚ÄúQurrah was sold to a necromancer.
 I told you that, right?‚Äù
 Aurelia nodded.

 In his hand remained a long black whip that curled about as if alive.

 I already felt myself starting to drift away.
 Even the feeling of him caressing my check again wasn't enough to bring me all the way back to full alertness.
 "Somehow that all changed after you arrived.
 Little by little I started to realize just how empty my life really was.
 I wish I could come right out and say it while you're awake.

 Part of me wanted to scream for joy, to jump up out of my bed and wrap myself around Alec as tightly as I could, but I was just too far gone.
 I half thought I was dreaming it all.

 He watched her face grow red.

 She held his hand in both of hers, playing with his fingers.
 "And-and it feels as good as--as good as kissing?"
 "Better.
 Much, much better."
 She grew warm imagining a pleasure greater than what he'd made her feel a few minutes ago.

 Rick shook his head as Ted left his office.
 He knew his friend meant well, but he despised fix-ups.
 The last time he'd gone to Ted and Lauri's, Lauri had spent fifteen minutes scolding him for letting his date go home alone.
 She'd been a nice enough girl, but she'd had her own car at dinner, and it would have been totally ridiculous for him to offer to drive her home.
 According to Lauri, however, Beth would have accepted the offer and returned later to get her car, just for the chance to be alone with him.
 He was glad then that he hadn't offered.
 How could he respect a woman who would do something so silly?
 Restless now, Rick began wrapping up for the day.
 He‚Äôd been a junior vice president at Ward and Lee Realty since 2008, a position that involved a great deal of paperwork.

 It was only a few pages, about a fellow who wants peace and security, so he builds a special house with no windows.
 And he decides not to include a doorway.
 Once it‚Äôs done, he can‚Äôt get out.
 In the morning, Eric read it.
 No doubt he could have told me the theme wasn‚Äôt much different from my dream of going off with Karen to a secluded cabin, or from my quitting the baseball team so I could spend afternoons alone smashing golf balls.
 But Eric rarely gave answers to questions we could solve on our own.

Surrender is the remedy, at least for panic attacks.
 Maybe for everything.
 As I pass the turnoff to my former home in Chico, I think, surrender must make perfect sense to anyone who adores God like Brother Lawrence did.
 When we are around someone we adore, our defenses cave in, because the only thing we fear, the only thing that needs defending, is the communion with the one we adore.
 If we adore God and live in His presence, we are in constant communion with the eternal, way beyond death.
 So, what‚Äôs left to fear.
 The enemy is truly us, in particular the defenses we have established between us and God.
 Vanquish our defensive selves, we are set free.
 One of the songs on my I-pod, "I Surrender All," has long been a favorite.
 I listen, I sing along, I pray the lyrics, I perform the song accompanied by my guitar.

Forty-five minutes later I'd nearly completed another two sections, and was more than ready for a breather.
 Sometime while I'd been studying, most of the kids had left.
 I hadn't expected all of them to stay until my shift started, but I'd expected more than the two or three I usually had.
 Only it didn't look like that was going to be the case.
 Apparently most of them hadn't been serious about learning the material--they'd just wanted to come to the lab, make a half-hearted attempt, and then leave secure in the knowledge that if they failed the test they could whine to their parents about how hard they'd worked.
 But Mom, I even went to the lab.
 It sort of made sense though.
 If they'd been serious about acing the test, they'd have been here every night for the last two weeks instead of trying to cram a few more morsels of knowledge into their heads at the last minute.
 Mentally shrugging at the stupidity of it all, I pulled out my Spanish and studied my vocab for a few more minutes until Mrs. Campbell came by to wish me goodbye.
 "It looks like most everyone's gone again.

 The faces of those he had killed danced before his eyes, especially the mother and her child, and the young girl holding her little sister.

After dinner they spent the evening watching TV.
 For Rick, it was almost like watching TV with a child: Marie had questions about everything.
 It was fun to watch the wonder on her face and the avid attention she gave the programs.
 "I'm afraid I'm going to have to go to bed, Marie.
 I'm worn out, and I have to get up early tomorrow," Rick told her when the movie ended at 11:30.
 "Oh."
 Tomorrow she had to get up early too.
 She had to get to the garden before the fog lifted.
 She'd had fun today, but she had to get home tomorrow.
 While she was having fun, her parents were in a panic over her.

I wandered back downstairs, more because it was cooler down there than because I had any real desire to work on homework.
 Once I was down there though, I grimly decided to open up my bag and make some progress before Mom got home.
 I pulled my feet up on the couch, leaned back against the arm and rested my Spanish book on my knees.
 I momentarily wondered if I should make myself quite so comfortable as my eyes closed.
 The doorbell came as an abrupt surprise, waking me from the nap I hadn't intended on taking.
 I'd been in one of the surreal, vivid dreams.
 It was already too distant to remember details, but I had the impression of being on a mountaintop during the day with vision so acute that I'd been able to see the individual motes of dust.

Resolving Local Conflicts: The Commission concluded that the end of the Cold War made it possible to successfully resolve problems that had resisted solution for decades, such as the many violent communal and ethnic conflicts occurring in the world.
 The near total cessation of violence in North Ireland during the past 10 years is proof that rapid progress can be made on issues involving apparently intractable communal sentiments.
 This achievement appears astounding to those who lived through the earlier decades of religious violence and until recently found it nearly impossible to imagine a mitigation of the conflict in the foreseeable future.
 We would do well to examine closely this instance to draw lessons that may aid in addressing those conflicts that continue to defy resolution.
 The most striking lesson of the Irish experience is that rapid development absorbs and dissipates the urge for violence.
 The dramatic economic advancement of the Republic of Ireland ‚Äì whose per capita GDP rose within the past 20 years from less than 60 per cent that of UK to 95 per cent in dollar terms and 130 per cent in terms of purchasing power parity ‚Äì has eliminated the disparity between Ireland and Ulster and fostered among the Irish in both countries a sense of pride, an expansion of employment opportunities, and a more focused channelling of social energies into productive activities.
 Economic growth in the region was augmented by the systematic efforts of the British government to eliminate the active discrimination against the minority Catholic population of North Ireland in housing and employment as well as the segregation of Catholic and Protestant education.
 Violence has subsided, yet a political solution still defies the policymakers, because some of the root causes of the problem buried far in the past have not yet been adequately addressed.
 A steady and concerted effort for permanent solution in Ireland will demonstrate the possibility and provide the knowledge necessary for addressing other intractable communal problems around the world.
 A comprehensive approach to a permanent solution must include social, economic, education and cultural elements.

 The fur was not as soft as it looked and was actually rough to the touch.
 Rodregas realized his hand was sinking into the skin.
 He tried to pull back but felt himself being drawn into it.
 He was being pulled physically into the panther.

No wait, I think with cats you call them prides.
 But I wonder how they see Doi‚Äôvan and me?‚Äù she asked.
 Neither Doi‚Äôvan nor Rodregas had an answer to that question.
 ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Rodregas said, ‚Äúwe need to find shelter and if they meant us harm us they would not have shown themselves.
 It‚Äôs getting dark.
 Let‚Äôs get the horses into the barn.
 If they have been tracking me since I let them out, they don‚Äôt seem to want to do any great harm.‚Äù With that Rodregas got out of the wagon and started to pull the horses into the barn.
 Their noses were flaring, and he had to pull them almost to the opening.
 As soon as they got close they both went charging in; they sensed the barn was shelter to keep them safe from the Dire Cats.
 Like the farmhouse, the barn was also built of the same impressive large cut stone.

Youth unemployment rates (aged 16‚Äì19) in the European Community average nearly 20 per cent and nearly 50 per cent of the unemployment is long-term (more than one year).
 The emerging situation poses a challenge to the European concept of the welfare state.
 Employment in Eastern Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union has been severely disrupted by the break-up of COMECON, the dissolution of the USSR and the movement of these countries from centrally planned to market economies.
 From the beginning of 1990 to March 1992, registered unemployment grew from 100,000 to over 4 million and it has continued to rise steeply since then.
 The unemployment rate for ten Eastern European countries now averages around 17 per cent.
 Recent projections indicate that jobless ness in Russia could reach 15 million persons or 18 per cent of the work-force in the near future.
 By far the most serious problem lies in the developing world, where unemployment rates average 40‚Äì50 per cent in many countries.
 In Latin America, 192 million people representing 46 per cent of the population live under the poverty line, and 22 per cent of them are considered ‚Äòextremely poor‚Äô.
 Urban unemployment is around 8 per cent, but average industrial wages in the region fell by 17.5 per cent during the 1980s and the number of workers in the lower-wage informal sector doubled.
 Although population growth has slowed, a 72 per cent increase in labour participation rates for women is causing the work force to continue to expand rapidly.

 She went to her room and put on a set of black lace underwear and a set of emerald on top of that.
 Now that she knew Rick was the key to opening the door, she wasn‚Äôt worried that clothing from 2011 would keep her from getting back.
 She wanted to wear the black dress they'd bought for their trip to Hollywood, but she put on her Egyptian-motif dress, not wanting to shock her parents.
 She tucked Rick's handkerchief into her bra--bras--and then put on the silver bracelet he'd bought her in Tijuana.
 Finally she took Davis' betrothal ring from the little porcelain dish where it had lain since the night she'd realized she couldn't marry him.
 In a few hours she'd take it off and hand it to him.
 Rick was outside her door when she opened it.

He dropped the simple pack he‚Äôd been carrying beside a tree and hunched down as he slowed his pace.
 The stance mirrored mine, and gave me pause.
 He was sneaking into this village.
 I watched as he crept around the back of a small hut, knowing that if he was hiding, I definitely didn‚Äôt want to get caught here.
 He leapt into a rear window and I followed as low and slow as I could.
 When I reached the last tree I could use for cover, I darted up against the hut and peered through a gap in the twigs that patched it together.
 They were whispering.
 ‚Äú‚Ä¶ mustn‚Äôt let them find you‚Ä¶ shouldn‚Äôt have come‚Ä¶‚Äù It was dim inside, but I caught a glimpse of a figure through the wall.
 Junnie.
 Chevelle was whispering his reply to her, and though I couldn‚Äôt quite hear, he must have given her a short account of the morning‚Äôs events.

I only caught his eyes for a few seconds before he looked away, but even his normally riveting blue eyes couldn't distract me from my inability to identify the look.
 I was used to people disliking me, ignoring me, or even occasionally liking me, but this was the first time I'd met someone who seemed to be still trying to decide what camp to join long past the time when most kids our age would have either made a decision or just decided I was weird and started ignoring me.
 Britney seemed to be getting suspicious that I wasn't really listening, so I had to make a lot of eye contact over the next few minutes.
 When I finally got a chance to look back up, Alec and his friends weren't at their table.
 Cassie caught my eye before I looked down, but she was definitely glaring.
 Not the typical I-hate-you-and-I'm-going-to-do-everything-I-can-to-smear-your-reputation-and-get-you-in-trouble-because-we're-in-high-school-and-that's-all-I can-really-do type glaring.
 Instead her eyes seemed to warn me never to go out alone at night because if she ever found me somewhere without any witnesses, they were going to have to hospitalize me.
 I felt a chill run through me, and dropped my eyes out of involuntary reflex.
 I probably would've started shaking if someone hadn't grabbed my shoulder and startled some kind of twisted cross between a shriek and a gasp out of me.
 I turned to give whoever it was a piece of my mind, but Brandon's laughing gray eyes made the words tangle up before they made it down to my tongue.

 Seth smiled at me and I felt myself blush.

 The elf who had been sitting with me was now in a fiercely protective stance in front of me.

 ‚ÄúRun, run, run!‚Äù Jeremiah shouted to a mother pulling along a young boy.
 ‚ÄúRun west, and don‚Äôt look back!‚Äù A horrible shriek of pain tore his attention past them to a circle of torches, held by the gathered defenders of the small village.
 He kissed his sword as he approached, horrified by the massacre he saw in the dim light.
 A great half-orc bore down on a strong child of thirteen that Jeremiah knew well.
 Strength in fields and spirit meant little compared to the might of a warrior conducting the dark god‚Äôs power.
 Condemnation tore through his rusted sickle, cut his arm from his body, and then hooked around, severing his ankles.
 The boy fell, dying in four pieces.
 Jeremiah knew then he would enter the golden eternity before the dawn.
 Someone swung a torch while another man thrust his short sword.

Coping with this threat is made more difficult because, more often than not, such weapons in the hands of non-state actors, especially militants and terrorists, are superior to those available to security forces and law enforcement agencies of the state, and because detection and control of their distribution pose serious problems.
 No serious efforts are being made to stop this cancerous proliferation.
 In fact, many states have actively fostered proliferation as an instrument of their own policies.
 One of the most serious consequences of this trend is the linkage between small arms proliferation and the drugs trade.
 The use of and trade in narcotics represents a menace not only to the health and well-being of individuals and societies, but also to international security.
 The scale of the problem can be judged by the reported fact that Americans, who represent five per cent of the world‚Äôs population, consume fifty per cent of the world‚Äôs cocaine.
 In Pakistan, where there were virtually no drug addicts a decade ago, it has been reported that as many as 3 per cent of the population are addicted and thrice that number use drugs frequently.
 The CIS has now been added to the traditional drugs routes emanating from the Peru‚ÄìColombia‚ÄìPanama, Pakistan‚ÄìAfghanistan, and Myanmar‚ÄìThailand‚ÄìLaos regions.
 The drugs menace is transnational in character with far-reaching implications for societal and international peace and security.
 The countries and regions which produce these drugs, and through which the trade flows, have been afflicted by endemic violence and social turbulence.

Today was the day.
 I hadn't consciously planned it when I went to bed, but circumstances were perfect.
 If I was wrong, Mom was not only home, judging by the noises filtering down the stairs, she was awake and only a few minutes away from coming downstairs.
 Even filled with the near certainty that Brandon's parents, and by extension him, were our secret benefactors, the next fifteen minutes were some of the longest in my life.
 When Brandon's Mustang finally appeared around the bend in the lane, I found myself smiling so hard my face was starting to hurt.
 Breathing silent but heartfelt thanks that Mom was in the shower and therefore couldn't hear the low rumble of the Mustang's engine, I slipped out the front door and skipped down the concrete steps.
 "I figured you were either too sick to get out of bed, or you finally decided to trust me."
 Brandon's gray eyes twinkled as he made a show of checking me over.
 "Looks like you're not sick."
 I didn't know it was possible to blush and smile at the same time.

Some still pass it by and cross themselves, hearken back to the days of divination, the days when music could save a dying nation, a nation bent on its own self-immolation.
 That was the sixties.

 That first session, so it is told, was as if energy itself had been created in that concrete empty shell, where grass pushed through the floor, straining to catch these new vibes, this new electrical Jubal.

 She didn't remember any marigolds in the garden.
 She must have been strolling around the garden for at least an hour, and it was so foggy .

 could she have wandered into the neighbors' garden by mistake?
 She retraced her steps, but everything looked even less familiar than the marigolds.
 She knew there were no white roses in their garden.
 She was sure that the house was in this direction.

It wasn't until I heard the other door swing shut that I realized James had followed us through, but he'd taken the door on the right instead of the one of the left that I'd been holding open for him.
 Wow, talk about a chauvinistic pig.
 It wasn't worth getting bent out of shape.
 I let my door swing shut, and walked over to Rachel's side so that I could see the entire parking lot.
 Empty as it was, it didn't take very long to realize Britney's little white Saturn was gone.
 "I thought you might still be here."
 The voice caught me by surprise.
 I probably would've jumped and screamed a little if I hadn't recognized it.
 Brandon was walking towards us with his characteristic casual stride, and I felt my heart speed up a little as I remembered our conversation from earlier in the day.

 She turned to reach for a tissue.
 "Please don't make me cry again."
 They went back downstairs and lay on the sofa again.
 They talked quietly until they dozed off and then awoke, talked, and fell asleep again.
 A weak light was filtering into the room when Rick opened his eyes again, his heart heavy.
 In just an hour or so, he'd lose Marie forever.
 Marie opened her eyes to find Rick gazing down at her.
 "Good morning."
 "Morning."

The rest of the kids at the table were listening just as intensely, all except for the brunette on Brandon's left who was looking in our direction.
 My face pulled back in a smile, I even brought my hand partway up in a wave before I realized I recognized her.
 It was the trendy girl from the office, and she apparently still didn't like me.
 I felt my face get even hotter, only now I was both angry and embarrassed.
 It was a relief to sink down into a chair with my back to Brandon and his friends.
 Strangely enough, Britney also being so obviously uncomfortable helped calm me down.
 "Okay, out with it, why is this such a big deal?"
 Britney shifted back and forth in her seat for a couple of seconds before leaning in to whisper.
 "It really shouldn't be a big deal, but everyone around here acts like it's taboo.

 She seemed normal enough.
 I guess a little distracted..." The chuckle I'd been waiting for surfaced, but it wasn't at all like his normal laugh.
 It was as if someone had sucked all of the joy and goodness out of the sound I'd grown to crave on a nearly subconscious level, and left a twisted shell.
 "She's definitely distracted.
 You could even say utterly disconnected from the world.
 Completely free from the present, always living in the past."
 "I don't understand how any of this ties together."

I told her this because I needed to set some restrictive boundaries; I knew I would need to work within the confines of the narcotics officers, and this would allow me to put her off, buy some time, if I needed it.

 She reached for my hands and placed them on her young firm breasts.
 It was an unexpected treat for ‚Äúan old guy with a script‚Äù.

 He closed his eyes, his hands stretched to either side.
 His fingers hooked and curled in strange ways, many times so twisted and odd that Harruq could not bear to watch them dance.
 Words spilled from the frail half-orc‚Äôs lips.
 Some were strong, demanding, while others came limping out, twisted in form and barely existing as they were meant to exist.
 The words, however, did not matter as much as the dark power rolling forth from Qurrah.
 His sheer will would determine the full strength of the spell.
 A cold wind came blasting in, seemingly from all directions.
 Faster and faster, the words poured from Qurrah‚Äôs pale lips.
 Harruq braced himself as his hair fluttered before his eyes.

Jason sighed, ‚ÄúOkay, you would say something like that.

 Right as I was about to give up and say we had the wrong place, he appeared.

Rodregas held his breath, as the cat responded with its paws by stretching out, its claws popping free with the stretch.
 They showed no signs of aggression, but just looking at the size of their claws, and then at Imeralda, made Rodregas want to jump over the Dire Cat and put his body in front of her.
 Rodregas was fully aware of how one swipe of those claws would likely kill her.
 Unlike the house cats that he was familiar with, Rodregas could see a kind of intelligence in their eyes.
 He had the feeling they both knew to be careful with a fragile mortal, and they thought it was funny that he was so worried.
 This scene repeated itself almost every night, and several times the cats also brought game they had killed into the farmyard.
 Rodregas made a point of always taking a piece of the kill, as for some reason he felt this was expected as part of their adopted group.
 Plus, it added fresh meat to their diet without the three having to go hunting.
 After awhile he started to take the presence of the Dire Cats for granted and stopped worrying about the danger.
 Several weeks later, came the first night where neither the cats nor Doi‚Äôvan were in the room.

He looked down at her, smiling.
 Her cheeks were golden and rosy, her long, dark lashes like fans against them.
 Her dark hair fell over his arm and onto the pillow, and he reached up with his free hand to caress it.
 Marie stirred, moving closer to Rick.
 She blinked and found him hovering over her.
 As she gazed up into his eyes, she felt as if she were in a dream.
 This was just like one of her fantasies.
 Except that he was wearing a shirt.
 "You fell asleep," he whispered, his face moving closer to hers.
 "Yes."

I wait silently by myself wondering if this bust will count for my son or whether there was even a bust at all.
 Over thirty minutes of silence passes and Officer White pulls up and I ready myself because I now have a million questions.
 As he gets out of his car, I begin to blurt out my questions and he tells me he must disconnect the wire before we can talk.
 I reach for my waist and pull the wire off before he can help me.
 I hold it out to him, he takes it from me and turns it off, and he says, ‚ÄúWe got them.‚Äù I am so relieved but that is only one answer to one question and I have many.
 The deal was done and I was so relieved that it was over.
 I then called my wife who was so wound up from the lack of communication over such a long period of time.
 She sobbed uncontrollably as I told her I was unharmed, headed home, the ordeal was over and we busted the drug dealers.
 A hero‚Äôs welcome awaited me, as my son was so thankful for what I had done for him.
 As I went to bed that night, my mind would not shut off and the events of that evening replayed in my head over and over again.

Everyone including combatants and those watching from wall and window responded, so that the words swirled around the arena.
 ‚ÄúTo the Order and to the Celestials!‚Äù This time the Grand Marshal seemed to look around at all the spectators until finally he nodded, satisfied.
 Without another word he strode out.
 Imeralda followed him as did all the squire‚Äôs attendants.
 It was time for the final match.
 Rodregas left his shield and mace relaxed at his side and strode over to Nordien, who stood with shield and mace at the ready.
 Instead of attacking he asked the big man, ‚ÄúSo, are people right, do you plan to serve the Immortalists if you gain the greater sigil?‚Äù The squire looked around a little confused.
 He was clearly not expecting a conversation, but no one was near enough to hear.
 ‚ÄúThe Immortalists are the true power of the realm.

The dropped torch sputtered and died.
 All the courage he could muster failed to move Jeremiah forward.
 He watched the raging warrior butcher friend after friend, so many having never seen their eighteenth winter.
 Harruq tore a neck open, punctured the same man three times, and then gutted another who had closed the distance.
 The man died after his final slash passed an inch from the half-orc‚Äôs skin.
 ‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Jeremiah said to himself.
 ‚ÄúHang it all, come on!‚Äù
 The half-orc held both swords out wide and roared at the remaining three facing him.
 When they held their ground, Jeremiah could bear the sight no more.
 He charged, screaming the cry of one expecting to die.

Even when effective in controlling direct aggression between major powers, it encouraged proxy wars and it completely ignored the security needs of countries not aligned with one bloc or another.
 This is one of the reasons why all the wars in the last forty years have taken place in developing countries.
 Taken to its extreme in the nuclear competition of the superpowers, it ‚Äòlogically‚Äô led to the astonishing doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD) as the cornerstone of national security policy.
 While there have been efforts by the West to claim ‚Äòvictory‚Äô in the Cold War and arrogate to itself the right to determine the post-war dispensation, in reality neither side won or lost, but a failed international security system was intelligently abandoned because it was extravagantly wasteful of resources, dangerously unstable and actively promoted violence in other regions.
 Failure to anticipate the future and to structure policies and instrumen talities to meet future needs has been the dominant characteristic of all previous attempts at forging an international security framework.
 Now, once again, there is a manifest tendency to forge a framework based on the supremacy of might, rather than right, and determined by the present balance of powers.
 This framework is likely to be even more tenuous and short-lived than previous compromises, because it ignores revolutionary forces that are reshaping the world for the twenty-first century.
 We now have the opportunity and responsibility to evolve a more flexible and far-sighted framework.
 This requires a fundamental shift in perspective, a new vision of global security.
 Clearly, the competitive security paradigm cannot provide a stable basis for global peace and security.

On this trip, I have attempted to deepen my understanding of the word ‚Äúadore.‚Äù Now I‚Äôm trying to do the same with some words in John‚Äôs admonition, because I feel my mind or the Spirit telling me that everything we need to know to live in goodness and beauty may be contained in those few lines.
 John tells us to ‚Äúbelieve in‚Äù the name of the Son.
 While at a glance this could be taken to mean we should simply believe that Jesus existed, it doesn‚Äôt.
 Because ‚Äúbelieve in‚Äù denotes more than credulity.
 ‚ÄúBelieve in‚Äù means to fully trust.
 And here we‚Äôre not called to believe in ‚ÄúHim‚Äù but to believe in His name.
 As ‚Äúname‚Äù in the Biblical context refers to character, John is calling us to fully trust in the character of Jesus Christ.
 When we believe in, fully trust certain people, if we have any sense, we will follow their example and not only take what advice they offer but actively seek every piece of wisdom we can wrest out of them.
 If I want to become a baseball star, I should look for a coach or mentor whose character and lessons I can believe in.
 If I believe in Mother Teresa, I should read about her and talk to those who knew her and attend to whatever I learn.

Many of the keep employees and their family members lived in Raven Town.
 Luckily for Rodregas, there was a turn off almost immediately that let him circle around the edge of town and then start heading out of the valley.
 He went north toward the town of Cruet.
 As dusk was falling there was little traffic.
 Luckily this part of the road was well cleared and open and the horses were fresh so he made headway even as it became dark.
 He pushed hard until he reached the fork that headed west up into the hills.
 It was seldom traveled by anyone except fur trappers.
 Rodregas pushed on through the night and into the sunrise of the next day until even the horse that had been Korin‚Äôs ride, which he had tied to the back of the wagon, seemed to be tired and ready for rest.
 He stopped and let the animals take a break next to a small creek.
 Rodregas was not sure what would happen when the relief guards went to the tower and found the other guards tied up, apparently by Ravenhurr himself.

The astonishing initial success of the programme can be attributed to its balance and comprehensiveness, and to the following specific features: the government's recognition that stabilization was absolutely essential to economic recovery; the widespread public support for the programme, which was in large part due to the efforts to protect weaker sections from its harshest effects; the simultaneous relaxation of controls on industry; support for a natural rather than a forced process of privatization, based on the specific circumstances of each firm rather than on ideology; continued price supports for agriculture and a minimum wage for labour, which are crucial for maintaining food supplies and social stability; and rejection of import liberalization in order to protect domestic manufacturing against a major shock during the initial period of recovery.
 Possibly the greatest strength of the Yugoslav programme is that it was of necessity conceived by people within the country rather than by foreign experts, and depended entirely on domestic resources and capabilities for its accomplishment, rather than on pleas for foreign assistance.
 Self-reliance released the creativity, generated the determination and mobilized all available resources to make the transition successful.
 It is too early to predict the eventual outcome in Yugoslavia, subject as it is to extraordinary external constraints on public policy.
 However, the initial evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that alternative approaches can and must be fashioned which are more comprehensive in scope, more balanced in implementation, more pragmatic in conception and less influenced by extreme ideological viewpoints.
 It is likely that further study of the Yugoslav model will reveal important applications not only for countries suffering from hyperinflation or the effects of radical transition, but for those carrying out more modest programmes fo economic reform.
 Recommendations for Accelerating Transition in the East
 Conditions within the 25 nations of Eastern Europe and Central Asia vary significantly enough to limit the scope for broad generalizations on strategy beyond the statement of principles presented in this chapter.
 However, there are a number of specific recommendations applicable to all or most of these countries that can be applied to accelerate the pace and ease the pain of transition.
 1.Generate consensus for the transition programme: The transition should be an expression of the will of the society for change and it should help generate greater unity and harmony within the society.

It unsettled me a little that such a simple statement could cause industrial-sized butterflies to spontaneously appear in my stomach, so I tried to push the thought out of my mind.
 I hesitantly returned Rachel's tentative smile, and then dug into my homework.
 Mrs. Campbell stopped by for a few minutes, obviously checking to make sure that I was over my aberrant behavior from yesterday.
 I got the feeling she would've liked to chat for a bit longer, but we had the predictable surge in attendance given the coming test.
 I gave her my best reassuring smile as she left, and then watched as she and the other tutors all bounced from one student to the next answering questions.
 As much as I would have liked to just call it a day, another good effort added to what I'd done earlier would put me two or maybe even three days ahead of my personal schedule.
 With a sigh of resignation I found my place on the page again, and started sorting out another set of variables.
 Forty-five minutes later I'd nearly completed another two sections, and was more than ready for a breather.
 Sometime while I'd been studying, most of the kids had left.
 I hadn't expected all of them to stay until my shift started, but I'd expected more than the two or three I usually had.

Japan‚Äôs economic growth has relied heavily on the proliferation of small rural enterprises.
 Today, 74 per cent of the Japanese workforce is employed by small and medium-sized firms.
 China created 101 million jobs between 1985 and 1991, 70 per cent in ‚Äòtownship and village enterprises‚Äô, of which nearly half are privately owned.
 In many countries, a large proportion of small enterprises are established by women and employ predominately women.
 An appropriate mix of policies focusing on access to technology, training, credit, marketing and distribution channels can substantially accelerate self-employment, particularly in the informal sector and rural areas, and among women.
 Expand services
 The service sector represents only 25 per cent of the labour force in developing countries compared with more than 67 per cent in the industrial nations.
 Contrary to common conception, services can be a major contributor to job growth even in countries at earlier stages of development.
 This sector is as amenable to stimulation by government policies as agriculture or manufacturing, and it also provides impetus for the growth of other sectors.
 Supportive policies have enabled trade, transport and other services to generate more than 50 per cent of all jobs in Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore.

But when he reached her door, he hesitated.
 Would she believe him about the article?
 She still felt loyal to that jerk, and she might not believe him.
 Especially since it was pretty obvious that he himself had something to gain by convincing her that she shouldn‚Äôt marry Davis.
 His sister had once told him that a girl usually wouldn‚Äôt even believe her best friend if she told her that her boyfriend was cheating on her.
 He went back to his office and read the article again.
 He should have shown it to Marie before he‚Äôd fallen in love with her.
 But he was afraid to tell her he‚Äôd known of her before she‚Äôd walked into the garden.
 What if she thought he‚Äôd done something to cause it?
 Marie was growing increasingly frustrated with the books she was reading.

The point is, when we're stumped, or stuck, and we ask God, if an answer comes, we had better heed it.
 Okay, I think.
 I will write about reading Brother Lawrence and this trip before the next novel or anything else gets in my way.
 And by the end, I vow, I will know better how to adore God.
 Which, for reasons I‚Äôll soon learn, turns me once again to thoughts of Eric.
 After a mile or so I‚Äôm questioning whether, on that Sunday as he walked over the hill between Sylvia's house and Kenny Niedermeyer's, Eric got handed the choice to save me and/or Billy, or to save himself.
 The only answer I receive is a maybe.
 But all I need is to recognize the long shot possibility that the dearest person I have known gave his life for me and, despite the sorrow, my heart leaps with adoration.
 For a moment on Highway 101 in Pismo Beach, I feel sure that Eric was Jesus.
 Not in full, as in a Second Coming.

Rachel's work on her behalf had resulted in a makeup job that was so incredibly understated, even us girls had a hard time detecting it.
 Her wavy brunette hair had been straightened and pulled back in what looked like an attempt to let some other girls shine for a change, but it just made her look like a goddess who'd decided to spend the night slumming.
 Given who she'd spent the last hour being surrounded by, it was no wonder Dominic was worried she was the ugly step sister.
 She needn't have worried.
 Her features were even more exotic than Jasmin's, and Rachel had chosen bright colors that made her stand out much more than usual.
 James' macho cool really was going to finally crack tonight.
 Maybe I could pull the dress off after all.
 Everyone would be so busy looking at the other three girls that they wouldn't even notice me.
 It wasn't ideal, but it was better than nothing.
 A quiet knock brought us all around to find Jessica waiting at the door, her makeup and hair partway done, a dress bag slung over her arm.

 Don‚Äôt let them breath on you, or you‚Äôll freeze to death.

 The frost beast whimpered at me, showing me the cutest eyes imaginable.

 I drew a single arrow and aimed it at its throat.
 I didn‚Äôt want to kill it, but I knew if I didn‚Äôt, it would kill me without a second thought.

The expansion is not merely horizontal.
 It also involves the emergence of higher-order, non-material needs for education, health, recreation, entertainment, environmental protection and artistic fulfilment.
 The entry of women into the workforce has substantially increased the demand for day-care and house-care services, travel, recreation, automobiles, fashion and consumer goods.
 The raising of environmental consciousness has led to a rapid proliferation of new technologies, products and services.
 A radical change in values, priorities and policies at countless points is required.
 It can only be done by the conscious initiative of government compelled by the expectations and demands of an electorate educated to understand the impact of government on economic life and the scope for increasing employment opportunities in a market economy.
 If society decides that useful jobs must be created, then they will be created.
 Full employment can be achieved by any country that has the will and determination to achieve it.
 This does not mean that every country can accomplish the goal immediately.
 Nor does it mean that governments should try to spend their way out of unemployment by creating artificial jobs for all who seek them.

The end of the Second World War marked the defeat of fascism.
 It gave birth to the United Nations, followed by the dissolution of colonial empires and freedom for more than forty subject nations.
 The end of the Cold War marks the end of a seventy-year confrontation between two opposing ideologies ‚Äì capitalist and socialist ‚Äì that reflected a more profound conflict between two fundamental aspects of human existence ‚Äì individual freedom and social responsibility.
 The posing of these two as opposite and mutually exclusive forces has for long limited our freedom of thought and action and prevented us from boldly experimenting with new ways to reconcile them.
 The peaceful termination of this confrontation has lowered the mental barriers.
 It provides us with an opportunity to synthesize these forces in a manner which balances individual freedom with collective action to eradicate the blatant manifestations of poverty, social injustice and inequity.
 Economic liberalism and rising investment in developing countries: One immediate result of this reconciliation has been the recent movement of economic liberalization spreading throughout the developing world, accompanied by the relaxation of bureaucratic constraints that impede growth.
 This trend has stimulated a dramatic increase in foreign investment in these countries, which has risen nearly six-fold during the past seven years.
 Private loans and foreign direct investment together are now approximately twice the level of total overseas development assistance.
 This investment provides additional benefit in the form of increased transfer of technology and management skills, increased access to export markets and a reduction in the cost of capital.

She blushed, pleased with his compliment.
 Deciding that the dress would be perfect with the scarab-shaped gold and turquoise choker Davis had given her for her birthday, she went to try on two other dresses.
 But now she liked the Egyptian pattern so much that the others didn't appeal to her.
 Maybe she could find a similar motif in a different color at another shop.
 Changing back into her own dress and straightening the seams on her stockings, she emerged with the blue lotus on her arm.
 "I'd like this, please," she told the saleslady, reaching into her purse.
 "I'll buy it for you, darling."
 Davis took out his wallet.
 "Thank you, but Father gave me some money."
 "Save it for something else."

Everything I'd seen substantiated Brandon's explanation, but why would Jasmin become so enamored of someone so average-looking?
 Not only that, what were the odds Ben was one of the eight males in America who would decide they weren't interested in dating the most gorgeous girl on the planet, even if she was a nut case?
 I was still trying to sort out all the pieces when Brandon fished his cell phone out of a pocket and checked the time.
 In an amazing display of herd behavior, thirty seconds later his friends had all disappeared, and he was standing to leave.
 "We should do this more often.
 I'll see you tomorrow."
 The words were innocent enough, but there was something in his eyes that made a rush of warmth shoot through me.
 Britney was so excited she could hardly speak, but I was too excited myself to feel very superior.
 I floated through my next class, and would've gone through the rest of the day the same way, if I hadn't had to share a class with Alec.
 Still, I was so happy that even Alec's giving me the cold shoulder didn't completely sour my day.

What bomb more surely mortal Than death inside of you?
 For some men die by shrapnel, And some go down in flames, But most men perish inch by inch, In play at little games.
 Sylvia helped me remember to vow I wouldn‚Äôt go down that way.
 A while ago, a woman I enjoyed hanging out with accused me of being "serious."
 I don't think it was a compliment.
 I like to laugh, hear jokes and funny songs, whack golf balls back and forth across a fairway, cheer for teams and bring pleasant news wherever I can.
 But I don't understand how we can fail to get serious when people are burning, starving, weeping and hopelessly perishing, and while deep down we know we're not all we could be, or doing all we could do.
 In that, I'm like Sylvia Curtis.

Some were strong, demanding, while others came limping out, twisted in form and barely existing as they were meant to exist.
 The words, however, did not matter as much as the dark power rolling forth from Qurrah.

 Faster and faster, the words poured from Qurrah‚Äôs pale lips.

I bowed out of our little competition even earlier than usual.
 I probably should have stayed in the game longer, should have kept answering questions until she came up with a real stumper, but I wasn't in the mood.
 Once I was safely free to let my mind wander, I couldn't think of anything other than the look on Jasmin's face.
 Even the steadily rising temperatures achieved by packing more than thirty bodies into a tiny classroom with only one door wasn't sufficient to really distract me.
 I was going to suffer once again for having stumbled into somewhere I didn't want to be.
 By the time I made it into English and sat down next to Britney, my heart felt like it was going to seize up.
 Mr. Whethers walked into class a few seconds after the bell rang, took one look at his already perspiring students, and told us all to go ahead and spend the time reading rather than worrying about trying to focus on a lecture.
 It was a nice gesture, and normally I would have appreciated it, but I'd just finished Wuthering Heights, and knew that flipping the book back open wasn't going to help distract me.
 Unwilling to spend another hour in worry, I let my thoughts drift over to another, dangerous area.
 Thinking about Brandon wasn't safe anymore.

 It almost looked like she was going to cry, which should have made me feel bad, but I was too mad to care.

 Rachel's lip trembled slightly as she finally managed to get a response out.

 They kept talking, settling into conversation.
 Steed offered Chevelle what was left of the roast and they sat, Chevelle beside me and Steed across from us.

 The evening carried on and though the conversation still held a formal tone, neither man talking of anything personal, they seemed to be getting along.
 I faded in and out of the various discussions, listening occasionally but never talking.

 Ruby remained protectively in front of me, her posture lowered, arms tensed tighter since the stranger turned his eyes on me.
 His face twisted in agony as his right arm was dislocated from its socket, leaving the limb hanging limply at the shoulder.
 I was glad I didn‚Äôt hear that sound.
 He turned back to his questioner, his mouth a grimace as the words came out, unmistakably a curse, and his other arm was wrenched from its place as well.

The fact that she chose to whisper that bit of information convinced me he was outside the open door.
 As we talked I described to her that I had a very controlling wife and two young children at home.
 I told her this because I needed to set some restrictive boundaries; I knew I would need to work within the confines of the narcotics officers, and this would allow me to put her off, buy some time, if I needed it.
 She talked with me and continued to massage my chest as she straddled my naked body.

Rodregas decided to pull his short swords from the harness on his side and, at the same time, rush in on the big guy.
 The large attacker was big and powerful, but his rake had shattered and Rodregas had his short swords on his harness.
 His attacker appeared to not have a back up weapon.
 Then a voice rang out, ‚ÄúStop, STOP, it is not him!
 It is not the Sorcerer Ravenhurr.‚Äù It was a woman‚Äôs voice.
 Then a much deeper voice, one that seemed half growl, responded, ‚ÄúShe is right.
 This is no sorcerer we fight.‚Äù The voice was from his present combatant, the only one who had proven to be dangerous to him.
 ‚ÄúShe is right,‚Äù Rodregas said, ‚ÄúI am not Ravenhurr.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know that,‚Äù challenged another voice from the dark.
 As he stepped forward he recognized the shape of the large aggressive man that Rodregas had first thought was the leader.
 ‚ÄúIf he is not Gerald, then he must be Ravenhurr.‚Äù There was a silent response to that statement, but finally one of the other men lit a torch and held it up.

This realization would be quite disconcerting were it not for the fact that we are fast approaching the time when both these persistent ills of humankind can be banished forever ‚Äì the way slavery and colonialism were banished in the past.
 The recognition that it is neither desirable nor possible to go backwards adds urgency to our efforts to move forward.
 Revolutions of the past have been partial and localized negative reactions against an existing social order, and benefited only a small part of society that, in turn, blindly resisted change.
 They resulted in war and usually much destruction.
 The revolution of rising expectations is a positive, constructive movement spreading to encompass people at all levels of all societies around the globe, and pressing for the establishment of a higher social organization that can meet the expectations of all humanity.
 But the energies liberated by this revolution have to be properly converted into an evolutionary effort for development, otherwise they will fly off in unwanted directions.
 Society must provide the conditions and opportunities for these energies to express themselves positively and constructively in pursuit of their own fulfilment.
 Education is the most essential ingredient for this transformation.
 It is a great leveller of social hierarchy.
 It has the power to transform the propensity for violent revolution into ordered evolution.

More can and must be done in the next decade to eradicate the scourge of hunger.
 The problem of water scarcity is even more pervasive and challenging.
 Studies indicate that by 2015 more than half the world‚Äôs population ‚Äì mostly in Africa, the Middle East, South Asia and Northern China ‚Äì will be living in countries that are ‚Äòwater-stressed‚Äô.
 In the developing world, more than 80 per cent of the water is utilized for agriculture, an unsustainable level that is depleting water tables, increasing soil salinity and accelerating erosion.
 Although historically water has often been a source of contention between communities, it has never been the cause of an open inter-state conflict.
 However, nearly one-half of the world‚Äôs land surface consists of river basins shared by more than one country and more than 30 nations receive more than one-third of their water from outside their borders.
 Therefore, the danger of confrontation and conflict will escalate unless concerted measures are implemented urgently.
 Water shortages occurring in combination with other sources of tension ‚Äî such as in the Middle East ‚Äî will be particularly worrisome.
 Famine remains a persistent threat precisely because the world no longer feels that threat to be severe.
 India‚Äôs last major famine occurred in Bengal in 1943 during World War II.

 I kept reading, quickly scanning for something of interest.
 My eyes caught on his name a second before my mind recognized it‚Ä¶ Chevelle Vattier.
 As I backed up to read, my shock and disbelief turned to fury before I could even finish the page.
 Chevelle Vattier had been a volunteer watcher.
 A Council spy.
 He had volunteered to watch me.
 Swift, white-hot anger flooded through me and the pages I held burst into flames.

 A full two seconds of silence passed before I realized he'd asked me why I'd come downstairs.
 "I can't sleep.
 I've been trying, but I'm too wound up to do anything but just lie there.
 I thought I'd come downstairs and talk to you instead.
 I mean, unless it's bothering you.
 You know, keeping you from patrolling or something."
 That last bit hadn't really been planned.
 I'd wanted to come downstairs and talk to him, but wouldn't have dreamt of just saying it outright.
 Maybe it was the natural high I got simply from being around him.

 Velixar pulled from within his cloak a chest the size of a small stone.
 He placed it on the grass where it shone gold in the light of the stars.
 As the two brothers watched, he whispered a few words of magic, enlarging the chest to normal size.
 ‚ÄúOver the centuries, I have gathered many items to aid those who would swear their lives to me,‚Äù Velixar said.
 The locks clicked open, the lid raised, and then he reached inside and pulled out two swords sheathed in gleaming obsidian.

 Only the truth wasn't any better than the story he'd fabricated.
 It was worse even.

 I'd had enough pity from my mom to last years.

Bad business partner, and bad best friend: My girlfriend at the time, Karen, had hidden her drug habit from me, and by the time I discovered it she had emptied our joint savings account and was screwing my ex-partner/best friend, Pete.
 They were both very addicted to cocaine and I guess they belonged together because neither one of them belonged with me.
 I went to her apartment where I caught them together.
 I beat him within an inch of his life in front of her.
 Karen and her roommate did everything they could to pull me off of him but my rage for his complete abandonment of our friendship in so many ways had escalated to the perfect storm.
 It seemed he had taken everything from me and he had been my closest friend for the last six years and I snapped.
 This was a defining moment in my life, where I began to truly understand what drugs could make you do.
 Pete and Karen later married, had a couple of kids and, in his late twenties, Pete died of a heroin overdose.
 I moved to the south side of the lake and began selling radio advertising.
 I still called Thomas in Sacramento often, as family is family, and he was about all I had left in that category and he was all I had growing up.

 The last pages were lists of clan members in order of family names.

 I had gotten so involved in the terrified man‚Äôs story and page after page of family names, I had forgotten why I was reading in the first place.
 I sighed.
 Of course, the pages with the V names were missing.
 I felt a stab of guilt for the selfishness of the thought while looking over such loss, but I waved it away and tucked the pages under my mattress.
 Lying back on the bed as I looked up at my mother‚Äôs pendant, I closed my eyes, trying to remember‚Ä¶ I could see her face.
 Her straight nose, her gentle smile.
 Her long hair waved around her shoulders, stray locks caught by the wind.

Frankly the whole play would've been better if they'd just left it off.
 Still, sitting through a song about 'ladies of the night' as my mom still called them, had seemed like a small price to pay for getting to listen to the rest of the play.
 By the middle of the song both of the oversexed boys behind me were whispering catcalls.
 I felt my ears going red.
 I wanted nothing more than to sink down into my seat and try to ignore them, but once guys got started on something like that, they never stopped.
 Some of the people around me were starting to evidence signs of annoyance, but that just spurred the hecklers on to greater heights.
 I was so worried they were going to ruin everyone's experience, that I turned around and shot them a dirty look.
 "Oh, sweetie, don't you worry, we've been aching to get our hands on you all night.
 We're saving plenty of loving for you later.

 For a second I thought we were back on the plain, but we weren't.
 The sky was blood red and a crescent moon was rising up.
 From the feeling of the air I knew we weren't underground anymore but I didn't know where we were.
 Skeleton trees were scattered to the sides.

I barely heard Seth mumbled, ‚ÄúI don't like our situation at all.‚Äù That night, I had the weirdest dream.
 I was standing on a dark cliff, the eerie moon high in the sky.
 The wind whipped at my hair, causing me to see the green strands in front of my eyes.
 The cold nipped at my cheeks and nose, which I tried to rub back to warmth.
 I stood at the edge of the cliff and gasped when I looked down.
 Underneath me, hundreds of monsters gathered around a fight.
 I couldn‚Äôt see who was fighting inside because a swamp troll blocked my view, but I knew it was brutal the way they whooped at a screech of pain.
 I wanted to close my eyes and look away, but I was so curious to see what was going on, that I couldn‚Äôt.
 The crowd parted to reveal the scariest and most hideous thing I‚Äôve ever seen.
 It must have been some type of faery because I could see long, pointed ears sticking up from the sides of its head.

 There wasn't time.
 Even if they arrived right now, someone was probably going to get hurt.
 Cassie tossed her hair and smiled, a plastic expression that bordered on a smirk.

 Britney had positioned herself so she could see Brandon.
 As a consequence, I could see Alec's entire group, and I was amazed by their reaction to Cassie's belligerence.

 For a heartbeat I thought Jasmin would launch herself at the other girl, but Alec reached over without looking, and grabbed her arm.

Eric had angered coaches for walking away from the wrestling team after he lost a match and Coach Feezer belittled him.
 The coaches believed Eric had quit out of wounded pride.
 The truth was, disappointing people wracked him with shame.
 We wanted to rejoin the teams that year.
 But until our sport came into season and we officially made the teams, we got denied privileges afforded to athletes, like assigned gym lockers.
 Since Eric still wanted to work out and wouldn‚Äôt face the world without a shower afterward, Cliff invited him to share his locker.
 Besides running the mile during track season, Cliff was second man on the cross-country team, behind Gary Hafner.
 Eric used the locker for a couple weeks before Coach Gory summoned Cliff to his office, sat him down, and asked him to explain why a new sweat suit just issued to Gary Hafner had turned up missing and gotten found in Cliff‚Äôs locker.
 Cliff maintained that he‚Äôd never even seen the sweat suit.

It had been a hard day.
 I'd....actually I wasn't sure why it'd been a hard day, but something told me I'd unconsciously been at the end of my rope just before I'd collapsed.
 Unfortunately that same thing told me I couldn't dwell here in the comforting absence, there was a very important reason for me to regain my feet.
 The void was reluctant to let me go, stripping me of memories and experiences as I fought my way free.
 By the time I was near surfacing I no longer remembered just how much I'd wanted to stay.
 Britney was pacing back and forth when I opened my eyes.
 She had her cell phone out and was looking like she wanted to dial 911, but was worried about the possible fallout.
 I was on the ground, which for some reason made me more irritable than it should have.
 Didn't she realize how hard it was to make it over to someone before collapsing like that?
 It kind of defeated the whole point if they then put you on the ground where your clothes would take their normal, instantaneous-collapse beating.

 Olga is a minimalist.
 Though plenty educated (holding a Master of City Planning degree) and able to follow a more lucrative career, she chooses to work cleaning houses.
 She shares an apartment and pays less than $400 for rent and utilities, in a pleasant neighborhood near a commercial district.
 On most of her errands, she can walk.
 When she needs to drive, she uses her 1994 Toyota Tercel.
 She tells me, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like a sacrifice.

 A person with a family needs more than I do.
 Usually what somebody needs depends upon their function.

There have been cases where development was accompanied by an authoritarian political system.
 But we have invariably seen that if the participation in the market place is not accompanied by political participation, development efforts are brought to naught by social and political instability.
 Political, economic and social development must be closely related, mutually supportive, deriving sustenance from one another.
 Once again, therefore, we see the inescapable relations governing the goals of peace, development and democratization these are the goals of the United Nations.
 The United Nations has, over the years, devoted great time and attention to the issues before the Commission on Peace and Food.
 In the research, analysis, debate, consensus-building and actual operational activities of the United Nations System, the issues of peace, develop ment and democratization have been at the forefront.
 The Members of the International Commission on Peace and Food have interacted closely with the United Nations Funds, Programmes and Specialized Agencies.
 This report brings together many of the issues which are central to the reflection on development which the United Nations is trying to encourage, leading to the World Summit on Social Development to be held in 1995.
 Boutros Boutros-Ghali Secretary General United Nations
 The report of the International Commission on Peace and Food focuses on the 'uncommon opportunities' that have arisen as the world shifts into new alignments.

I was unsure how long I‚Äôd slept.
 The house was quiet when I slipped from bed, trying not to make a sound.
 I peeked into the main room, finding Chevelle sitting against the front wall, a small window over his head.
 He leaned over, working on something in the palm of his hand, a steady scratching accompanying the movement of his wrist.
 I started forward and my boot scuffed the floor, alerting him to my presence.
 As he glanced up, he slid whatever he‚Äôd been working on into a pocket at his hip.
 It dawned on me then that the main room had only the entrance and two other doors.
 If we were staying with Ruby then the second room must be hers.
 I meant to offer Chevelle my room to sleep in, but the look on his face was so unnerving I could not stop myself from offering something else.
 ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt have to protect me.‚Äù I hoped it was true.

It is now recognized that the democratic principles of political freedom, social equality, self-determination and related human rights are inalienable and must be extended to all people everywhere.
 The second factor that naturally imposes limits on national sovereignty ‚Äì the rights of other nations and their citizens ‚Äì has also gained substantially wider acceptance, has been enshrined by international law, and has become accepted doctrine governing many facets of international relations.
 Common security against transnational threats and common prosperity for all humankind cannot be based on a 250-year-old concept of nation sovereignty.
 Over the last half century, national sovereignty has been maturing into international sovereignty.
 As the evolution of the international community proceeds towards the establishment of an effective system of world governance in one form or another, the collective rights of the international community of nations must inevitably come to be regarded as another inalienable truth, alongside individual human rights and the rights of each nation.
 The right of the nation state to self-determination has to accommodate the rights of other nations and the common shared rights of every human being.
 This approach establishes criteria for determining when claims of national sovereignty must be ignored.
 Every right is accompanied by a responsibility.
 A government that fosters external aggression or cannot contain domestic violence and civil strife, that cannot create conditions in which its people can feed themselves or even receive outside assistance, fails the test of sovereignty.
 Under these circumstances, the international community, through the UN, should have the right and accept the responsi bility to intervene appropriately.

For a moment she tried to pull away, but he kept the pressure of his finger steady and firm so she could feel his desire.
 He made his lips eager but light, not too forceful.
 He was strong and he let her feel his strength, but he also gave her plenty of leverage so that if she truly wanted to pull away she could.
 He was making his desire clear, but the decision was hers.
 He cared for her too much, and was so determined to walk the path of righteousness and he was determined to be very careful.
 A younger man would have been in a hurry.
 But Rodregas was lost in the softness of her lips, the look of her eyes, and the beauty of her spirit.
 He wished he could make this moment last forever.
 Rodregas believed that most women did not know if they were interested until a man makes his move.
 It is something instinctive; there is a single moment when either it clicks or it does not.

 I have not done this in over forty years, but I am going to start again and I would like you to join me if you would.‚Äù The two looked at Rodregas, they were very different people, but they both seemed unsure what to say to his request.
 Finally, Doi‚Äôvan nodded at Imeralda and said to Rodregas, ‚ÄúIt has been too long since I have prayed as well, it would be good for the soul.
 Please lead us in prayer.‚Äù Imeralda did not say anything, but she nodded and followed the two of them outside.
 Rodregas knelt in the grass facing the sun, the sign of the All-Father in the celestial heavens.
 He reached out and wove his fingers together; he pulled his thumbs down and opened his woven hands in the ancient symbol of opening oneself to the gods.
 ‚ÄúDear Celestials in the heavens, we open our hearts to you and we accept our duties as your warriors here in the world.
 Let your courage fill our hearts and your strength fill our arms.
 May we know the guidance of your twin children, Honor and Justice.‚Äù He then knelt down and pulled one of the two short swords from his weapon harness; he crossed his arms and laid the blade across his own upper arms.
 It was possible, only with great concentration to do this without dropping the sword or cutting himself.

Billy Graham followed, and began to speak with such gentle authority, he stopped my eyes from wandering to the neck of the babe with auburn curls.
 Billy Graham quoted from a Bible prophet, in a manner that made me feel prophesied to.
 He commanded, Learn to do well, relieve the oppressed and the fatherless, plead for the widow.
 Come now, he said, and let us reason together.
 Though our sins are as scarlet, they can be as white as snow.
 If only we‚Äôre willing and obedient, we can reap the good of the land.
 And he warned us.
 The hydrogen bomb had cast its shadowy threat of annihilation over the whole earth.
 Sooner than we imagined, the basic power of the universe would be given into the hands of mad men.
 Then, how could our planet avoid destruction?

They tossed the bloody clothes, the table, and the pieces of glass they into the fireplace and burned them.
 Harruq wrapped the body in spare blankets he found in a closet.
 ‚ÄúGrab the sword,‚Äù he said as he hoisted the dead elf onto his shoulder.
 ‚ÄúI have it,‚Äù Qurrah said, retrieving the elven blade and its dark green sheath from the floor.
 They gave one last look around.
 Everything was back in place.
 No drawers remained open or scattered, no blood stained the floor, and only the sword that used to hang above the fireplace was blatantly missing.
 ‚ÄúCome brother, the night is waning fast,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 Harruq shifted the body to a more comfortable position.

 Her voice was quiet, subdued.
 Harruq turned and tried to smile.
 ‚ÄúThere you are.
 Are you doing alright?‚Äù
 The elf shrugged.
 Her hands hugged her sides, her walnut eyes filled with worry.

He also knew that he would have to get them out of the way of the Dire Cats.
 At least that way he could also claim the black yew recurve bows.
 Rodregas walked back up the stairs and he thought that it would be a good idea to feed the beasts first, but he did not have time to grab a couple of chickens in the coop next to the kitchen.
 The sooner he was away from the keep the better.
 As Rodregas walked up to the watchtower gates he once again wore the sorcerer‚Äôs robe that Captain Poir had fetched for him, but this time he wore it outside of his armor.
 He climbed the inner stairs until he stepped into the watchtower room at the top.
 He played it bold, walked up to the staring guard and signaled him to turn around.
 Then Rodregas proceeded to gag and bind him.
 The confused guard did not even struggle.
 Next, Rodregas went to the front gate and repeated his actions with the lone guard at the gate; he then picked him up and took him to sit with his friend at the top of the gate.

It was like keeping so many secrets for her brother had made her especially sensitive to other people's secrets.
 Another few steps brought us to the door, and I held it open for Rachel to follow me outside.
 The intense heat felt like a physical blow.
 I could almost feel my pores open up in an effort to keep me from overheating.
 The sensory overload as my eyes tried to adjust to the unfiltered afternoon sun momentarily distracted me.
 It wasn't until I heard the other door swing shut that I realized James had followed us through, but he'd taken the door on the right instead of the one of the left that I'd been holding open for him.
 Wow, talk about a chauvinistic pig.
 It wasn't worth getting bent out of shape.
 I let my door swing shut, and walked over to Rachel's side so that I could see the entire parking lot.
 Empty as it was, it didn't take very long to realize Britney's little white Saturn was gone.

On the third morning Rodregas stood ready; the format was the same as the first day.
 He thought his chances were better today.
 He was used to the sword and shield.
 Rodregas stood with his chain mail over his repaired studded leather armor; a long sword and a shield, both from the dead slavers were in his hands.
 The rules were, of course, not to fight to the death.
 A knight stood in the middle of the square and would declare the winner of the match.
 Rodregas‚Äô first opponent looked like a grizzled army veteran; he had a red ribbon and a blue ribbon so he was a man of some skill.
 Rodregas knew he had to do well today or he had no chance.
 He stepped into the square.
 The sands of the ground shifted slightly under his weight as he circled his opponent.

He lay there with Imeralda's head laying on his shoulder and her body half draped on his own and half on the mattress, he was thankful that Doi‚Äôvan had clearly heard what was going on.
 Rodregas assumed he must have slept back in the barn.
 Doi‚Äôvan walking in unaware of the situation would have been very embarrassing.
 Rodregas had suggested to Imeralda that they should stop in case Doi‚Äôvan walked in, but she had shown no signs of caring and quickly took the thought away from him with her actions.
 Rodregas wanted to ask her what this encounter had meant, but he knew that while such questions were natural they were never helpful.
 Two people fresh from their first lovemaking were in no place to talk about a relationship.
 Rodregas had made a promise to the gods and though she was the most amazing woman in the world, still he would do his duty.
 He tried to find the right thing to say.
 Rodregas looked down at her with her head on his shoulder and her pile of auburn curls spread equally over both their naked bodies.
 Her long hair covered a lot of the two of them but really hid nothing.

I contacted Thomas in desperation, and he did have the connections to get my son into Narconon, a private rehab program that we couldn‚Äôt afford.
 We put the word out through some of Brandon‚Äôs friends that his Uncle Thomas could help him get into this private rehab if he wanted the help, but Brandon had to want it.
 Chapter 22: In Sight of the Bottom About a month had passed since we talked with Thomas and sent the word out to Brandon.
 Last we heard, Brandon was about 400 miles south working with a friend.
 I wondered what prison would be like for Brandon and wished he were in prison because at least we‚Äôd know where he was; he wouldn‚Äôt be a drug addict wandering the streets.
 Strange irony, that.
 Strange feeling it stirred in me, realizing that my intervention to keep Brandon out of prison could backfire so terribly.
 Before he got help now, he would need to hit rock bottom.
 Hopefully he‚Äôd survive it.
 Then, one day Thomas called.

The squires and knights universally dislike him.
 This is his third attempt to achieve knighthood and he has gotten closer each time.
 While he is the odds on favorite to achieve it this year, no one wants him to win,‚Äù she said.
 ‚ÄúI went and chatted with him,‚Äù she continued ‚Äúand he hates the Immortalists, but is rather unpleasant and needs to take a bath.
 But he is also clearly very honorable.
 And when I asked him why he wanted to be a knight‚Ä¶‚Äù she paused then added, ‚Äúhe said that some ‚ÄòInfernally damned knights‚Äô have to stand up and fight.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo you think he is a good man?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 ‚ÄúI think Geriodon is a ‚Äòholier than thou‚Äô stick in the mud, who needs to learn to bathe and not mumble when he speaks.
 And yes, he is probably one of the only men here that actually deserves knighthood.‚Äù Rodregas nodded and said, ‚ÄúWhat about Nordien?‚Äù ‚ÄúNordien is the polar opposite to Geriodon; smooth and friendly‚Ä¶ and tried to have sex with me within our first conversation, which was also the only decent thing he said during our conversation.
 He seems to really dislike Geriodon and Karun.
 He comes from a strong blood line and rich family and feels he should already be a knight and not be forced to be in the tournament.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo, why is Nordien in the tournament and not knighted?‚Äù Rodregas asked.

Only the steady pressure of Alec's arm around my waist kept me from screaming, and then I was back on my feet, and being carefully, but firmly shoved through a tangled knot of bodies.
 My shoes had never been intended to allow ankles to withstand that kind of punishment.
 Even just walking had been risky, so it wasn't a surprise when my right foot slipped, and a sharp knife of pain shot through that ankle as it collapsed under me.
 Dealing with blinding agony hadn't ever been my strong point.
 I opened my mouth to scream, only to find that no sound would come out.
 The world was still spinning, but I was oriented just enough to realize that Dominic had her hand over my mouth and nose.
 I pulled at her arm, but the effort was completely futile.
 Rising panic over not being able to breathe made me hammer at the iron bar pressing me against her, but she never looked away from whatever had captured her concentration.
 Rachel suddenly appeared off to my right, and she put her finger to her lips, and then sank all ten fingernails into Dominic's arm.
 The sudden absence of the support I'd been unconsciously using to keep weight off of my right foot resulted in tear-jerking pain as the damaged appendage touched down, but I gritted my teeth and managed to keep it down to a hiss.

 ‚ÄúYou were making funny sounds that made no sense to me.‚Äù She looked puzzled.

He forced himself to continue running.
 If he could close the gap, the bow would prove no match for his longsword.
 Another arrow struck an inch from his left foot.
 His leg was aflame, yet he continued to charge, pulling back his shield so his sword could lash out.
 But the elf was not close enough, and he was more skilled with a bow than in just firing arrows.
 He snapped the wood up, cracking Antonil across the bottom of his hand, which held firm to his blade.
 Undaunted, the elf stepped closer, ducked underneath the guard captain‚Äôs return swing, and then kicked at the arrow still lodged in his shin, finally making Antonil drop his blade.
 The elf stood, drawing an arrow as he did.
 Antonil, now lying on the ground, struggled to bring his shield over his chest.
 Part of it caught beneath his side and would not come.

I normally would've been mad, or possibly embarrassed, but it was like my feelings were wrapped in layers of cotton candy.
 If I really pushed, I could faintly feel the hard edges, but there were so many layers shrouding them.
 I just couldn't seem to muster up enough concentration to care.
 I was on autopilot now.
 I answered Britney's whispered questions without ever registering them and never once worried about whether or not I'd made sense.
 I parried Mrs. Campbell's concerned inquiries in much the same manner, probably not convincing her that I was okay, but at least persuading her to leave me alone, and then sleep-walked into the cafeteria.
 I hated the fact that I wanted Brandon to come sit down with me.
 If he did a convincing enough job pretending to like me and I tried really hard, maybe I'd believe it'd all just been my imagination.
 It'd be one less piece of my world crumbling out from under me.
 Britney slammed her tray down, but my listless gaze didn't move from the vacant corner where Brandon usually sat.

 "I want to make love to you more than I want to take my next breath.
 And if you said yes, I'd stop thinking altogether and spend all night making love to you.
 But when all I had left was my memories, I'd feel guilty that I'd taken your virginity and let you go back to 1927 with the guilt I know you'd feel.
 And-and I'd never know if maybe you were pregnant."
 The horrifying thought gripped his mind.
 "If we'd made love, you might have gotten pregnant and then gone back to 1927, and I would never have known that I had a child."

In the United States, they now account for 79 per cent of all jobs, 74 per cent of GDP, and generate a $56 billion trade surplus, compared to a $132 billion deficit for goods.
 Technological developments, such as advances in computers, telecommunications and medical technology, have played at least as great a role in the growth of the service sector as in manufacturing.
 New service jobs in banking, foreign trade, research, design and engineering, computer software, education, health, law, finance, business management, communications, transportation, media and entertainment demand higher levels of education and skills and offer higher pay.
 In 1992 the median manufacturing job in the US paid only $19 per week more than the median job in the service sector.
 The growth of technology is freeing workers from the drudgery of the production line, while providing consumers with a quality of life previously available only to the most wealthy.
 The organization of production is also a major determinant of the number of jobs created.
 The Western pattern of mass production by monolithic corporations that emerged during the first 80 years of this century is no longer the inevitable or even the obvious pattern for either industrial or developing countries in the coming decades.
 Smaller, technology-intensive firms are faster at adapting new technology, more flexible in meeting specialized customer needs and generate more skilled, better-paying jobs.
 Recent experience, such as in the Prato region of Italy, indicates that proper blending of new technologies in existing productive sectors can be utilized to preserve a geographically decentralized, small-scale pattern of production and to enable small firms to match the competitiveness of countries with much lower labour costs.
 This offers an attractive alternative for preserving the small-scale decentralized pattern of production still prevalent in developing countries and for the future development of enterprises in new industries.

Gradually public resentment and personal suffering (especially for the aged, children and new entrants to the work force) became so severe in some countries that no government could have sustained the programme without facing political upheaval or violent revolution.
 There is some truth in the argument that ‚Äòshock therapy‚Äô did not fail in Russia and other countries, because it was never actually implemented.
 At each crucial juncture either the central bank or the government pulled back from enforcing the necessary fiscal discipline.
 But it is equally true that ‚Äòshock therapy‚Äô never could have been implemented by a democratic government, when it imposed such enormous hardship on the people and generated a polarization and fragmentation of political forces within the country.
 Where similar strategies have succeeded in other parts of the world, it has usually been under authoritarian governments, such as in Chile.
 Where force is not possible, the only viable alternative is to build social consensus in support of the reform strategy.
 Ultimately, the success of the reform measures will be determined by one factor ‚Äì the extent to which the people understand, accept and are motivated to act under the new system.
 Before introducing any new measure, maximum effort should be made to communicate its purpose and nature to the people and win their understanding and approval.
 Public education is the most powerful policy instrument.
 With public opinion widely divided over the best course of action, it is necessary to win back the understanding, support and endorsement of the population for an alternative programme which the major parties and social groups can back.

3.UN development force for food deficit regions.
 The complex task of planning, managing and executing nationwide programmes to eradicate food shortages may be beyond the political, administrative and management capacities of some governments, hampered by the absence of training and experience, political instability or social strife.
 The slowest member country retards the progress of the whole world.
 The interests of global peace, political stability and basic human rights justify and may necessitate external assistance to help countries establish viable food security systems.
 In countries that are unable either to produce sufficient food or to initiate coordinated programmes to overcome present deficits, the international development force proposed earlier in this report can act in a trusteeship role to assist in designing and implementing integrated programmes to upgrade food production and distribution.
 UNDP can undertake the role of coordinating the activities of all UN agencies in this effort.
 Emphasis should be placed on sustainable production and distribution ‚Äì not just relief operations ‚Äì through the introduction of effective systems for planning, administration, education, demonstration and implementation.
 4.Model districts.
 The potential benefits of applying a resource-based, location-specific approach to agriculture can best be demonstrated by the establishment of model programmes in different agro-climatic regions.
 The models should be large enough geographically to serve as a viable index of national-level potentials and of economic and ecological sustainability.

The search for greater comfort, convenience, security and enjoyment motivates entire societies to embrace progress as their primary goal and collectively dedicate themselves to achieve it.
 The race for development has become an intense preoccupation of every nation.
 The slow pace of trial and error growth is no longer adequate to meet the rising demands of the people.
 The awakening of this compelling urge has unleashed a powerful social force for human progress.
 That force refuses to be bound by either rationality or morality.
 Revolution means to bring future results more quickly, sooner than they would come through normal evolutionary processes.
 In earlier ages, people revolted when their most basic needs were not met, when they were denied rights or oppressed.
 Today, vast sections in developing countries are stirred to action because their expectations are not fulfilled.
 Economic liberalization has unleashed people‚Äôs expectations: witness the rush of Chinese peasants to invest in the stock market and the increasing demand of Indian villagers for a range of consumer goods.
 The same movement continues in the West as increased physical and social mobility, the growing demand for higher education and the widespread urge for greater recreation and travel.

I could feel myself blushing again as I pulled free and fled into the house with a single wave goodbye.
 Normally I wasn't flirtatious.
 Heck, I hardly knew the meaning of the word, but something about Brandon turned it all into a harmless game.
 A game with rules that were nearly comprehensible for a change.
 One where there was very little to lose and an undreamed-of potential for achieving amazing things.
 As soon as the door was shut I ran to the window and hid behind the blinds, watching as the black Mustang drove up our lane.
 Overcome by the sudden urge to giggle, I ran upstairs looking for my mom.
 I made it all the way to her door before remembering the Jeep hadn't been downstairs.
 Typical.
 The one time I had good news, and she wasn't around.

 I wanted to throw up a little, but I managed to smile and hold the door open for her.
 If I made it through the next two hours without having an attack it would be a miniature miracle.
 Halfway through the walk to my normal table I looked up and saw Rachel smiling at me with almost the exact same innocent, convincing smile her brother had used on me just a couple of hours before.
 My insides simultaneously tensed up with hurt and relaxed in happiness.
 The best I could really have expected out of the experience would have been to stay on an even keel, but instead it was almost as if part of my frustration evaporated.
 I still wasn't ready to get up and sing any songs, but it was starting to at least look like I might manage to finish out the day.

It took a simple invisibility spell to approach their rundown home unnoticed, her feet moving silently because of her natural elven grace.
 It was midday and the sun was high in the sky.
 Most of the murders occurred once darkness fell, and always when the child wandered into the forest to play.
 Lately no murders had been found, and Aurelia couldn‚Äôt decide if she should be worried or hopeful that they had stopped at the same time she had begun training with Harruq.
 Aurelia peered through a gap in the boards.
 She and Harruq had finished their sparring an hour before, and she expected him to be resting.
 She was right.
 What surprised her was how Qurrah remained asleep as well.
 Dieredon had mentioned nocturnal visits between the other brother and the man in black, but she had no idea how long they lasted.
 For Qurrah to still slumber they must last for several hours, if not the entire night.

Others would tell us to rely on God indirectly, by reading and following the example of Christ and the principles he gave.
 In the Sermon on the Mount alone, Christ urges us to keep our desires in check, speak the truth, give sacrificially, set aside worries, pray, withhold judgment except about our own thoughts and actions, and ask for good gifts such as wisdom.
 Mostly to slow my whirling mind, I speak a prayer, a request I have often made, asking God to help me love better.
 And what comes is a reminder of something I've been told more than once.
 As I recall, the first time came at the University of San Diego.
 When I moved back to my hometown of San Diego from Chico, I left behind a tenured professorship.
 My two kids lived with me and cost plenty.
 So I started teaching all around.
 One semester, I taught nine classes at four colleges, about 90 hours a week, which left me too weary to write, or so I thought.
 My son Cody and I went to Tae Kwon Do classes twice a week.

She was suddenly the old Rachel I knew from school instead of the confident young woman who'd helped face down three terrifying shape shifters intent on sending me back to Brandon.
 "Are you sure, Alec?
 I could go help her get settled into the Lilac Room."
 Alec's smile was gentle.
 It reminded me of how Mom looked when I offered to take care of some especially undesirable duty she'd been procrastinating.
 "No, Mother's still the mistress of this house.
 We've waited too long as it is.
 If we don't take care of it now it may be another week or two before we have a chance, and Donovan will be severely disappointed in both of us."
 They were both smiling now, as if at some shared joke, but that didn't help defuse the sudden feeling of nervousness sweeping through me.
 Rachel followed us down a series of corridors, and then waited as Alec knocked on a plain, oak door.

Merely human eyes never could've hoped to follow all of the action.
 I got the feeling Alec's technique was superior.
 He moved from spot to spot, motion to motion with the smooth economy of a tree bending before the wind, but if he was a tree, Brandon was the hurricane.
 Flare-light reflected off of deadly claws, and blood splattered the earth as Brandon drove Alec before him.
 Gashes appeared on both leaders, wetly glistening in the green light, but they were more numerous on Alec than on Brandon.
 I expected the unseen plane to mirror the fight I was so desperately trying to track with my inferior vision.
 There should have been titanic clashes of power, ants marching up and down my skin from being far too close to ground zero, but there weren't.
 Brandon's energy beat down on Alec, beat down on all of us, but although I could feel the answering flare of power from the rest of the pack, Alec remained silent, dancing away from the worst bursts of metaphorical death at the same time he dodged Brandon's fangs.
 The flares were almost dead, but there was just enough light for me to see the smaller figure reel away from the larger as a vicious slash sank home in Alec's chest.
 Time stretched and pulled like taffy, and I had plenty of time to watch Alec fall, to feel splatters of hot liquid even standing so far away.

 For a long time, there was no sound, only those disjointed images.
 When the sound came, there was something else wrong.

He was thrilled when she didn't say she'd probably be back in 1927 before then.
 She was quiet during the ride home, remembering the scene she'd done.
 And how she'd peered through a camera.
 And sat in a director's chair as he walked his sitcom actors through a scene.
 It hadn't been a page out of a fairy tale like she'd expected, but it had been exciting nevertheless.
 And a dream-come-true.
 "I feel gritty.
 I think I'm going to jump in the shower," Rick told her when they got back to the hotel.
 "Me too."
 She would have preferred a bath, but she was afraid she'd fall asleep in the tub.

"The jacket is made out of some kind of special material."
 That was the most amazing stunt she saw that day, but there were dozens of special effects and props that filled her with wonder.
 They took a tour of the movie lot, and Marie was excited to see the sets of some of the movies Rick had rented for her.
 The tram they rode crossed a bridge that shook as if it would collapse, and she screamed, clutching Rick's arm.
 A giant shark swam up to the tram as it crossed a river, and as they later emerged from a forest, it began raining, and a flood rushed toward them.
 With so many children on the tram, Marie knew that these "disasters" were just tricks, but she was still glad she could huddle in Rick's arms when the tram seemed to be in danger.
 "You're not afraid of heights, are you, sweetheart?"
 Rick asked as they stood in line to ride the "E.T."

Rodregas heard the noise of the first soldier to rush from the road; he went low and swung hard.
 Rodregas hit knee high and the man trying to run by went flying head first into the dirt.
 Rodregas knew from the feel of the blow that his sword had hit armor and bounced off.
 It was an Immortal Guard.
 Doi‚Äôvan shot another arrow almost straight down into the back of the neck of the downed guard.
 The man thrashed once and then laid still.
 The second body flew by in a blur.
 With such swiftness, Rodregas reasoned, he must have a sigil of speed.
 He headed right for Doi‚Äôvan and was behind Rodregas before he could do anything.
 Doi‚Äôvan must have seen him coming from his position and he dropped his bow and pulled his great sword.

Besides, it gave me an excuse to try and ignore the fact that half of the people in the room seemed to be staring at me when they thought I wasn't looking.
 I finally worked up enough courage to look across the cafeteria as I peeled the label off of the can.
 Alec wasn't at his usual place, but Brandon was at his normal table, surrounded by a smaller than normal group.
 The discussion looked way more intense than normal, and seemed to center around him and Cassie.
 It was all so crazy.
 Two weeks ago my life had revolved around my inability to think of certain things without collapsing.
 That hadn't changed, but now there was a distinct possibility Jasmin was going to hurt me just to ensure I stayed silent.
 Oh, and I was actually considering opening myself up for some very nasty ridicule, just on the infinitesimally slim chance a boy who was so popular, rich, and gorgeous that he shouldn't even know my name might be interested in me.
 Life was supposed to get better as you got older, but it was starting to look like it just got more complicated.
 Just before I looked back down at the shiny aluminum of my now-naked can, Brandon looked up and caught my eye.

He was not sure if he was awake; his mind seemed heavy with dreams, and shifting images.
 It took him a long time before he remembered the battle.
 With the memory came concern for Doi‚Äôvan and Imeralda, and a surge of adrenaline that gave him the energy to try to wake up.
 Rodregas tried to sit up, but his body, which had been so strong since that day at Raven Keep, now only responded sluggishly.
 He was sleepy, but had the idea that he had been sleeping a very long time.
 Yet, his body still felt exhausted.
 Rodregas must have moved enough to get some attention because a man, or to be more accurate, an adult male Nymph, moved into his sight.
 Rodregas was always surprised by the amount of hair coming out of the ears of an adult Nymph.
 He was glad that was one trait that Imeralda did not seem to have.
 He knew the thought to be a silly one even as it crossed his mind.

 Rick, still concerned about Marie, left work at 4:30, making a quick stop to pick up a surprise for her.

Rachel reached over and gave me a hug.
 "Try not to think about it too much.
 Just remember that Alec's dominant to everyone here, and he'd die for either of us without even a heartbeat's worth of hesitation."
 After Rachel left I spent the next hour trying to get comfortable in Alec's desk chair.
 It was likely the discomfort was more due to the subject matter than the chair, but I just couldn't get comfortable.
 I finally moved my books over to the bed and sprawled out on it.
 Spanish, Math, History, Biology, English.
 The subjects all blurred together as the hours passed by in a blur of academic exhaustion.
 I wanted to go to sleep long before dark, but couldn't justify it, so I just kept grinding along.
 I'd long ago learned that changing subjects and studying something new was almost as good as a break, so I swapped out books on a regular basis, and persevered despite increasingly-frequent head bobs.

Ravenhurr had been lucky indeed.
 He had been able to buy several Dire Cats from the Immortalist Guild dealer Taiga.
 With magic, he caused them to go into heat.
 It was known to be very difficult to affect Dire beasts with magic, and his success had shown his power and accomplishment as a mage.
 Rodregas had regretted not being on duty when the Dire Cats were staked out on the roof.
 Rodregas had heard from the other guards that the cats were in heat, and as Ravenhurr had hoped, a Celestial Lion had sensed their presence while the lion was out during the full moon with the Wilde Hunt, and the great lion had spent the last few nights doing his best to impregnate both of the female beasts.
 The whole keep could hear the wild rutting going on.
 Ravenhurr then had goats released on the roof and the Celestial Lion had gorged himself on them when he had finished rutting.
 The well-satisfied beast lay limp, sleeping, confident in his celestial power, and oblivious to his surroundings.
 He lied unbound, as required by the ceremony.

 The Danger of Watching Joan of Arcadia
 In Oregon, I‚Äôm speeding alongside one of the many wide and glistening rivers and gazing across at concentric rows of emerald hills at intervals topped with lacy clouds when I catch myself admiring them to such a degree I could call it worship.
 Then something reminds me to turn from worshiping the creation to worshiping its creator.
 To adore a feeling or state of mind, such as the revelation of beauty in nature or the way a lover makes me feel, may involve nothing but selfishness.
 But to adore the creator of that feeling, God for creating nature, a lover for giving me a piece of her heart, or parents for providing warmth and safety, that is appreciation, gratitude, untainted by the selfishness that all sin is made of.

The growth of technology is freeing workers from the drudgery of the production line, while providing consumers with a quality of life previously available only to the most wealthy.
 The organization of production is also a major determinant of the number of jobs created.
 The Western pattern of mass production by monolithic corporations that emerged during the first 80 years of this century is no longer the inevitable or even the obvious pattern for either industrial or developing countries in the coming decades.
 Smaller, technology-intensive firms are faster at adapting new technology, more flexible in meeting specialized customer needs and generate more skilled, better-paying jobs.
 Recent experience, such as in the Prato region of Italy, indicates that proper blending of new technologies in existing productive sectors can be utilized to preserve a geographically decentralized, small-scale pattern of production and to enable small firms to match the competitiveness of countries with much lower labour costs.
 This offers an attractive alternative for preserving the small-scale decentralized pattern of production still prevalent in developing countries and for the future development of enterprises in new industries.
 Each advance in attitudes, lifestyles, social institutions and forms of commercial organization has ultimately expanded the scope of economic activities and raised living standards substantially.
 Jobs are created by our innate human resourcefulness and ingenuity, expressed as invention, innovation and social imitation.
 The ultimate determinant of the number and quality of jobs in future will not be physical or even financial constraints, but ‚Äì ‚Äòscience, technology, values and social organization ‚Äì in a word, the human imagination‚Äô.

‚ÄúAs I lift your sword up, so do I lift up your honor and make it mine.‚Äù As he finished the oath he handed the sword back to Doi‚Äôvan, who responded with the final, ‚ÄúMy arm shall be your arm, my sword your sword, my honor your honor.‚Äù Rodregas had expected to have to claim his followers as Oath Bond, but a knight would never have demanded to see the oath.
 He felt guilt seize his stomach at having been mistaken and knowing Doi‚Äôvan had been forced to swear the oath, due to not wanting to blow their cover.
 Rodregas swore to himself that he would lift the oath as soon as they could be free, but the fact that Doi‚Äôvan had trusted him enough to say such an oath out loud, which could put his very soul in jeopardy, was a powerful statement to their growing friendship.
 Rodregas looked back at the sorcerer who actually seemed surprised at watching the oath sworn, ‚ÄúSatisfied, Sir?‚Äù The sorcerer waved his hand and without a word went back to his chair sitting down as a king to his throne.
 The Knight Captain called for a squire, who he commanded to find them a room.
 Rodregas sensed that the Knight Captain was not happy with what had happened, but he said no word of apology.
 As the three were led away, Rodregas asked the boy the name of the sorcerer at the table.
 ‚ÄúThat is the Immortalist Van‚Äôdret, Ambassador to the Knights from the Guild.
 He is very powerful you know.
 We are told to do whatever he commands, but also told to stay as far away from him as possible,‚Äù said the young boy, who could not have been much more than twelve years old.

In fact, I realized that my whole body was aching from the strange attack I had experienced.
 And if I was dead, I wouldn‚Äôt need to breathe so heavily.
 My heart was racing so fast that it might explode right out of my chest.
 Jason threw the knife he had been holding and it stuck into a tree.
 He grinned at me and I guess it hit exactly where he wanted.
 ‚ÄúOn the count of three, we attack with everything we‚Äôve got.
 Okay?‚Äù Seth looked at Jason and I.
 We nodded at him.
 ‚ÄúOne, two three!‚Äù When Seth hit three, he charged with his sword.
 I pulled back and released my arrow.

The search for greater comfort, convenience, security and enjoyment motivates entire societies to embrace progress as their primary goal and collectively dedicate themselves to achieve it.
 The race for development has become an intense preoccupation of every nation.
 The slow pace of trial and error growth is no longer adequate to meet the rising demands of the people.
 The awakening of this compelling urge has unleashed a powerful social force for human progress.
 That force refuses to be bound by either rationality or morality.
 Revolution means to bring future results more quickly, sooner than they would come through normal evolutionary processes.
 In earlier ages, people revolted when their most basic needs were not met, when they were denied rights or oppressed.
 Today, vast sections in developing countries are stirred to action because their expectations are not fulfilled.
 Economic liberalization has unleashed people‚Äôs expectations: witness the rush of Chinese peasants to invest in the stock market and the increasing demand of Indian villagers for a range of consumer goods.
 The same movement continues in the West as increased physical and social mobility, the growing demand for higher education and the widespread urge for greater recreation and travel.

Mallory tenderly accepted the letter he produced from a pocket somewhere, and then waited while Alec knelt in front of her.
 I felt a tingle of power as Mallory reached out and placed her hands on either side of his face.
 The power surged, and Alec's heavy, cool power was joined by something light and laughing.
 Several seconds later, Mallory released Alec with a sigh and fell back in obvious exhaustion.
 Alec watched intently until she shook her head, and then the mask fell for just a second before he locked it back in place, hiding the disappointment that for the slimmest of moments had been plainly written on his expression.
 Mallory reached out, as if to take Alec's hand, but he gently set her hands back on her lap.
 "Nothing's changed.
 We'll just proceed as before.
 Rest now, and should the worst come to pass I'll send Donovan to you."
 A few seconds later Alec and I were outside the cabin, walking back in the direction of the waiting motorcycle.

Margaret had been my friend longer than anyone except my cousins.
 Since second grade.
 All through elementary school, she was always the smartest in class, and kinder than anybody else I knew.
 She spent eighth grade in my mom's English and Social Studies class.
 Later my mom called her the brightest student she ever taught.
 And her pure and soulful singing would land her, only months after high school, on a weekly television show with a folk group, The Good Time Singers.
 That summer before our senior year, Margaret's best friend was Pam Greenman, who attended our rival high school.
 Lane was someone I probably never would've befriended if not for Eric.
 Since we met in seventh grade, I had considered Lane a smart-mouthed little pest while he thought of me as a big, dumb oaf.
 In Eric's company, we each learned better.

Alec hadn't even bothered to come to Physics since the assignment had been given.
 My entire life I'd had people try and sponge off of my work, and I was way beyond sick and tired of it.
 By the time Alec strode into class looking like the inspiration for every romance novel ever written, I was really mad.
 I hardly waited for him to sit down before I pulled my desk a little closer and hissed at him.
 "So very nice of you to come to class on the day our stupid assignment is due."
 Alec's expression was remarkable in that I'd never seen anyone look so full of life while simultaneously failing to betray even the slightest hint of emotion.
 He didn't even open his mouth as he reached into his bag and pulled out a bundle of densely-packed typewritten pages.
 The arrogance of it all.
 He hadn't even bothered to consult with me before typing up an answer that was probably completely off base.
 I pulled out my shabbier, but correct, answer and mirrored his action, tossing my bundle on his desk before looking down at his report.

It would take a real heartless individual to abandon their own family.
 My anger buffered me just enough to think about Cindi without the usual consequences, but I still wasn't really in top form.
 I was halfway through my class before I realized Mr. Simms had been shooting me dark looks for the last twenty minutes.
 They weren't the obvious nasty looks that kids shoot each other of course.
 They were subtle and infrequent but there was something about the set of his mouth that made it clear he wasn't pleased I was in his class.
 I shrugged it all off and gutted my way through class, eagerly planning what I'd say to Alec when I saw him in physics, only when I finally stalked into Mrs. Alexander's class Alec wasn't sitting in his corner desk.
 I pulled out my notes and started reviewing what I'd managed to learn about our project, stalling until he arrived so I could give him a piece of my mind.
 Only he never walked through the door.
 I still had my anger, but it wasn't cushioning me as well for some reason.
 It felt like another attack was on the way.

The year my kids began to climb out of the mud, I met Pam.
 * Back when I had only one child, someone told me that two was as easy or easier than one.
 Whoever said that ought to be gagged.
 At least in my family, while one kid slept, the other wouldn‚Äôt.
 When one behaved, the other raised hell.
 Everything one gets, the other wants.
 And so on.
 (Read Mark Twain‚Äôs Roughing It to learn how this plays out in large Mormon families.)
 I told Pam one kid would be plenty for me and suggested that even the one could wait until after I had rested for a couple years from raising Darcy and Cody, who by now were adults so admirable that just thinking about them often made me glow.
 Several of my friends with grown kids had married younger women and right away gotten snipped, but I couldn‚Äôt deny Pam the experience of being a mother, knowing I might‚Äôve remained a loveless semi-zombie without Darcy and Cody.

Now though, it felt more reassuring than threatening.
 The rest of Les Mis√©rables was even better than I'd hoped.
 Minutes and seconds went by faster than at any other time in my life.
 As the curtain finally came down, I brushed away the traces of tears that'd appeared on my face during the performance, and turned in my seat as the lights came up.
 Alec was gone.
 The drapes were swaying gently as if they'd been brushed by someone moving quickly, but other than that there was no trace of him.
 It wasn't until I'd filed out into the grand foyer, eager to spend a few minutes taking in the gorgeous bronze statues liberally scattered throughout the room, that I realized why I felt so odd.
 Part of the difference was the normal sensation of having vicariously been part of something larger than life.
 My head knew all I'd done was sit motionless while performers portrayed a fictional story.
 The rest of me felt as though I had just risked life and limb, seen people I loved killed, and played a small but tangible part in altering the course of history.

Rodregas was feeling pretty good at the moment, dangerously positive.
 He had learned long ago that the better you felt, the harder came the emotional fall.
 He knew this was all too good to last, but knowing that it would not last also made it more important that he enjoy the moment.
 Rodregas was free.
 He was being hunted; but hunted because he had finally dealt out justice.
 He had killed two monsters, two who wore faces not their own, and who he could feel no remorse for killing.
 Rodregas had finally escaped to his quiet place in the mountains to rest and, best of all, with two companions who seemed to be good people.
 Clearly, Doi‚Äôvan had a dark side and he knew little of either of his companions.
 But it had been a long time since he had wanted to know more about anyone that he met.
 Rodregas had a new strong and powerful body, and he owed a great debt of guilt for that.

 She was a Forest Nymph.
 He thought he should just leave her there.

 Maybe he could have made it, but if he missed it was at least a hundred feet down.
 So he climbed the bark over to the other branch and then walked on the top, which was very easy.
 He followed Imeralda out on the branch until it started getting thin and began swaying.

 Mallory suddenly doubled over in a fit of coughing that left her white and shaking.
 I jumped to my feet and almost ran for Alec, but she grabbed my hand with more of that fragile strength, and pulled me back down.
 "There isn't anything he can do for me, child, and unless I'm very much mistaken he's more than normally worried right now.
 He's in no kind of way needing yet more to fret about.
 Just let me catch my breath and I'll be as right as ever."
 Several minutes later, once the renewed bout of coughing had subsided, Mallory looked back up at me with wan features.

Slower growth in productivity can be attributed to a slowdown in the development of improved hybrid varieties, shortages of quality seeds and fertilizers, and the absence of techno-infrastructure facilities needed for storage and processing, expansion of markets, transport and distribution.
 Environment
 A number of factors are posing serious obstacles to productivity growth and threaten even current levels of production.
 Of the poor, 80 per cent in Latin America, 60 per cent in Asia and 50 per cent in Africa live on marginal land of low productivity and high susceptibility to environmental degradation.
 Raising productivity on these lands can be extremely difficult.
 Quality farmlands are being lost at an astonishing rate to diversion for non-farm uses, desertification, deforestation, soil erosion, and the depletion and pollution of water resources.
 These factors have resulted in the degradation of nearly one billion hectares worldwide since the Second World War.
 In addition, climatic changes resulting from the increased emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere are expected to exert additional negative impact over the long term, the extent of which is difficult to assess.
 Opportunities in Agriculture
 Rapid and sustained expansion of food and agricultural production cannot be achieved without concerted efforts to address these factors.

It may have been the wisdom of the great powers to fashion this non-democratic structure and maintain it, so long as the superpowers and the military blocs stood in firm opposition to each other, and so long as military power was a primary factor in world affairs.
 Equally, it will be wisdom now to recognize that this system is no longer justifiable or tenable.
 The end of the East‚ÄìWest confrontation, the rise of economic power and economic issues to a dominant position in international relations, the proliferation of new member countries from the developing world, and, most importantly, the emergence of development along side peace as a primary mission of the UN system, are all arguments for radical change.
 The same rationale that warrants an insistence on the adoption of democratic institutions and democratic rights within all member countries also justifies their adoption by the international community.
 A system that is not truly representative will not have the credibility and cannot generate the necessary participation and cooperation required for effective action on issues of crucial importance to the whole world.
 The rule of unanimity or veto power cannot be an effective principle of governance in a world of complex and diverse interests, as the recent conflict of interests within the European Union also illustrates.
 Those nations that regard themselves as the standard bearers of democracy and human rights within nations cannot justify denying these principles between nations.
 World peace and prosperity in the coming decades will depend on our willingness boldly to confront this issue.
 At the end of the Second World War the victorious nations joined together to found the UN.
 At the end of the Cold War, the organization needs to be re-founded, and restructured according to democratic principles, to give a more active role and more equitable representation to people of all nations.

Lisa and I had been married for twenty-four years and we knew what lay ahead would be a bigger test of our commitment than what I had just done.
 We needed to help Brandon and I needed to believe this would also help the kids I was attempting to bust, just as my son getting busted was one step closer to hitting bottom, and hopefully one step closer to getting off of these powerful drugs.
 There was no turning back now.
 Before I got home from my massage, my crack-berry phone rang and it was Ashley.
 She called me to ask if I could bring her a few Oxys to hold her over for the night.
 I, of course, didn‚Äôt have any Oxys so I told her I couldn‚Äôt get out and we could do the whole deal at once.
 I couldn‚Äôt help but feel sorrow for her and guilt for what I was doing but I justified it in my mind that she needed to get away from this guy and that she needed to get help for her drug problem as well.
 I pictured my son and his willingness to do anything to get his next fix.
 When I arrived at home I called Officer White‚Äôs phone and told him I had a drug deal set up with Steve and Ashley and they wanted one hundred Oxy pills.
 To say he was shocked would be an understatement.

I finished processing everything about the time Alec turned and walked back.
 I opened my mouth to protest, but he shook his head at me as we all fell into formation around him.
 From what little I knew about Alec's pack, it wasn't uncommon for them to spend time together without the kind of chest-beating byplay that was so much a part of Brandon's group, but our lunch table was even more subdued than I'd expected.
 Faced with an almost complete lack of conversation, I didn't have the courage to ask some of the questions on my mind.
 It wasn't until I'd followed Isaac to my history class that I finally worked up the nerve to find out more of what was going on.
 Once the substitute had called roll, and then more or less turned the class loose for a 'group study session', I turned to Isaac and whispered my first question.
 "This fight between Alec and Brandon, it's for real?
 I mean they aren't just going to fight until first blood, are they?"
 Isaac's nod was hesitant, like he knew I was headed towards things he wasn't supposed to tell me.
 "I'm afraid the contest is quite serious, but still nothing for you to worry about."

 I wasn't sure my reassurance had been prompt enough, but Jasmin jumped in with a self-satisfied smile.
 "She's right, about how beautiful you look, Dom, if not about how pretty she is.
 James is going to pant when he sees you."
 Rachel had started prepping for the dance early, doing first her own makeup, and then Jasmin's while I was still gone with Alec.
 By the time I'd returned, Rachel's youthful features had taken on a mature cast that'd make all kinds of boys wish they'd taken a risk and asked Alec's little sister out.
 Jasmin had about the least reason out of any girl alive to be an expert hair dresser since her naturally wavy hair could just air dry and still look like she'd spent hours working on it, but an expert she was.
 The results of her efforts on Rachel's behalf were nothing less than spectacular, and the casual-looking knot of curls and twists was wispy in all the right places.
 Even with Rachel currently an order of magnitude hotter than normal, Jasmin still captured the prize.
 Rachel's work on her behalf had resulted in a makeup job that was so incredibly understated, even us girls had a hard time detecting it.

My hands were bandaged, as was my elbow and right calf.
 My dirty, ripped jeans and shirt had been replaced with clean clothes that were only a little too small.
 That last fact should have alarmed me more than it did.
 Somehow being stripped down by a stranger paled in comparison to a near-death hallucination involving wolves and a monster straight out of a science fiction movie.
 The bedroom was possibly the nicest room I'd ever been in.
 A movie star or millionaire would have had a hard time topping this place for sheer decadence.
 The walls were paneled in some kind of rare, doubtless expensive imported hardwood.
 The bookcases that covered the majority of the wall space seemed to be made out of the same kind of wood, and were filled with more books than I'd seen in the local bookstore the one time I'd convinced Britney to stop by on our way home after school.
 They were all hardbound, with leather bindings and engraved covers.
 There was a stereo system off in one corner, hooked up to a laptop and some kind of portable music player.

Rodregas lacked the discipline to channel the power.
 Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs senses were acute on things arcane and he felt the coming flood of power as if it was a real physical thing.
 Van‚Äôdret spread his hands and made a frantic move that sent a corona of power around him.
 Of course no focused magic came near him, and what did occur startled even Rodregas.

 She did not land smoothly, colliding into Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs lower body, but she instantly straightened and thrust her dagger into Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs stomach.
 The dagger did not sink far; a few inches.
 Rodregas expected Van‚Äôdret to get his hands up and fend her off, but he seemed to be in shock.
 Imeralda pulled the dagger out and then viscously stuck it back in the sorcerer, her body moved with the stroke, clearly using every ounce of strength she had.
 Still the blade only stuck in a few inches, but Van‚Äôdret screamed and fell to the floor and started to drag himself away.

 Still, he double-checked the keep and the courtyard very carefully before bringing out the cart and the horses and loading up all his booty.
 The cart groaned with the load.
 After a last check for Dire Cats in front of the keep he headed out and away from both Raven Keep and Raven Town and away from his old life.
 CHAPTER 4 A FRESH START OR AN OLD PROBLEM
 Raven Keep, unlike many fortifications, was not located on a high spot.
 In fact, it was perched half way down a gentle valley.
 Farther down the valley, only a few minutes‚Äô ride away was Raven Town.
 Even the kindest of folk would admit the town was not much more than an inn, a stable, the homes of the people that supported the local farming community, and of course, Raven Keep.
 Many of the keep employees and their family members lived in Raven Town.

The so-called ‚Äòshock therapy‚Äô strategy pursued by these countries has been widely criticized for its severity and seeming indifference to social costs.
 But debates regarding the appropriate speed and social cost of reforms divert attention from a more fundamental problem with this approach.
 The essence of shock therapy is a reliance on macro-economic factors to bring about a radical restructuring of the economy and a radical change in the behaviour of individuals and enterprises.
 While monetary policy may prove useful for dealing with short-term adjustment problems within a relatively stable environment, there is no evidence to support its use as the principle instrument for social transition.
 Monetary variables are indicators of the functioning of an economy, but the essential factors which determine the strength and health of an economy are the productivity of its enterprises and its workforce and the material resources of the country.
 Tight monetary policy can generate intense short-term pressure for change in behaviour, but this pressure is applied indiscriminately and often with unexpected and unanticipated results.
 The primary result of premature liberalization of prices was to encourage trade and speculation while discouraging production and investment.
 It distracted attention from fundamental changes in institutions and social attitudes needed for the transition to be successful.
 Macro-level policy measures have to be complemented and supported by parallel micro-level efforts to educate the population about the new economic system, to generate a free flow of information ‚Äì not just freedom, but the actual exchange of information, which is still severely limited in these countries ‚Äì to develop new distribution systems, to impart appropriate business and managerial skills, to provide access to credit, to build up new social institutions and to en courage and promote new enterprises.
 In most cities of the former Soviet Union, for instance, there is not a single whole sale market for food.

 My face felt numb.
 Somewhere in the distance, the door opened and the vibration in Steed‚Äôs chest quieted as his words cut off.
 My head turned dazedly toward the door, keeping it steady against Steed.

At the same time, lifting the tyranny of state terrorism has itself become the occasion in some instances for an outburst of violence by long suppressed groups.
 Eradication of terrorism is possible, but it demands a comprehensive and integrated approach and concerted, collective action.
 The commercialization of the arms trade ‚Äì which benefits some countries economically at the expense of the security of all nations ‚Äì must be subject to rigorous monitoring and control by international agencies.
 Vested economic interests that thrive on conflict must be placed under UN surveillance and regulation.
 International institutions must be strengthened to eradicate arms smuggling, narcotics, offshore money laundering and other criminal activities that serve as seedbeds and instruments for terrorism.
 However, no final solution to the problem of terrorism can be arrived at by force alone.
 While terrorism is frequently attributed to religion and ideology, it sprouts and thrives most readily among populations that lack opportunities for gainful employment and economic development.
 Social unrest is an expression of the upward aspiration of those who have been left out of the political and development process or who feel threatened by the rapid pace and stress of social change and inequity.
 Those who lack the opportunity or the ability to labour intensely for their own upliftment express their productive energies through the intensity of violence.
 The international community cannot afford to be silent spectators of the growing violence.

But her eyes flew open when she felt his hand slide under her skirt to squeeze her thigh.
 Panicking, she tried to push him away.
 But he pinned her against the back of the sofa, his mouth becoming rough.
 She tried to break away from him because he was kissing her so hard that her teeth were cutting into her lips; she could taste the blood.
 But he wouldn't let her go.
 And then he pushed his tongue into her mouth, and shock and disgust fused with the pain to give her the strength to shove him away.
 Marie could only stare at him as she raised trembling fingers to her bruised and bleeding lips.

I was recalling the details, her dark hair blowing in the wind, the feeling of being trapped, when my thoughts faded into the blackness of sleep.
 I woke in my own bed, the room lit by the dim light of a single flame suspended above my table.
 A flash of embarrassment hit as it dawned on me Chevelle must have placed me there; he must have seen my home, my room.
 And then I smiled, because he had left me a flame.
 I stretched my entire body, rejuvenated from the rest.
 I was unsure how long I‚Äôd slept but it looked like the sun was rising again and I wanted to be out of the house before I ran into Fannie.
 It was probably too early to hope to see Chevelle.
 I‚Äôd spent the last two days with him, but he hadn‚Äôt revealed anything of himself and that had only made me more curious.
 I retrieved the documents I‚Äôd hidden after my second trip to the library to find out whether they added anything to the report from the Council‚Äôs record-keeper.
 There wasn‚Äôt much new there, mostly more names, but I did notice a watermark on one of the pages.

 They didn‚Äôt need to, for they had numbers, momentum, and morale.
 When Antonil shoved to the front line, they also had leadership.

 ‚ÄúThose in the back, flush them out of the houses.‚Äù

 If they have been tracking me since I let them out, they don‚Äôt seem to want to do any great harm.‚Äù With that Rodregas got out of the wagon and started to pull the horses into the barn.
 Their noses were flaring, and he had to pull them almost to the opening.
 As soon as they got close they both went charging in; they sensed the barn was shelter to keep them safe from the Dire Cats.
 Like the farmhouse, the barn was also built of the same impressive large cut stone.
 However, while the stone was in great shape, all other materials seemed to have fallen apart.
 There were several small trees and bushes growing in the barn.
 The floor was also stone, and there was not enough dirt and debris for them to grow very large.
 They had to clear a path to get the wagon in.

Per hectare consumption averages just 13 per cent of the level in India and 3.5 per cent of the level in China.
 Recent studies indicate that the area under irrigated crops could be expanded four to five times, primarily through small, private irrigation systems.
 Improved farm systems have demonstrated that they can raise the yields of most crops in the region.
 Changes in agricultural policy can improve the efficiency in factor and output markets, raise the incentives of private small farmers, and improve technology generation and dissemination.
 Institutional reform can improve marketing and distribution services.
 Investment in infrastructure can significantly lower marketing costs.
 Indigenous technological capacities can be strengthened to develop location-specific technologies, rather than relying on direct material transfer of crop varieties unsuited to local conditions.
 Greater emphasis on the training of local manpower can significantly improve the effectiveness of agricultural extension systems and integrated rural development projects.
 Special Status of Agriculture
 The obvious limitations of government-directed agricultural development, coupled with the resurgent popularity of free-market policies following the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the successful completion of the GATT negotiations, raise fundamental issues about the status of agriculture and the role of government in this sector.

It seemed like he was giving orders though, and that they weren't being received very well.
 A few minutes later Alec bundled me into the back seat of an unfamiliar car, which rapidly filled up as first Jasmin, Isaac and the tiny Hispanic girl arrived.
 Jasmin completely ignored me as she climbed into the car; Isaac gave me a polite, if somewhat cool nod.
 The Hispanic girl gave me an honest-to-goodness smile as she slipped behind the steering wheel and started the engine.
 In what was one of the most thoughtful things that'd happened all night, she turned the heater on full as she pulled out of the driveway.
 The drive into town, and then back out to my house was quiet, but luckily didn't take as long as normal.
 Apparently her timidness stopped well short of observing the speed limit.
 Alec, Isaac, and Jasmin all jumped out of the car as soon as my house was in sight.
 The car was still doing at least twenty miles per hour when they bailed.
 They faded into the darkened landscape about the time we rolled to a stop.

Even before I'd gotten old enough to attend Prom, I'd still invariably spent the day grouchy and depressed.
 Things only got worse as I'd aged, presumably because I wasn't really as indifferent as I liked to pretend, and I couldn't hide behind the excuse of being too young to be asked anymore.
 My pulse had already skyrocketed; I almost didn't hear what Rachel was saying over the pounding in my ears.
 "...of course it's still a little ways away, but a girl like Britney starts early so she gets as high up the social food chain as possible."
 Rachel's words calmed me a little at the same time they sparked confusion.
 I'd never heard her be quite so cynical.
 It was completely at odds with the innocent, accepting exterior she usually displayed.
 My surprise must have leaked through.
 Almost as soon the thought crossed my mind Rachel's demeanor crossed back from the older, jaded visage, to one that was more youthful, even embarrassed.
 "Sorry, I know she's your friend.

Mr. Rindell's appearance forestalled what I'd been sure would turn into a full-blown fight.
 He sized up the situation with the canny eye of an educator who'd seen more fights over his career than most gang leaders.
 "Class is about to start, and if every one of you isn't where you're supposed to be before the bell rings, you'll have detention for the next month."
 Vincent's hiss was still almost inaudible.
 "This isn't over."
 I felt my knees almost collapse as the two packs slowly backed away from each other, and Jasmin joined me inside the classroom.
 Mrs. Campbell gave the two of us a considering look after reading Jasmin's note, but sent us off to a pair of empty seats at the back of the classroom without comment.
 We were starting a new unit, but I couldn't concentrate on the lecture.
 Alec's unshakable calm over the last few days had mostly convinced me the other members of his pack had been overreacting.
 Somehow I'd come to believe the coming dispute with Brandon's pack would be resolved as easily as a normal teenage dispute.

They seldom survived the rampages, but were nearly unstoppable when they fell into one.
 Rodregas breathed deeply, trying to lower his own anger and frustration.
 Jordaan stepped outside the room Rodregas had been staying in and into the small clearing that was the center of the Nymph Dwello, the tent like structure that they used for houses.
 ‚ÄúGentleman, please,‚Äù said Jordaan.
 ‚ÄúYou must have understood that this village took a great risk in taking you, and those you rescued, in.

 Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs eyes were literally glowing red and he was tossing his horned head with his wild black hair flying.

 When teachers praised me, it always made me feel like I was socially deficient.
 I didn't necessarily mind the fact that I spent hours more on homework than any of my peers, but being praised for it always felt like a backhanded insult.
 "It's okay, I'm not going to slack off.
 I want to be done with extra assignments as badly as you want to be finished with having to grade them."
 My feeble joke evoked a smile, but I wasn't quite free to go.
 "Well, your homework is easier to grade than most.
 I also wanted to let you know that I'm happy with what you've been doing at the lab, and to give you this."
 As unbelievable as it was considering that most of my classmates seemed more concerned with working their fast-food jobs than with doing homework, the plain envelope she handed me contained my very first paycheck.

All the things I would've told my mom had instead been shared with Rachel.
 Best of all, there'd been absolutely no hint that she'd blabbed to anyone else.
 I settled deeper into my seat, opening my program as the orchestra started warming up.
 It was amazing to think the near-chaos currently drifting up from the pit would transform itself into the glorious strains of the Overture in just a few minutes.
 I was so intent on the program it should've taken a small explosion to bring my head around, but something caused me to look up as Alec walked past the drapes.
 He looked even more gorgeous than normal.
 I'd gone back and forth, both with myself, and with Rachel, on how much to dress up.
 Going in normal street clothes would've cheapened the experience, but I hadn't wanted to stick out too much from the rest of the kids, all of whom I'd been pretty sure would be in shorts and polos.
 I'd been right, which had made me glad I'd compromised and come in my one and only sun dress.
 Alec apparently hadn't gotten the memo.

After all, Olga had no kids.
 If God asked me to surrender Zo√´, not just deliver her into his care in some spiritual sense, but say to give her up, send her to live with her mother or grandma, I believe I would rescind any surrender pledge I had made.
 Meaning I‚Äôm probably light years from honest to God surrender.
 And perhaps I‚Äôm light years from devoting myself to communion with God.
 Even on lesser matters than Zo√´, such as writing books and building the Perelandra College writing programs (another of my obsessions), I hesitate to cut back in order to devote more time to communing with God.
 Even during these meditative times on the road, since Pismo Beach I have devoted as much to thoughts of the book that will come of the journey as to whether it all will help me live more like Brother Lawrence.
 I wonder, if I were given the choice between writing a wonderful book or achieving deeper communion, which would I choose?
 The woman I call Sweet still haunts me.
 I imagine if some good Christian folks would suggest that God might have sent her to me, others would assure me she was in the devil‚Äôs employ.
 Whether she came from God, the devil, or by pure coincidence is academic to me.

When he finally spoke again, I realized his offer of help wasn‚Äôt a request.
 ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs begin with histories.‚Äù He flicked the middle finger of his left hand and a thick ivory tome flew from a shelf, opened, and steadied between us as if on a table.
 There was something so wrong about it, but I couldn‚Äôt say why.
 I pushed away the urge to question an associate of Council, instead asking, ‚ÄúChevelle?‚Äù He smiled.
 It was only one word, but he understood.
 I was asking if I could address him in the common dialog, not the official titles and formalities of the Council he might have been used to.
 His head tilted in a nod.
 And we sat so, tucked in the narrow space behind a small library table, for hours.
 He pulled books between us and returned them to the shelves, never once glancing at the papers spread out beside us referencing the northern clans.
 Nothing we studied touched on the histories of those clans.

The texture under the skin felt like bundles of large, powerful cables.
 He felt his face break into a smile; he had seen this face smile when it had been a prisoner.
 The smile the prisoner had worn was a very open charming smile.
 The smile he felt on his face now had little resemblance to the one he remembered seeing, though without looking in the mirror he had no way of knowing for sure.
 ‚ÄúCome on up, Korin.

 He went around the room one final time poking around for anything else of note and, finding nothing, went over to the door to the water closet.
 Inside he first tested out the plumbing, finding the experience both new and familiar.
 He also had a chance to examine his own plumbing, and was pleased with the results; his new body was large and powerfully built even in places that most people would not see.
 The only thing of use in the water closet was a shaving kit which Rodregas added to the trunk.

 The two brothers lived in the poorest part of town, sheltered in an old building long abandoned.
 When they had first arrived, several homeless men claimed it as their own.
 Harruq had slit their throats when they slept and then Qurrah worked his art.

Our teammates were mostly the older sons of squatter families whose homes, made of scraps of tin, wood, and cardboard, balanced on narrow ridges along the walls of the Ca√±on del Sol, which ran down off the mesa to the border.

He scowled at the chicken as he took it from the oven.
 How was he going to help her get back?
 He didn't have much faith-- Marie's scream almost made him drop the chicken.
 Depositing the pan on the stove, he ran to the living room.
 She was sitting up, gasping for breath, a look of terror on her face.
 "What's wrong?"
 he asked, hovering over her.
 "I want to go home!
 I don't belong here--I want to go home!"
 Her heart was beating wildly, and she was having a hard time catching her breath.

No, no, no," he groaned, refusing to let her put her arms around him or kiss him.

 His groan was deeper this time, and he turned away from her, dropping his head into his hands.
 "Please go to bed, Marie."
 "But Rick--" "Just go to bed.
 Please."
 He didn't look up when she finally complied.
 He'd never known such ecstatic misery.
 He wanted her so much that, 20 minutes after she'd gone, his hands were still trembling.

 She linked her arms around his neck, smiling into his eyes and then raising her face to kiss him.
 His hands wandered over her back as he returned her kiss.
 "Wow," he murmured, resting his forehead against hers.
 "I predict our house is soon going to be full of all kinds of knickknacks and gadgets."
 Smiling, she pulled him closer for another kiss.
 He was constantly thinking of her, buying her gifts and designing adventures for her.

 She looked a bit out of breath, like she had sprinted at a run to the Dwello.
 She took a quick look at Doi‚Äôvan and Rodregas and paled.
 Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs eyes were literally glowing red and he was tossing his horned head with his wild black hair flying.
 Imeralda had not seen him in such a mood before, not even during the battle with the slave caravan.
 Imeralda thought that Rodregas was only marginally better.
 The muscles of his neck and shoulders were bunched up and she could feel his anger through her bond with him.
 But he was also breathing deeply and through the bond she knew he was trying to control himself.

‚ÄúI'm sorry to interrupt your playful banter, but are we actually looking for a place in particular or just some random cave?‚Äù Emily's annoyed voice asked us from behind.
 ‚ÄúYes, just a random cave or a place to stay.
 Why?‚Äù Seth asked, just as annoyed.
 ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúa cave won't be found in a forest, so shouldn't we be finding a way out of the forest?‚Äù ‚ÄúI know that, Emily,‚Äù he said and pointed to the trees.
 ‚ÄúCan you find a way out?
 It just goes on and on.
 I'm hoping that we find a clearing soon.‚Äù ‚ÄúFine,‚Äù she said and crossed her arms, ‚ÄúI'm sorry I interrupted your conversation.‚Äù Then she started talking to Jason again.
 Seth made a cat noise and clawed the air, ‚ÄúSomeone's a pussy cat today.‚Äù ‚ÄúBe quiet Seth or she'll hurt you,‚Äù I said and looked over my shoulder.
 Emily seemed to have heard that and she winked at me.

I know a Celestial lion was used in the ceremony and whoever our Paladin is I assume he now has it‚Äôs essence, and those two were taken as the Celestial‚Äôs mates.‚Äù  Imeralda and Doi‚Äôvan looked at him, and then she slowly added, ‚ÄúAnd what was one of your first actions?

 Dire Cats are smarter than regular lions; they might see you as an ally or part of their herd.
 No wait, I think with cats you call them prides.
 But I wonder how they see Doi‚Äôvan and me?‚Äù she asked.
 Neither Doi‚Äôvan nor Rodregas had an answer to that question.
 ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Rodregas said, ‚Äúwe need to find shelter and if they meant us harm us they would not have shown themselves.
 It‚Äôs getting dark.
 Let‚Äôs get the horses into the barn.

What does that have to do with her going or staying?‚Äù Rodregas asked.

 ‚ÄúDo you love her?‚Äù ‚ÄúOf course, I would not travel this distance for anyone else.
 Imeralda is an amazing young woman‚Ä¶ beautiful, intelligent, charming and potentially a very powerful magician.
 I cherish every moment with her.‚Äù Rodregas‚Äô heart sank at the news.
 Life with the powerful healer would be a far better one than one with his lost crusade.
 ‚ÄúSince you would ask me such a personal question, I have one for you.‚Äù Jordaan responded, ‚ÄúYou are clearly struggling with what it means that Imeralda is a half Nymph, but have you thought about what is means that she is a half AElf?

The free market system is highly regulated and controlled by the very state over which it claims victory.
 But although in reality both systems are dead, the ideology of the capitalist system lives on and casts an illusory impression of supremacy.
 Rather than searching for a victor and vanquished, the urgent need is to find a successor that combines and synthesizes the enlightened values of both systems ‚Äì freedom and equality, liberty and security.
 It has been amply proved that the authoritarian state is incapable of exerting a benevolent authority over the people without imposing severe restrictions on freedom, stifling human energy and creativity, leading sooner or later to rising discontent and a loss of social vitality.
 It is also abundantly clear that money as an institution operating through the free pricing mechanism of the market system ‚Äì although it does succeed in generating high levels of energy, creativity and productivity ‚Äì regards people as a purchasable commodity or a potential market, but is otherwise indifferent to human values and welfare.
 Neither the determinism of the state nor the determinism of the market can be adequate in themselves to achieve the goals of peace and prosperity that we strive after.
 It has been generally assumed that the transition now taking place in Eastern Europe will sooner or later lead these countries to adopt forms of government and economy identical to those prevalent in the West.
 But for those raised in a society that offered a great measure of social security, the poverty and insecurity of the Western system are gross inadequacies.
 While it is clear that these new democracies have rejected the authoritarian statist system, it is not yet clear what finally they will accept, discover or invent as a more acceptable alternative.
 The creativity and inventiveness they have exhibited in seeking an alternative in the past may quite possibly lead them to discover that better social system which both East and West are in need of.

There are even winds of change in the Middle East, where Jordan has recently shown the way by conducting free elections.
 The role of democracy in development would be even more compelling were it not for the apparently contradictory evidence posed by the recent experience of Russia and China.
 Russia hastened to introduce democratic reforms in the hope that they would lead to rapid economic advancement.
 China preferred to postpone political reforms until the economic transition was much further advanced.
 As an immediate result, China has the highest economic and employment growth rates among the nations of the world, while Russia has experienced three successive years of steeply declining national income.
 These differences are of vital importance, but they centre around the issue of the best strategy for the transition in human terms, not on the ultimate importance of democracy to continuous economic development.
 The opening up to foreign trade and investment, the spread of higher education which is essential to achieve global competitiveness and the rising living standards which the market system will generate ‚Äì all serve to undermine the legitimacy and staying power of the single-party system.
 China has released a social movement that is rapidly shifting power from the Party to market-responsive institutions and special interest groups, which include wealthy entrepreneurs, provincial officials, workers and peasants.
 Final assessment of China‚Äôs strategy will be determined by the further response of the political system to rising social expectations and growing pressure for greater individual freedom.

His strength was fading fast, and he had little doubt that if he passed out he would never wake.
 He struggled to lift a single numb hand, then flopped it down on top of the dead elf‚Äôs leg.
 Qurrah took as deep a breath as he dared and then spoke the words of a spell.
 Each syllable was slow torture, garbled in blood and born of pain most horrid.
 Thankfully, the spell was not complicated, and the words were few.
 He finished the spell mere seconds before his mind succumbed to the sleep that crawled at his eyes.
 Even though he was dead, life energy still swirled inside the elf‚Äôs body.
 Normally this energy would be consumed by the earth in burial, but Qurrah had other plans.
 His spell took in this life energy through his hand, filling his body with it, healing his wounds and clearing his mind.
 The darkness fighting for control in his head subsided, a shred of strength returning to his limbs.

Even before our tequila arrived, the Marines were telling us about a training film.
 It showed photos of camouflaged pits where guys fell onto sharpened and poisoned poles, and tunnels through which soldiers had to crawl chasing invisible warriors.
 Maybe the thoughts of death by poison or stabs in the dark made my stomach roil.
 Or maybe the cause was the sight of a dancer on the stage beside the bar.
 She was naked except panties sagged around her knees.
 I thought, the babe with auburn hair could be here in her place, if instead of having folks who were churchgoing gringos she had gotten born where I imagined this stoned, lost and weepy dancer had, as the fifteenth child of someone who lived in a hut beside a brown river.
 When a fellow vacated his bar stool, I excused myself from the table and moved there.
 I ordered another shot of tequila, and stared at the mirror behind the liquor shelf, wondering if I looked any different than before I surrendered to Jesus.
 I couldn‚Äôt spot a single feature that appeared more saintly or pure.
 I felt no more likely to hand over my jacket to whomever asked, let alone to throw in my shirt.

Two years later, we moved to Chico, California for a job with more security, which we craved on account of the little ones.
 But security only exists as a craving.
 Even though the college in Chico gave me tenure, so they couldn‚Äôt have fired me unless I kidnapped the president or his wife or daughter, I had to leave it behind because Laura and I split apart and my kids, whom I loved more than life, health, art or anything, went to live in San Diego.
 I tried commuting (1000 mile weekend trips) for a while but, feeling what I imagine was a similar emptiness to that of Mexicans who labor up here for their families in Mexico, I chucked the best job I‚Äôll probably ever have and returned to San Diego.
 In those first years back, the times I lived for were coaching Cody and the team during practices and ball games at Kuhlken Field, home of La Mesa National Little League.
 Named after my dad since he had been president and organized the renovation of the field.
 During our games, pulling for Cody, I came to understand why a father I knew dropped dead in the stands, when his heart failed while his son was pitching.
 As teenagers, my kids carried on the family tradition of abject rebellion, to the degree that I wrote a Reader story about the Tough Love group I was attending weekly.
 The year my kids began to climb out of the mud, I met Pam.
 * Back when I had only one child, someone told me that two was as easy or easier than one.

By the time I made it into English and sat down next to Britney, my heart felt like it was going to seize up.
 Mr. Whethers walked into class a few seconds after the bell rang, took one look at his already perspiring students, and told us all to go ahead and spend the time reading rather than worrying about trying to focus on a lecture.
 It was a nice gesture, and normally I would have appreciated it, but I'd just finished Wuthering Heights, and knew that flipping the book back open wasn't going to help distract me.
 Unwilling to spend another hour in worry, I let my thoughts drift over to another, dangerous area.
 Thinking about Brandon wasn't safe anymore.
 He'd started out making my stomach knot up simply because he was so gorgeous, but lately my insides had started jumping around for other reasons.
 I wiped away the light sheen of perspiration on the back of my neck, and wished the world was simpler.
 If only I was still in Minnesota, or anywhere other than this crazy, secretive town with its ridiculous share of gorgeous boys.
 Boys who didn't behave much at all like any other popular kids I'd ever known.
 Alec hated me, Brandon stopped by to give me a ride to school every day, and neither of them should have even realized I was alive.

Another usher, this one thankfully no more fawning than the first, pointed me towards my seat, and I felt my second surge of disappointment for the night.
 My seat was on the main level, but it was only three rows from the very top, and all the way off to one side.
 I guess it really wasn't that surprising.
 If the school was paying for the tickets I should just be glad I hadn't been stuck with a standing room only spot.
 Still, as disappointing as it was that the performers were only barely going to be visible, it wasn't as bad as the nagging worry that Rachel wasn't coming after all.
 We'd spent almost every second together talking about how much fun we were going to have seeing Les Mis√©rables together.
 She'd even still been excited about the bus ride.
 Given everything she'd said, I'd anxiously waited for her to show up at the departure point.
 It'd seemed impossible, but as Mrs. Alexander had gently herded me onto the bus, there'd still been no sign of her.
 "Maybe she's driving instead of taking the bus down.

Rachel cherishes her few remaining illusions.
 One of the most important is the pretense that nobody knows just how hard it is sometimes for her to be the only human in a house full of shape shifters."
 I felt my lips trembling, and he freed one of his hands to brush it lightly across my mouth.
 "You've been a godsend for her, Adri.
 As badly as it hurts each time she sneaks away, it hasn't happened nearly as often since you got here.

The comprehensive conceptual model needs to be complemented by the development of models for employment, food, education, trade and other fields that go beyond the national or sectoral approach to show the impact of the complex interactions that are key determinants of the development process ‚Äì for instance, the impact of democracy on agriculture and of increasing agricultural productivity on employment, industrialization and trade, the impact of rising education on democratization, social tolerance for diversity, personal expectations and social stability.
 Once formulated, these conceptual models need to be applied under a variety of conditions to test their validity and demonstrate the value of a comprehensive approach to development.
 Therefore, we have proposed that the UN adopt a number of districts in different regions of the world, including crime-ridden inner cities or impoverished rural areas in industrial countries, to evolve and apply strategies for their rapid transition to a higher level of development.
 Six Goals in Education
 Once formulated, this knowledge needs to be imparted through education.
 Education is the greatest known civilizing force and the single most powerful lever for human development.
 Training imparts skills, but education increases the capacity of the individual at a more basic level, making the mind more active and alert, converting physical energy into mental energy, training us to see things from a wider perspective, to question and challenge the status quo, to think and imagine, to innovate and invent, to make decisions for ourselves and to act on our own initiative.
 Education is the process by which society passes on the accumulated knowledge and experience of countless centuries to new generations in a systematic, concentrated and abridged form, so that today‚Äôs young people can start their lives at the high point of knowledge and wisdom attained by preceding generations.
 Education replaces the slow, subconscious process of trial and error learning with a swift, conscious process.
 This accumulated knowledge is a great power that can be utilized to accelerate human development and abridge the time needed for society to arrive at progressively higher levels of material, social and psychological fulfilment.

Even if this intention cannot immediately be made effective, the adoption of this Peace Imperative would mark a milestone in human affairs.
 There is no rational or practical obstacle to the immediate adoption of this measure.
 As a starting point, it can be demonstrated that with the right perspective, courage and commitment, practical immediate solutions are possible for any and all of the conflicts presently raging.
 Recent failures of international diplomacy do not contradict this assertion, they confirm it.
 War must, and can, be abolished.
 Nuclear Weapons
 The threats to future peace come in many forms and at many levels, but unquestionably the most pernicious and potentially devastating is the peril from nuclear weapons.
 The end of the nuclear arms race between the superpowers may have removed the looming fear of all-out nuclear war and annihilation that surfaced in the artistic drawings of young American school children in the mid-1980s, but the horrible genie of Hiroshima and Nagasaki will continue to haunt us until every nuclear weapon has been destroyed.
 The very existence of the nuclear stock piles carries its own inherent dynamism for their utilization, which is likely to be expressed intentionally or accidentally sooner or later.
 There have been repeated efforts by the non-aligned nations to move a resolution in the UN General Assembly that the use of nuclear weapons should be declared a crime against humanity and outlawed.

Development was a slow, haphazard and largely unconscious result of countless individual efforts.
 Today, people in most developing countries are motivated by an expectation, an urge, a feverish drive for rapid advancement that has acquired the characteristics of a social revolution.
 The search for greater comfort, convenience, security and enjoyment motivates entire societies to embrace progress as their primary goal and collectively dedicate themselves to achieve it.
 The race for development has become an intense preoccupation of every nation.
 The slow pace of trial and error growth is no longer adequate to meet the rising demands of the people.
 The awakening of this compelling urge has unleashed a powerful social force for human progress.
 That force refuses to be bound by either rationality or morality.
 Revolution means to bring future results more quickly, sooner than they would come through normal evolutionary processes.
 In earlier ages, people revolted when their most basic needs were not met, when they were denied rights or oppressed.
 Today, vast sections in developing countries are stirred to action because their expectations are not fulfilled.

Her sentence included some sort of service to council and a spell binding her from using magic of any kind except practical.
 I was dumbfounded.
 It had never crossed my mind before, but as I considered it, searching for proof the documents were wrong, I realized Aunt Fannie had never used magic for anything but service.
 It hadn‚Äôt seemed unusual to me, it was just the way it had always been.
 And besides, I could barely do anything aside from lighting candles.
 Was this why council was so quick to accuse me of practicing dark magic?
 It was rarely even discussed and never tolerated.
 What had Fannie done?
 I flipped through more of the pages, realizing something was out of place.
 It didn‚Äôt make sense official documents about Fannie would be among those relating to the apparent extinction of the northern clans.

From the dead, it seemed, I had returned.
 Chevelle stepped to my right side, placing something cold and heavy in my hand.
 My sword.
 I knew what to do then.
 I took a deep, steadying breath as I raised the blade to the air.
 There was a faint pause, the briefest tick before the bird took flight, its wings hitting wind as the shift began, and then nothing could be heard but my name, roared in the song of the crowd below.

Severe fiscal constraints have forced governments to reduce drastically budgetary allocations to research institutions, leaving most of these institutions with little or no source of revenues to support their activities.
 High priority must be given to developing a detailed plan for preservation of the scientific research infra structure during the difficult transition period and for restructuring it so that it can be integrated effectively into the emerging market system.
 The drain of talents must be stopped by a concerted national effort to exploit each country's competitive advantage in science by marketing these capabilities internationally, and particularly by linking up with other countries in the region and with developing countries that can most benefit from the region's scientific and technological capabilities.
 Search for a New Model
 Ironically, despite all the international debate about transition, thus far the actual goal of the transition process has never been clearly spelled out.
 It is widely presumed to be to some form of capitalist system, but which variety ‚Äì the Swedish?
 The Japanese?
 The American?
 Although the ostensible goal of transition has been to economies based on private ownership, three years after the initiation of transition programmes, very little privatization has actually taken place in most countries of the region.
 It is widely believed that acceleration of this process will lead to rising unemployment and a widening gap between the rich and the poor, leading to the creation of a huge under class that had been virtually eradicated in previous decades.

 Emily raised an eyebrow, ‚ÄúShould we be concerned?‚Äù ‚ÄúNah they‚Äôre boys, let them do what they have to do,‚Äù I said with a quick sigh.
 While we were walking the boys appeared in front of us, holding something behind their backs.
 They seemed to be fighting giggles which usually meant they were hiding something.
 Or they were about to do something that fell under their category of ‚Äúfunny‚Äù.
 ‚ÄúHi guys,‚Äù Seth said still fighting a smirk.
 ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù I replied cautiously.
 ‚ÄúWhat are you guys hiding?‚Äù Jason‚Äôs face twisted up and a snort of laughter fought its way out of his nose.
 ‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù ‚ÄúRight‚Ä¶‚Äù Emily gave me a look that said, is this good or bad?

Seth started to stand up and signaled me to wait for him.
 He jumped over and ran out into the open.
 He leaned forward and narrowed his eyes, probably trying to see the disappearing bunch.
 He held his hand out, signaling me to wait.
 Then he beckoned me and I stood up.
 Then someone tapped me on the shoulder.
 I bit back a scream and whipped out my knife.
 But I dropped it in surprise as I spotted Emily standing over me, rocking back and forth on her heels.
 I squealed and hugged her tight.
 Jason was limping over with a grim expression on his face.

Rachel's soft blue eyes got really wide as she recoiled slightly.
 Whatever she was about to say was preempted as we were both thrown forward in our seats.
 James slid the car through a one-eighty turn that left us facing the direction we'd just come from, only a couple of feet from the start of our lane.
 "You're not making her walk!"
 It was obvious that whatever magical ability had allowed Rachel to face down the larger boy wasn't working anymore.
 He looked like he was set for a monster fight.
 "I'm not washing my car again."
 I expected Rachel to back down as soon as she realized he was spoiling for a fight, but if anything she looked more determined.
 It was hard to believe this was the same person I'd had to rescue from Cassie so recently.
 I stopped Rachel just before she could put the impressive lungful of air she'd just taken in to whatever use she'd planned.

‚ÄòIt is the farmer that has produced this miracle, not the cow.‚Äô And so it can be said of the Industrial Revolution and the Green Revolution.
 Looked at from a different perspective, the entire evolution of civilization is a progressive act of humanity‚Äôs self-discovery.
 At each stage of external observation and exploration, people have discovered more of their own inner capacity for resourcefulness.
 The material, technological, political, economic and social development of the world over countless centuries is an external expression of the growing discovery by humanity of the unlimited creative power of mental ideas, emotional aspirations, physical skills and higher values.
 The real process of creation and development is from the immaterial to the material, from the inner to the outer, from idea to invention, from aspiration to achievement, from the lofty value of freedom and the ideal of self-determination to the founding of democratic nations, from the soaring emotions of an emperor‚Äôs love to the beauty and grandeur of the Taj Mahal, from the urge for adventure to the discovery of a new continent, from the technician‚Äôs joy in expressing perfect skill to the marvellous powers of a microprocessor.
 All begin as an inner urge that expresses externally in life.
 Leadership in Thought
 In times of crisis, great leaders rise to remind us that the true resource is ourselves.
 Thus, Winston Churchill inspired the tiny British nation with the courage to stand and fight fascism when all the rest of Europe had surrendered; thus, Franklin Roosevelt halted the collapse of the US banking system during the 1930s by convincing the people that fear was their greatest enemy and that the basic economic strength of the nation was intact; thus, Gandhi inspired whole generations to fight against colonialism, apartheid and other forms of oppression in a non-violent manner; thus, Gorbachev broke down the psychological barriers to peace and human understanding that had divided the world into two opposing armed camps for four decades; and thus, Deng Xiaoping committed the Chinese nation to provide food and clothing for all its citizens, launching a period of phenomenal economic progress for one-fifth of the world‚Äôs inhabitants.
 These great acts of leadership were fundamentally acts of leadership in thought, of leaders who knew the power of human creativity and determination to achieve what few believed possible.

"Wait, what's this for?"
 The grin was back, and his teeth were still perfect.
 "I just made you spill yours, it's only fair."
 Brandon nodded at Britney, who stood there with her mouth slightly open, as he walked away.
 After a second or two of both of us staring blankly after Brandon, Britney grabbed me by the hand, the one holding the new, unopened water bottle, and pulled me over to a table in the corner.
 "Oh my gosh, you just poured water all over Brandon Worthingfield the Third.
 And then he talked to you.
 This is¬†so¬†incredible."
 I more or less fell into my seat, staring at my new bottle of water as Britney's chatter poured over me.
 It was pointless to try and pay attention to anything she was saying.

I coached their soccer, baseball and football teams for many seasons.
 I walked my boys to school, helped with their homework (as much as I could) and I tried to be an important part of their lives as well as a positive influence.
 As I continued to succeed in business, our lifestyle improved.
 Throughout their childhoods, we‚Äôve had a good life and a beautiful home, nice cars, good communities, and the best of schools.
 I encouraged their interests by making sure they had the equipment they needed to pursue them.
 For instance, when Brandon showed a real interest in and talent for photography, he received his dream camera for Christmas.
 I have loved my wife and I have shown my children that I love them.
 The boys have witnessed firsthand what a healthy spousal relationship is and that was something I never saw in my childhood home.
 I always believed in teaching my children to respect all people in all walks of life.
 On the holidays I sent my boys out to give freshly baked cookies to the people who collected our garbage.

"They were willing to kill me.
 They wanted to trade me back to Brandon."
 It came out as something less than a whisper, but apparently Alec's hearing was acute enough to catch that too.
 Alec drew me close, heedless of the open door and the twenty staring kids.
 He placed the side of his face against mine and whispered into my ear.
 "I'm not going to let anything happen to you.
 If there's a way to keep you safe I'll find it."
 The feel of his breath caressing my cheek sent tingles racing through my entire body, but even that couldn't completely reassure me.
 Still, I gave it my best effort, and if my smile wasn't entirely convincing, it was at least good enough to temporarily reassure Alec.
 I followed him into class, pausing while he handed his note to Mrs. Sorenson.

 Then he nodded and said, ‚ÄúIn the name of the All-Father, Lord of Sky and Earth and Water, I swear that I will keep your secrets.‚Äù Rodregas nodded and relaxed slightly; few would dare break a promise to the All-Father.
 Rodregas decided that Brit and Geor were like pale shadows as they quickly followed suit.
 When he turned to the last two he saw that they were very interested in what he was saying.
 ‚ÄúWhere do you go, Sir Paladin?‚Äù He showed no sense of humor at Rodregas‚Äô little joke about being a Paladin; Rodregas hoped Doi‚Äôvan had not taken him literally.
 ‚ÄúAs far as I can, is my main plan at the moment.

After Spanish, Jasmin had escorted me to Mrs. Campbell's class.
 Telling her I wasn't going to be able to help out at the lab anymore had been one of the harder things I'd ever done, but she'd been surprisingly understanding.
 We'd scheduled my makeup test for the next day and I'd left with the sneaking suspicion she'd guessed more about what was really going on in Sanctuary than either pack would've liked.
 I'd been busy contemplating what Mrs. Campbell might have really figured out as we left the building, only to have Jasmin interrupt my musings with an apology of all things.
 She didn't get into specifics, and it was obvious she was still worried about the coming showdown with Brandon, but I was pretty sure she really was sorry.
 It didn't make us best friends and she was still an enigma, but it was a start.
 It even gave me hope maybe Jessica and James might eventually come around.
 I was still reeling in surprise as we walked out to the parking lot and met up with the rest of the pack, or rather the rest of the pack minus Alec.
 He'd shown up several minutes later, looking very satisfied with himself, but obviously unwilling to answer any questions.
 As we caravanned home, I realized the collection of vehicles carrying us back to Alec's estate probably cost more than my house.

It was like I'd had too much forced on me too quickly.
 I wanted to just collapse and let unconsciousness overcome me, but something pulled me onward towards the next series of pictures, and then the next after that.
 I wanted to stop.
 Each piece opened up another fragment of my soul, revealing a new pain that I'd kept hidden for the last few months.
 The last picture was next to a door, which I opened almost without realizing I was doing so.
 The organized confusion of a true artist met my gaze.
 I'd seen it with my mom, when she was so driven to complete a shot that she couldn't be bothered to clean up after herself.
 She left just enough structure to the mess to find needed tools, but didn't waste any effort on anything that wouldn't help her with her great aim.
 Brushes were scattered everywhere, old and new canvases stacked in the corners of the studio, and flecks of paint had found their way onto almost every visible surface.
 The rich smell of paint was nearly overpowering, but I noticed it only in passing as I made a beeline towards the easel that dominated the center of the space.
