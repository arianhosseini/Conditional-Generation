Eugene – I wasn’t playing.
 I was training.
 It was hard work.
 Jim – How long did you play for?
 Eugene – Twenty minutes.
 Johnny – You blew through all ten dollars in just twenty minutes?
 Eugene – What do you mean blew through?
 The arcade manager said he had never seen someone with my level of skill before in all his years of working at that arcade.
 In fact he said that he’d never forget the experience of watching me play.
 I’m just that good.

 – You did it with a lot of effort, but you still blew through all the money. Johnny – You got the last one. Jim – You got the last two. Eugene – You got the last one. Jim – You got the last two. Johnny – You got the last one. Eugene – You got the last one. Johnny – You got the last one. Eugene – You got the last one. Johnny – You got the last one

The clip swung from smoker to smoker.
 I got up and went to school early the next day, and then my daily routine would repeat itself.
 Somehow I willed myself to stick it out at school despite my surroundings and the influences of my peers.
 I don’t know what it was that enabled me to do this, to not fall entirely into the wasteland of addiction and entitlement.
 Biology?
 Character?
 It’s inexplicable, really.
 All of my roommates had dropped out of high school but somehow I continued; although my grades sucked, they were passing grades.
 In my senior year I only took classes until noon because that is all I needed to graduate.
 I got another job at a local restaurant for the lunch shift as well as any days I was off from the grocery store.

“Why do you think this happened to me?
 I mean, we’ve tried to figure out how I can get back, but we don’t even know why it happened.” “I don’t know, Marie.
 I still can’t really believe it happened.
 If you hadn’t been scared half to death, I would have thought you were playing a joke on me.” She smiled a bit.
 “If you’re playing a joke on me, I want to take one of your televisions home with me.”  Returning her attention to the mushroom, she frowned.
 “And that’s another thing—why 84 years in the future?
 Why not five years?
 Or 100 years—at least that’s a round number.
 Why the year 2011?” Her questions made him reflect uncomfortably.
 The fact that he’d read an article about her just days before she’d appeared couldn’t be a coincidence.

Britney quickly used up her allotment of complaints, and then subsided into silence as she led the way to an out-of-the-way corner of the old school.
 I'd noticed Britney liked to position herself so she was closest to the middle of the hall.
 Admittedly, dodging all the people trying to get into their lockers wasn't much fun, but I suspected her real motivation was a desire to ensure she could see and be seen, which was much more easily accomplished by relegating me to the outside position.
 Normally I'd have just viewed her theatrics with amusement, but it'd been a long day and I wasn't in the mood.
 If I'd known for sure where we were heading, I'd have considered cutting her off, even with all of the probable fallout, but I didn't.
 Instead I just sighed, followed her around a corner, and collided with six-plus feet of muscled goodness packaged in a white polo shirt that looked worryingly familiar.
 Brandon caught me as I rebounded from him, easily stopping my momentum before I could stumble into a locker.
 "We'd better be careful; I'm starting to sense a trend."
 I wanted to say something equally witty, but his shirt did wonderful, probably illegal things to his gray eyes, and his perfectly straight teeth were parted in a friendly grin that couldn't possibly be meant for me.
 I managed a feeble grin before the silence stretched too far towards becoming uncomfortable, but it was a pathetic attempt.
